"I've been playing Man v Fat football since the end of July. Lost 10kg very quickly, then plateaued but felt much healthier than I had in years and as the months wore on my stamina and confidence on the pitch has improved massively. 

My team won the league last season, just before Easter. We've had a couple weeks off, new season starts tomorrow. I'm expecting to have put on weight because I'm always more relaxed when there's no weigh in, but I'm really looking forward to getting stuck in again. 

If you're in the UK and are looking to lose weight but don't want a strict programme I'd recommend it. The social aspect is good and the only pressure is the pressure you put on yourself to not let your team down. You get points for tracking your food each week and there's usually a weekly exercise challenge but other than that it's up to you how you lose weight and how quickly."
"15.000 or so of our fans have traveled to Hannover for our match there and the vibes are amazing. Great weather, the nearby lake is beautiful and Köln and Hannover supporter are walking together to the stadium. 

Hopefully I get to see a better match than yesterday's at Wolfsburg."
"Lads i went to the store again to get some ice bags, what did I miss?"
"Jamie Vardy is and has been a great footballer, perhaps Leicester's greatest ever player? 

All that said, he has *perfected* the art of winning penalities. He has that patented 'run past and throw out the back leg for some contact' move locked down.

(see Wolves penalty yesterday for latest example)"
"Was pretty neutral on Wrexham but I’ve just seen ‘Rob and Ryan’ do a  Gatorade shower and the official Gatorade account replied in the comments saying ‘LET’S GOOO!’.

Utterly revolting stuff."
"After taking four points from us, bending over for our rivals in the league and knocking us out of BOTH domestic cups, it turns out that Palace are the only team who could push us down into the conference league by winning the FA Cup.

Put your house on Palace is what I’m saying here."
"Truro got promoted to the National League yesterday becoming the first Cornish team to ever reach the fifth tier of English football.

Part of their reward will be away trips to Carlisle and Gateshead, both of which are roughly seven hour trips. I know we have the 'massive long drives seem weird for Europeans but are perfectly normal for Americans' discussion on here fairly often but seven hour journeys for fifth tier football is pretty wild."
It's gonna be so boring when City inevitably win the FA Cup isn't it
"Couple of weird myths are creeping back in. 

1 that Potter was only good because of Brighton's players which just isn't true. A lot of the guys people use to discredit his time with us, he developed. 

2 that we played exciting football under him, we played the most boring possession football, 90% of the time. But it was good for our level, an impressive development from Hughton hoofball and really he was let down with our attackers constantly."
Me: Ah Palace won an FA Cup Semi. Be good to see some highlights on the sub.. oh.
"I've always liked Graham Potter because he started his career here in Sweden and took a team from amateur football to Europa League, but man, it's getting hard to justify him being good enough for the Premier League after his Brighton stint. 

If he doesn't turn it around after getting a pre season and his transfers in then I think he's toast at this level."
"Clearer audio of the Rüdiger meltdown came out and he really hit the Holy Trinity of “bad” German insults by calling the referee a Fotze (Cunt), Hurensohn (Son of a whore), and a Missgeburt (Miscarriage) in the span of like 5 seconds. 

If Rüdiger plays another minute of LaLiga football this season, I’m relegating Spanish football to the Mickey Mouse Club."
"Got a message from my 90 year old grandma which was just her with a massive glass of baileys captioned “WELL DONE PALACE”, legend"
Few things sum Emi Martinez up better than celebrating an off target penalty like he’s saved it but being beaten easily twice from range
"El Clasico last night definitely didn't disappoint after all the build up, generational meltdown by RM.

Rüdiger is actually an insane person and needs to be evaluated."
Has a team and their players ever fumbled their PR as much as Madrid this season? The petulance is off the charts and it feels like literally everyone hates them. Best of all it's over absolutely nothing.
Pretty mad how comfortable our quarter and semi final wins have been - Stockport have genuinely been our toughest opponents in the cup so far
"After years of consistent success, I think Madrid have forgotten how to handle losses."
The Premier League should have released their decision on what they're doing or not doing to City in the middle of all that uproar yesterday.
Don't understand how this victim mentality has taken over Real Madrid completely. Barcelona got absolutely screwed over by the ref and yet not a single player made a fool out of themselves
"Just remembered that we were once trashed by Stuttgarts 2nd team in the DFB Pokal during the early 00s. 

And “trashed” is putting it lightly. We lost 6:1 lmao."
Wonder how Paulo Fonseca will react when he sees Rudiger barely get any punishment while he got a domestic ban of 9 months for confrontation.  Different countries but the behaviour should merit at the least equal sanctions https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1j4eqg6/lyon_head_coach_fonseca_receives_ninemonth_ban/

"Get the dinasaurs out the fucking board. Graziano Fiorita, lecce's physiotherapist just died and they asked to postpone the game, totally normal but nooo the dinasaurs cant do that. Fucking disgrace. Its not like the game being postponed is going to impact either team. Not watching todays game, gg to whoever wins.

Just pls, someone with ambition, pls kick out the dinasaurs out of the damn league."

call me petty but the thing im most mad about trent is that he is joining this embarassing institution.
"Wrexham threads are so funny. Just full of big club flairs waving away criticisms of the way they’ve bought their way up the leagues with excuses like; ‘well at least they’re owned by Hollywood actors and not x type of deplorable ownership found in elite football’.

As we’re all aware the lower leagues and non-league football are absolutely inundated with clubs owned by criminal oligarchs, shady billionaires and Gulf States looking to rehabilitate their global image through winning the Papa John’s Trophy with AFC Fylde. Praise Deadpool and Mac from Always Sunny for scuppering their evil schemes."
"Didn't think I'd see worse tantrums in the Clasico than during the Mou/Pep era but here we are.

Wearing the white shirt always brought a sense of entitlement with it and it's probably part of what made Real Madrid so strong in the past decade. But the current team is taking it way too far."
"Enjoyed how shite Ross Barkley was when he subbed on yesterday, looked terrified.

Also last nights game was the only Barca game I’ve watched this year but I have concluded that it would be a disaster for the sport if a former Leeds player won the Balon D’or"
FA cup semi the time as the prem will be won. Very unfortunate
"Gateshead in absolute free fall in the National League. With 12 matches to play they were sitting comfortably in 4th, 12 points clear of 8th place and looked like certs to make the playoffs. 

They then lost 9 out of their 11 next games and now find themselves in 8th, although they play 7th in the final match of the season for the final playoff spot so they still have a chance. 

Don't want to jinx it (especially since we're the ones that have unexpectedly found ourselves in 7th because of their collapse) but if they do fail to make the playoffs it will be one of the biggest chokes in NL history."
"Watching past few Chelsea games, it's kinda surprising to see Palmer fall down like this.

  
He was never a player that pressed top hard to gain possession from defence or ran a lot, or try to remain back in defense, he really was a vibes player that conserved his energy to the moment when ball actually came to him, but his passes are were gery very creative and visionary, one if the finest I have seen in PL after KDB but he has really lost that touch in this back half of season. He never tries to penetrate the defence, nor is he seldom able to win even simple 1 vs 1, but worst of all, I rarely see him able to attract defenders now to himself to create space in box or near box.

  
I see his peers in Writz or Olmo who are so so better than what Palmer is doing on pitch for past two months.

  
Man, it irks more when you so often see him just standing waiting for moments to happen instead of trying to create one, and it all piles up to his uncreativity, killing counters with slow reaction and back passes.

  
In the same vain, I love Enzo and Croachella. Enzo isn't the most technically gifted player but he has an absolute massive workrate in past few matches I watched and creates chances. Same for litttguy, he always looks for opportunities to penetrate the box and is cheeky in setpieces"

Can't believe Rüdiger called the ref Timo Werner
what’s the point of Cunha pointing to or kissing the badge whenever he scores if he’s either posting something stupid or securing his departure right after? can’t eat the cake and have it too

"Begging Pep to have another one of his patented 9001 IQ moments and play Akanji as a #10 and Marmoush at RB, the world needs a Palace vs Forest final."
I’m afraid to report I can no longer be convinced that Kounde isn’t the best RB in the world. Any and all arguments will in my head be countered by “but that banger tho”
"Mbappe shouldn’t have even played El Clasico, he should’ve been banned for 3 games after his red. Madrid are just shameless crying about referees, the football world can only hope this awful year isn’t just a one off and they stay this bad because they deserve it with their behavior"
"I don’t really know any specifics about them outside the obvious bits, but I still like the Wrexham story. 

The owners were clear about their objective from the beginning, put relatively clean money into the club, have seemingly tried to care about the locals, used their advantages and networks to boost the club, and have had incredible success on the field with it. 

Especially within football’s moral standards, I have a hard time getting upset about Wrexham. If every owner was like theirs, football would be better off."
"Didn't realise this yesterday, but that Rüdiger post title is good bait for including Vinicius because it's not like entering the pitch is some mythical thing that football players never do whilst frustrated. All whilst not mentioning Vasquez on the left with their synchronised action. Just shows that Rüdiger behaviour was enough to overshadow any mention of that."

"Real Madrid - Sensible transfers (in my humble opinion)

- Angelo Stiller (One of the top progressive passers in top5 leagues, ads a lot of creativity, good at defending and has a leader-type of profile)

- Castello Lukeba (Technical and strong CB with lots of potential)

- Alex Baena (Top1 player itw in key passes in top5 leagues, if used more centrally he could be a good asset to compliment VMR)

- Alex Carreras/Miguel Gutierrez (both very solid spanish LB's and both from the academy in the past, not sure if there's someone better to fill in at LB atm)

- TAA/El Hilali (TAA is pretty much confirmed, but people are really sleeping on Omar El Hilali from Espanyol, very complete RB, very good defensively and can also fill in at CB while just 21 y.o)

I think it can't be more obvious that RM needed a rebuild, howveer last season they went full in on Mbappe and neglected urgent positions that needed to fill in. Imo, these would be the most sensible transfers for them for upcoming season. Feel free to agree/disagree. I make this comment as a neutral in LaLiga and just curious what you guys think about RM squad."

The top twelve posts on this sub are all about the same game
All the Madrid wins created so many haters in this sub. They’re having a field day this season having reasons to hate pn this club 🤣 same as with Ronaldo. Enjoy it while it lasts
I guess it's a compliment to just what high a bar he's set but it's absolutely ludicrous that people are trying to stigmatise Palmer as a big game flop when he's scored in 2 finals (3 if you count the shield) and had an excellent game in the only one he hasn't.
"Seeing the ""foul"" that was called against Mbappe that led to Rudiger acting like a disgrace, what a shocking call lmao, last minute of the game you can't give soft calls like that for dives when the ref had been so good for the rest of the game aside from the Rudiger penalty shout at the end of normal time. I'll smile when Rudiger is banned 

Also on the game the first half had me convinced Barcelona were the best team I've seen this season, hadn't watched them since they played Bayern and I was incredibly impressed with every player. Thought there might be something to the Pedri ""best midfielder in the world shouts"" just on that half. Then the second half happened.

Edit: Also can't believe that Rudiger hasn't had a red card in the past 8 years????"
"My suggestion to improve the PL relegation battle: Have a relegation playoff between the teams that finish 3rd and 4th bottom. It can be a one-off game at the home ground of the team that finished 4th bottom. This gives the bottom 3 something to fight for and creates jeopardy for the other teams in the league.

Now that every team in the league will have been there for at least 3 seasons apart from the promoted teams I think the problem will get worse not better and this would fix some of that. Even if it is the same teams that get relegated this would be more entertaining."

"The third tier of Swedish football, which is semi-professional, puts the teams from Stockholm in the same division as the teams from the furthest north.

No offense but did you really expect Crystal Palace to get more attention than a El Classico final with such drama?
"despite what our fanbase says Potter is the last problem at the club right now. Tactically we’ve been far better than we were under Lopetegui, but ultimately the squad is physically limited, old, badly put together and mentally not there, which are issues we’ve had under Potter, Lopetegui and Moyes now.

overall our performances have improved but the results haven’t, that happens sometimes. If we have a good transfer window that ideally lowers the age of our starting XI we’ll probably be fine, but that’s a big if with Sullivan"

"Complaining about teams ""buying their way up the leagues"" is such a ridiculous complaint, what else would be the point of buying a football club if the owners isn't going to do everything in their power to make the club improve as much as possible?

Funny thing is both games had a similar match winning goal
Another embarassing thing is there are Liverpool fans out here who are quite okay with this.
Agreed. That's the main reason I hate the move I hate Madrid.
"To be fair, there's a lot of shady money in the lower leagues, just a lot more local and small scale shadiness"
"If you have an issue with clubs ""buying their way up the leagues"" then you simply have an issue with private ownership of clubs in general. Which I have, all football clubs should be fan owned, but that doesn't change the fact that the Wrexham owners are the best example of how private owners of clubs should handle the situation.

But I guess the fan owned Swedish club I support is a big club because I don't think the Wrexham owners are killing football as we know it?"
Sorry but isn't buying your way to success with relatively clean owners the dream in a football pyramid where all the clubs are privately owned?
"Yeah it's pretty tiresome- if they get to the PL I'll happily root for them but they're not vanquishing giants at the moment are they. You don't hear the same people revelling in Stockport's climb.

Its just the earnestness really- I don't *hate* Wrexham but they're funny panto villains, but the Yanks don't get it. They're also in a weird spot of being not really small enough to be truly incredible (considering they've been a league side for most of their history), but not a Notts County sort of side who are on their way back to where they belong or whatever."
"Honestly don't understand why everyone cries about it. Isn't that more entertaining? 

Sportsmanship is great and all, but we need something like this from time to time. Especially in a Classico."
Baffled how Ross Barkley is still a thing in 2025
Course he is. Amass had his first decent game. A potential replacement brings out the real Shaw until the replacement is injured or miserable and then Shaw can go back to ~~hibernation~~ injured

"Im interested in if it becomes a bigger talking point that they (and Im sure others do it less obviously) can skirt PSR by giving business exposure and other non football benefits instead of wages to players, which is all off the books. Ben Foster talked about how they said like whatever you want to do, if you want to satrt a podcast we will blast it on our social media that has millions of followers, you want to start a cupcake business we will link you up with top food distributors etc whatever. The point is thats all legal right now and so easy, tbh I see a world the whole PSR system collapses around this kind of thing if more teams start exploiting it"
I hate Ryan Reynolds and his corny sense of humor

>I genuinely can’t think of a reason for why RM get away with way too much shit .

While I do agree that he should get punished accordingly, I'm tired of people acting like this treatment only applies to Madrid.

[Arda Turan literally threw his shoe at a linesman once](https://youtu.be/SbdXSBUavqo?feature=shared) and didn't even get sent off, let alone banned. La Liga has always been inconsistent and completely reliant on ref reports in their judgement of bans. Which is why I think Rüdiger will get a proper ban because the ref noted it in his match report."

Baena is a top player but he will never play for Real Madrid.
"The reality is that only Trent will come in (if that even happens).

Noobdy else will join, especially a CB. That's how Perez works now. He will look at rudiger, alaba, asencio, militao ans tchou and be satisfied despite the very obvious problems."
"Real Madrid's biggest problem is balance. I genuinely don't see how Mbappé, Vini and Bellingham can fit into one system. None of them play on the right so you need one more attacker on that side and that means you have 3 superstars with massive egoes mainly concentrating on sprinting forwards with possibly another one on the right. The only way I can see it working is if they let the three superstars do their job in attack and set the rest of the team defensively - but they are now also buying Trent.

I guess some kind of 3-4-1-2 could work but one of Mbappé/Vini will have to play as the right striker. Or a 3-4-3 with one of Mbappé/Vini/Bellingham as the right winger. Just seems like someone will always have to play out of position."

Fc Hollywood was about the drama in the boulevard press in the 90s and everything which followed is not comparable at all. 

Especially not compared to what happened under Carlo. Players organized their own training session was in my opinion caused because they were coming from a coach who micro managed every little aspect of a match, while Ancelotti was more about the freedom on the pitch.

"> future not looking good with a dysfunctional squad (holes+ star players not able to play together).

I was on the side that signing Mbappe made little sense from a sporting standpoint when Vini and he played the same position, but that's still a massive stretch. They have a great squad. They've just encountered a Barca team that will likely win a Treble."
"Future not looking good wa never the case tbh.

For this season the squad was imbalanced, but they have lots of important pieces for an amazing squad.

A few signings is all it takes to plug in their holes and they're good to go tbh"
what does being a chelsea fan have to do with this?
"Happens when it’s the clasico and a final, the biggest game in club football by all metrics innit"
This has been the greatest football game of the season though across all competitions
Youtube shorts ass comment
"Madrid has been annoying for decades, youd have to be very recent as a football fan to think this is caused by recency bias"
"I dont know why people always think the context of the time matters

he's running, he slaps garcia slightly, this is ALWAYS a foul. it sucks for the attacking player because you're moving your arms naturally, but its a foul"
that has always been given as a foul. I get its frustrating but its not some ridiculus call.
"Endrick fully kicked someone in the balls and got away with it, nothing will happen "
My suggestion is that it doesn't need improving. Not sure why a team 20 points ahead of 17th should have to win a playoff to secure their place.
"I think the issue is the typical clubs that would end up in a relegation battle are a bit too well run (Fulham, Brentford, Brighton, Forest, even Villa and us) compared to 10-15 years ago. Means you need a real basket case like Everton with point deductions and off field issues to really get at all dragged down there, and even they stayed up fairly comfortably in the end last year"
"throw 15th-18th into the playoffs with the championship 3rd-6th

2 come up others go down"
They fought all season to not be in that position and they still end up there because they’re shit as hell
"Unpopular opinion, make the league 18 teams"
Madrid lose one final and you lot start reciting poetry.
Are you okay?
"Which is weird, because man united screwing us over is usually a tale as old as time."
"That's pretty crazy, how do the clubs manage?"
"Honestly not a whole lot better than the EFL. There's only really two slots for games, Saturday afternoon and Tuesday night, but they're not shy of giving a team a massive trip on a Tuesday night."
I desperately hope so. A Palace/Forest final would be so refreshing
Its mental that madrid the greatest club in the world have actually built a team of unlikeable twats who at this moment in time actually aint very good either. Madrid really need a rebuild
This is the club that adores Juanito and Pepe is not exactly a pariah either for many Madrid fans... he'll be forgiven
I know most people who know ball already hated them but this season they seemed to have widened the scope of hatred massively.
"Yeah I’m glad we scored early because it was a really nervy game, but we didn’t really turn up but I was very impressed with them"
">You shouldn't just get to fuck off to another league because you are too good

So you're just against the concept of promotion and relegation in general?"
"the simping for madrid is crazy to me. Yes they are the biggest club in the world, but they are also the most entitled cunts you will find. I have no respect for anyone that wants to play there. Just look at bellingham he seemed like a nice kid in borussia, now he is a complete bellend."
"Oh yeah of course. Lower league football is littered with charlatans, criminals and leeches for owners. I’m not trying to paint the other clubs as paragons of virtue compared to wicked Wrexham. By the same token though there are plenty of clubs that don’t have shady ties and even a few fan owned ones."
"Yeah I do have an issue with private ownership. Wrexham were leveraging their financial power to lure players from multiple divisions above their level - how is that good for the lower levels? They might not have been ‘destroying the game as we know it’ but they weren’t helping it. I don’t actually have any specific issue with the club ,or the people that run it, but they are emblematic of the issues in the English game and praised as a feel good story all the same.

I mean you’re a fan of one of the most successful clubs in Swedish history. Elfsborg aren’t exactly minnows in the domestic game even if they aren’t as successful as Malmo. You’ve played nearly as many games in European competitions as my team have played in the top flight in our 121 year history. You don’t exactly have the perspective of clubs that spend most of their existence in the lower leagues."
I prefer the entertainment on the pitch. Also don't mind some headloss on social media. But I work a lot in grassroot football. Good luck trying to persuade a kid/teen to become a ref after the amount of shit slinging they've seen in the past 24 hours.
"This. Apart from incidents that cross lines like the Rüdiger one, I don't actually mind some toxicity and heatred and showing up with some fight.

For example, I don't think Vini did anything particularly wrong yesterday antics wise and yet he is still getting hate for that match. The problem is just, when you play shit and can't back it up and lose the game. You just have to make sure to win the game if you amp up the heat. If we won yesterday, Raphinha's and Lamine's dives would have gotten all the attention."
"I know you particularly like to say Barça fans overhype their players

But have you ever considered accepting fact that some players are just that good?  Kounde and Pedri are the best itw in their position rn no doubt"
Yeah he went the Ben White way.
"Nobody who's actually involved with Wrexham as a club treats it as an underdog story, just media and rival fans, it's stupid to get mad at them for something outsiders say about them."
"If it's any consolation, They're almost certainly going to get battered in the championship because they're squad is relatively old and there are far richer clubs in the championship than Wrexham."
"Surely that ""exposure"" has less value the farther up the ladder they go, no?

Like you're not going to get a player who would normally ask for £100k/wk in wages by retweeting his protein shake."
"Not the worst thing Arda Turan did, to be fair."
Because of Valverde?
"> Potter is wank tho.

Benefitted massively from being at a club like Brighton.

Gone to two bigger clubs with demanding  fanbases and he’s not handled it.

They’re a brilliantly run club Brighton and I’d trade places with them in an instant with how they perform but there’s no pressure inside or outside the club so they can work through the teething problems with no fanfare."
">their league form and style of football became dire under him.

To be fair they still finished 9th, and while their form in the back half of the season was piss poor, their squad was woeful. Considering they rebuilt their entire team in the summer, and what Moyes had done for them previously, I'm surprised they didn't give him a chance to right the ship with the new lads."
How much is a Liverpool mortgage?
"First time I'm glad of my Scout-related activities Curse, always lose badly when I can't watch a game because of Scout stuff"
"Yeah but Liverpool are very much a team that win games 3-1 after conceding first.

It’s also very Spurs to go 0-1 up at half time and get wrecked in the second half"
"Well your record against the bottom 3 is relatively awful, so you probably benefit by them not being included."
"Play on neutral venues, distribute matchday tickets fairly."
"He played 440 minutes in total, means fuck all."
Whats the point of the ucl if he didn’t play a single minute
"He played no minutes in that cl, as much contribution for it as I did"
Probably would've been given more chances to play at Barcelona though
"dont think he meant it for his trophy cabinet

he would 100% have had playtime, in fact i doubt barca buy olmo if they had gotten guler before"
"Man I would have liked if the game was at the Bernabeu instead. Imagine winning the league there with a dodgy penalty after winning the Copa Del Rey 2 weeks before. 

It would be in the fucking history books"
"He used to play for us and he did a lot.

Just a shame about what he’s become."
I mean it was alright but it was no Southend 3-0 Wealdstone was it
Sometimes it's not given and the game of football is better for it.
"> a team 20 points ahead of 17th

Exaggeration to make the suggestion seem silly. That's almost never the case. Most of the time it's a lot closer between 17th & 18th

It gives both 17th, even if they are safe from dropping to 18th near the end of the season, something to play for because they can escape the play off by getting 16th, and gives 18-20th something to play for if they are all in close promixity as they could sneak 18th, instead of laying down and accepting relegation. 

Not saying it's the best idea in the world but not as bad as you make out! 

Why should 3rd in the championship have to pay 6th in a play off at all either? Could easily be 20 points between them as well"
"Should the same logic not apply to the championship playoffs then? Sheffield are 22 points ahead of 5th, 23 points ahead of 6th/7th"
You could make it like Serie B where the third place gets promoted instead of going to a play off if there’s x amount of points between 3 and 4.
Because it would be entertaining - you could make the same point about the EFL playoffs and everyone love them. This idea gives so many teams something more to play for instead of half the games after Easter not mattering at all
Remember they cheated repeatedly to stay up too.
Terrible idea. The premier league sides would win too often.
Why would you do that? Just so the French and Germans don’t feel inferior?
Madrid got pumped so hard bro got lost in the cosmos
"A lot of them don't, but they don't have high expenses since the clubs are either amateur or semi professional. Relies a lot on outside support."
"Got it, will keep an eye out to see which unlucky lot are given Gateshead away on the Sat followed by a trip to Truro on Tuesday then "
"It starts at the board and Ancelotti has enabled it. It's way beyond just the players.

The club is distancing itself from the next generations of talents, who will grow up with Real as a pathetic, whiny club."
"> madrid the greatest club in the world have actually built a team of unlikeable twats

them being so big is precicely WHY the players are like that"
Think he’s more on about Wrexham being welsh
"Ah, understand that ambiguity, meant the league system rather than the league itself."
"Jude Bellingham acted the exact same in Dortmund. It’s actually kind of annoying how people think he’s changed. The difference is he played for an underdog of sorts at Dortmund, and is now at the most entitled club in the world."
There was a whole BILD piece on Jude at Dortmund and how the players/staff thought he was a bad influence on the team and were glad he left. Always been like this but Real now enable his behaviour.
"> but they are also the most entitled cunts you will find.

I feel like you can say this about basically every big club."
"No, it isn't good for the lower leagues, but it sounds more like you have an issue with hierarchies existing in general in football, not just privately or fan owned clubs. How would you solve the issue of some clubs being more attractive to play for than other clubs?  

>You don’t exactly have the perspective of clubs that spend most of their existence in the lower leagues.

Yes, I do, because my perspective is relative to leagues in Europe that are better than ours. We played against Tottenham in the Europa League with a squad where the vast majority of players have came up through our youth academy, in a city that's less the half the size of Hull. 

And the reward we got from that is that one of the best players in our team got bought by Plymouth, who are about to be relegated to League 1, because the worst teams in the Championship can offer 10 times higher wages than we can. I don't think this is an issue that needs to be solved, I think this is a perfectly normal part of football."
It's hard to take their opinion for granted when for every Pedri there's also them calling someone like Fermin the new Busquets after one decent game
something to do with fists and something to do with a longterm twerking for barca
"I actually get why Brighton fans hate Potter. He was allowed two seasons of pretty bad results and boring football before things started to get good, and then when they did, he fucked off to Chelsea. Also his 'history lesson' comment was so condescending."
That still means they lose out?
"Clubs would still lose money. Season tickets get de-valued since they don't cover European nights (in a general sense, clubs having packages for cup/European ties isn't unheard of) and raising ticket prices to cover the loss of matchday revenue would be exploitative (not to mention scalpers and getting UEFA to subsidise the difference isn't happening). Also asking fans to go to Bucharest or Istanbul on short-notice when plane/hotel tickets spike through the roof as soon as fixtures get announce would just be a shit time for all. Having one match of normality when you can take a quick drive to Old Trafford/San Siro and enjoy a game after work is what it should be about."
"Carlo's not here forever.

(Right?)"
Those arent real things
Just watch us lose against gateshead now
"regardless of what you think of the rules, the timing of the game should have 0 impact on fouls."
"Sorry, 15 points with 4 more games for the gap to widen. 

If it's close enough already there's no reason for the playoff. I'd rather have final day drama. It's just a pointless change."
">It gives both 17th, even if they are safe from dropping to 18th near the end of the season, something to play for because they can escape the play off by getting 16th, and gives 18-20th something to play for if they are all in close promixity as they could sneak 18th, instead of laying down and accepting relegation.

You see the vision! I think people are resistant because they hate change but they would grow to love it when they see the huge increase in drama"
"That logic absolutely does apply, but it's tradition and I guess it makes a bit more sense with 24 teams to give more teams something to play for."
"Play offs only work if there are enough teams so the only logical way a system like this would work would be if 3rd was X points ahead of 4th they get automatic promotion. Otherwise it seems needlessly convoluted.

The main point is that the systems work fine as they are and don't really need fixing."
"I don’t like that because it could encourage teams throwing matches to force the playoffs

If you were seventh and playing the team in fourth it’d be in your best interests to lose so that they close the gap"
It just seems needlessly complicated for something that works fine as is in my opinion.
"3 teams being relegated weeks in advance is a relatively new thing, we don't need to change the system because 3 really shit teams have come up the last two years, and one of those shit teams doesn't deserve to stay up because they fluked a playoff game against 17th."
fuck i did not think of that
I agree with you completely
"Do you mean a Welsh team playing in England? If so, that’s not what happened. Wrexham were over 100 years old when the Welsh league was formed. Similar story with the other Welsh clubs in the pyramid."
"Shouldnt be taken seriously. Its a way of appreciating the player

But when those appreciations stay the same for a long time, Then he must be that good"
"but he ain't getting to Barca with Olmo, Pedri there"
Less matches means players are better rested and therefore play better in important matches instead of getting tired or injured in an useless Cup match
"I hope he is, I don't want that fucker anywhere near Brazil's NT"
Oh yeah it's written in the stars. We're doomed to stay in this league forever
"Yes rewarding pathetic dives like Eric Garcia's is great for the game, that's what people want to watch 👍"
"Thoughts on the championship play offs then? Not a ""gotcha"" in any way, just want to know the similarity/ difference in reasoning"
"Yeah, that's what I mean, and lets be real, Welsh teams should play in the Welsh league."
"Feel like you are talking from the perspective of a top club here. Those cup matches definitely aren't useless to the likes of us, the income from them can be a massive help. Can't tell me you don't have academy players or rotation options who could use the game time?"
have they considered rotation
"I'd lose no sleep if they made 3rd automatic promotion instead, I just think changing them for the sake of changing them is pointless."

Did he emote by mistake 😭
"Could've pressed Pedri but emoted instead, that's on him."
Watching the game i thought pedri was unmarked because he's sprinting 🌚
No one tracking back. SMH. Too many egos in this team.
Rodrygo running as if he's on low battery.
Bro surprised his mega brain pass got read so easily lmao
Seeing the goal from this angle and watching Pedri the entire time makes it so much funnier
"He ran his socks off, but this situation is diabolical behavior. Could've pressed Pedri, could've tracked back, but chose to simply give up."
Lol. He could have made an impact on the pass to Yamal. Barca deserved win
"Maybe you should have tried to recover the ball, Jude instead of this BS"
"That's what happens when you just stand there like a moron. Some pressure from him and probably no goal, but let's emote instead lmao"
"He had a whole business day to try a put some pressure on the guy with the ball, instead he let him take all the time he needed to make the cross. I would bench Jude for that. Fucking spoiled divas. Real are such an embarrassing team its laughable"
Bro emoted instead of closing down Pedri 💀💀💀
Bro became a fan for a moment
"Not long ago he would have chased that ball down, clearly his ego/Real Madrid antics have had an effect his performance"
Posing for a youtube thumbnail
"""Oh no! Anyways"" aah blud"
Not good Jude. Not good. 
"I am a trainer at my son's football team. They are 6 yo. 

Amongst the many things we practice is losing the ball and not spending time regretting. We have this exercise where they shoot on goal and have to get back at the starting point as quick as they can. Its a simple exercise and they like it.

This guy can learn a thing or 2 from my 6 year old son."
"🎶 « Hey Jude, don't make it bad

Imagine tracking back and stopping Pedri from scoring instead of doing whatever the fuck he is doing.
“Everything 50/50 going their way.” Haha these babies don’t want to take responsibility for anything. And just cry
"number 8 had the whole field to himself for a bit lmao greatest 1-2 ever 

how are you letting this man make the long diagonal into your third and then letting the SAME guy jog to your box to stick it top corner uncontested"
https://i.imgur.com/McdnYEV.jpeg
I’m really starting to dislike this lad and that’s as an England fan. His attitude at times is shite. Needs a rocket up his ass and a reality check.
Aura defending from Bellingham.
basically Pedri went on Route One thanks to Belli and Rodrygo not defending
That's hilarious
"Maybe after losing the ball, he could try tracking back and help defend..
 Just a ideal."
I'm surprised Madrid fans didn't pelt him with rocks for that kind of behaviour.
Pedro passes from his own half then trots up unopposed to finish from just outside the box while Bellend has his hands on his head 😂👍👍
Dude went into spectate mode
What a story this angle tells holy shit. Appalling from Jude
cubarshi chants well deserved imo he was and has been incredible
Not the point of this video but man I fucking adore Cubarsí. Never in a million years I would've guessed he could play consistently at this level. What a center back.
"“Fuck off” - Bellingham, very likely"
"The ""Cu Cu Cubarsi, Cu Cu Cubarsi"" chant 🔥🔥🔥

The fans have been doing it often this season"
Bruh?? Jude is surely joking 🤡 he lost possession and the just stands still and lets Pedri under no press from him give a killer pass and then lets him run into open space and score and absolute banger! This angle shows how the first goal was all Jude’s fault.
He definitely thinks he's the star head in hands a yard away from a killer  pass an all he does is watch TAA is going to love that
This seems to sum up Real Madrids downfall pretty well. Bellingham to lazy to run back after an easy goal leads to an easy goal for Barca. I have seen some third Division games in germany recently and every player would have made the run back there.
"Leaves Pedri completely free to deal with that second ball, then doesn't track him so he can casually score a banger. Wtf"
"A lot of you won't like that, but Bellingham is overrated af"
Bellingham is so overrated
He’s a total head case
Nice to see the midfielders tracking back after losing possession 👍
lol what a shitshow it’s going to be if Trent goes there
Now do the Modric pass to Kounde
Why isn’t he running back ?!?!?
"He's just standing there, menacingly"
Pedri i love that guy 🤌💥
Why did he just stand still? Think his ego is starting to get the better of him
"His fault, not the bad pass, but the attitude and lazyness, bloody hell. You missplaced a pass, so press the person, chase the ball, dont stand there like a lemon!"
"Then he fucking complains to Vini because Vini does the same shit. I swear we have some fucking drama queens in the club. Vini, Rudiger, and Jude can’t stop complaining and acting like idiots every game and I’m tired of it."
Talk about deserving to loose..rodrygo and Bellingham just let the Barca player walk the pitch to score.
This is why this guy should always play as the most advanced midfielder. Too much ego to track back :(
"This is why Jude is Trent's best friend. Same exact attitude.

  
Best in the world at going forward, while actually not too bad defensively. But looked bad defensively because sometimes they just didn't want to run back to defend after losing possession."
"Wtf are the «o, o» sounds"
He could've run back intercepted their pass but I think being a star is a curse.
This vs. Wolverhampton team defense on a 3-0 lead.
I really hope England doesn't rely on him in international tournaments.
I‘m entitled to get that pass through! Why you dare to stop it! - Jude
Lol. You can bet he earned some serious criticism from the videoanalysis team post match.
"Obviously this is a player problem but this also comes from the manager.

Any modern manager would have changed this mentality earlier"
I always found him overrated as a Dortmund fan
Well good luck to the next coach trying to get this madhouse under control
what a good time to be a Madrid hater
At least he managed to walk calmly down to get a better view of that goal.
World class workrate from RM there
mikel would be so mad at that
When people do this at 5 aside then the person who intercepted walks causally past them as they make no attempt to reclaim the ball has to be one of the most annoying things a player can do
"Presence of mind from pedri and jogging before even ball reaches Yamal. It's like he was expecting something. And real Madrid players were clueless in midfield.

The way rodrygo jogging behind him sums up Madrid this season. Of course their ass got beaten by Barca so many times."
Who is going to follow Pedri lads?
I saw a few comments in the other thread try to defend Bellingham by blaming Ceballos. What are they smoking and why protect Bellingham by throwing his teammate under the bus. Is he that precious?
I assume the goal scorer was supposed to be covered by Bellingham. He is starting to act like a real douche
that gave me Pogba vibe
Man literally just stopped lol
"Dont care if its a kick about in the park or top level, someone loses the ball like that I expect more effort from them to win it back."
"Always gets me seeing players react like this 😆

Dude, put your hands on your head after they score. The first thing he should be doing is trying to chase that ball down again

There's three seconds of reaction after he just gives it away and then he's just walking back."
actually time to work back as well. not even an attempt
Bluetooth defending lmao
"""Can’t believe the opponent blocked my pass"" looking mf, what the fuck is that reaction lmao?"
Madrid fans are actually arguing that Bellingham is better than Pedri. He can't even keep up with Pedri jogging lol
Bellingham seems like a bit of a cunt.
"I got banned from the Madrid sub for saying that Mbappe would destroy the successful team that Ancelotti had built, and yet that is exactly what happened. Madrid fans are so entitled that they cannot accept even a little bit of truth. It's sad really, before Mbappe came i they were a good team, and buying the right players for the right positions would have made them unbeatable. People don't want to face the fact that Mbappe not only destabilizes the team, he is also a quietly toxic character."
Most overrated player in world football
yep. he's a good player but still gets too much into his own head.
Ron Atkinson has a phrase for that.
"For England's sake, get him out of there. Or hope he gets a manager that will make him a complete player. Such an immense talent. It will be such a waste if all that talent is squandered because of a crappy attitude that isn't fixed. Cristiano was also a whiny shit but SAF ensured he got his football right first before he got to the whining part of his game."
Jude needs to wind his neck in
Guess he thought he was bowling and didn't make a strike.
"""midfielder"" not tracking his man and staying up...🤔"
Nice of to stop and watch it all happen
Where is midfielder?
TIL of the word emote
Doesnt even run back to defend hahahha
Unbelievable actually
he's so brainless
"“It didn’t work!” 🤷

*switch off*"
"People saying why madrid players arent tracking back/pressing? Surely its because they were exhausted at this point, no?"
Not been impressed with his recent performances at all. Far too often see him walking around like he's Messi. Hopefully it isn't a health/fitness thing and he can snap out of it
Pedri went for a walk in the park. Never disturbed.
Didn't even track back... Just stood their and let Pedri score a worldie lmao
chud gaye guru
"Yeah stand there planted to the spot, dumbass"
Cubarsi was insane he stopped so many chances from vini getting a 1v1 with the keeper
What is he doing? I would be so annoyed if I a real fan
He blamed that on the ref propably.
"Fuck me, what a lazy guy."
Real Dramadrid
I’m not a professional footballer but I don’t think you’re supposed to just stand there.
"The pass is fine, walking back is the shocker. The goal scorer jogs right by him"
"Lol, embarrassing."
"Bad pass

Emote 

Don’t run back

Concede Goal


Earn 11,88€ while doing that"
"""Ballon d'or level player"""
Pedri shows him how its done
"Primadonnas, the lot of them."
My guy emoted on accident
"This was so bad on so many levels lol. Pedri aint even trying, hes not sprinting or whatever ... but still nobody can catch him lol."
"I will never understand professional players that don’t respect their defensive assignments, no awareness, I don’t care if you’re tired, there’s a man open and you just let him be"
People talking about Bellingham but the hell is Rodrygo doing 😂
Go and try to stop the player. What are you emoting?
Bellingham mains spider man
"As much as I like Bellingham, he has to track back after gets intercepted. Our front 3 in the first half were abysmal"
This man makes more in a a couple days than you do in a year and couldn't be bothered to even jog back.
why is this so funny
Got to stay still for all the cameras
Might not have led to a goal if he actually pressed and attempted to win it back instead of giving the player all the time in the world to play a pass.
People try to say this guy is better than musiala and wirtz
"If he would have kept pressuring the passer after his missed pass, then there might not have been such a productive counter"
Over rated player. Should have immediately tracked back and marked that runner who ultimately scored
That is outrageous 😭
Did he see the future? Haha
"Defend ❌
Emote ✅"
Good hustle jude
"did all rm players pledge to give nothing in this game? they look so unserious, not even pressing or chasing the ball"
Both him and Rodrygo are just spectating instead of playing 😂
"All this team has this season is tantrum ,  weird reaction and big ego with useless anger than actual talent to show for it"
So upset that he stopped playing
You mean him walking after the interception? That’s about the most appropriate response from an AM.
Cracking finish. What a player!
Should have tucked his shirt in more
180mil heh?
"He's absolutely up his own bum hole. I can't believe how much of a horrible, self-centred person he is. He thinks hes the main character. It's a team game, get over yourself you toad."
A lot to say about Madrid’s lack of press here but Cubarsi had like 5 interceptions exactly like this one in the game. Dude is incredible. His ability to pick out the pass and intercept it is insane for someone so young.
I see the surrender cobra has crossed the pond
Great reaction. Should do it again.
One of the situations that went 50/50^^
That lad is the biggest asshole
„Whats the worst that could happen if I just stand still“
Bellingoooohnooo
"Oh, I didn't even notice that Pedri ended up scoring after making that initial pass. That makes it even worse. Lol. Ancelotti must have been fuming."
main chacarter syndrome
That was a terrible pass attempt
Is there a yt link to this video?
"Wtf is he doing just standing there?

I'm not sure if I've ever seen a more disconnected real madrid in the last 20 years or so."
Prick couldn't even be bothered to track his man. Ha! Good!
Rumour has it he's still walking back to the defense
How do we show this to Tuchel so he stops thinking Jude is the one to build the team around
"That's just so infuriating to watch! Gave the ball away, no tracking back, literally walking! That's exactly what you should NOT do after losing the ball."
Bruh that’s one of the worst things I’ve seen. I’d be fuming as a Madrid fan/colleague.
Como é bom ver outra geração de galáticos se lascar.
"The ultimate luxury player. He's mastered the art of looking busy, like that 1 coworker we all have who's not really doing anything bust skillfully mastered the art, so they never get caught or called out for it."
"Lmao 

KMC would never.. and so much for giving starting chance to Rodrygo.

The entitlement is unreal.. I don't remember my team not playing their 100% .. do these kids think victory just falls into their bags? 

We definitely need a CM, LB, RB, CB and a manager who is changes players based on form and values work rate 

I don't think they have learnt their lesson even after getting spanked 5 goals last time.. they will yet again get beat in the league matches 

And needed to be said, full credit to barca players and Hansi .. the coach has charged everything at barca.. such a massive change"
"Bellingham should take a lesson from R9 in WC Final 2002.

R9 at highest stakes tried to recover the ball and it results in the 1st goal of that final. 

R9 didn't have any defensive assignments. He's not even a midfielder."
Really good pressing by bellingham. He gave it all on the pitch yesterday
"Pedri just casually jogging into acres of space at the top of the box is absolutely criminal at a Sunday league level, let alone 30 minutes into a fucking top division cup final"
"I'm not even a football manager and that made me absolutely livid, I can't imagine how Ancelotti must've felt"
What don't they want to defend ? It's Barcelona smh. Too casual. No wonder Arsenal beat them. Can't play like that in EPL.
He was the one supposed to cover Pedri too lol. He was more concerned about doing the meme that playing atm
Not a good look for los blancos
u/savevideo
"PoV of when you get used to playing against semi amateurs and don't need to work hard for 90mins.

Imagine doing that in the PL... He'd get blasted day one."
He's gotten into the lazy RM mentality. The someone else can do it mindset
"Great player, terrible attitude"
"What a lazy cunt , he could have tracked Pedri but know it’s about me"
Rice >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Jude is a shit footballer. Such a passenger
"I think we can give him an assist for this. It was such a good pass, the defender was lucky in stopping it. Everything that happened after that is on the rest of the team. My baby Jude did nothing wrong here!


This is such a perfect clip 👌 chefs kiss 👌"
Lazy player but good on the ball
"As great a player Bellingham is, I am now beginning to think I want him NOWHERE near the England team. It's not worth upsetting the atmosphere across the players because he's unable to check his ego, and clearly thinks he's the main man in the squad."
Are there a lot of jokes about how close cule is to rectal opening (i think culo)? Is that a common theme on the Iberian?
"You can tell how good Jude is by how much attention this mistake gets, his highlight reel from this game showed how hard he worked, this was a mistake though"
I feel like they had more than enough players back to maybe not triple defend a winger while leaving the top of the box empty.  Pretty difficult to place much blame on Bellingham here
"After this, Jude was a different beast and arguably player of the match.

But frustrating to see nonetheless."
The kid needs to lose some weight. He thinks he’s a bodybuilder not a footballer
Wasn’t even a good pass the slide wasn’t necessary to intercept that
"even if he didnt press Pedri, he could have at least tracked Pedris run to prevent the goal. It's so bad all round"
Just being there is 90% of the task
"Yeah, even if you don't make it in time, you can force a rushed pass that might not be as accurate."
"What’s crazy is how many opportunities Bellingham has to get back into defensive mindset - as the buildup is so long before the goal is scored - and he decides not to every time.  

Clearly his man just having an uncontested jog to wide open space in front of the net."
"https://youtu.be/DUir_SwfMGs?si=sjwC9Utw_xJmADhd

He did the LeBron scream"
"What a save!

What a save!

What a save!

What a save!

What a save!"
Misclicked 💀
Blud hasn't learned how to cancel animation yet
Jude.exe has stopped working
Cubarsi’s interception left him shook
Should have cancelled it with a roll.
he should have just t posed and made out like he was in an animation lock
"That's exactly what came to my mind as well, he's just what, a few yards away?! Go on and retrieve the fuckin ball you moron."
Guy stood still like defending or wining back the ball were foreign concepts to him.
Must've learn from his other superstar teammates
Why would the referee do this?
"Even after emoting, he still have time to catch up with Pedri but decided to take a nice stroll 🚶‍♂️."
Me when I go down one goal and restart the match
Always hate games where emotes are uncancellable.
Rodrigo was not much better. Strolling behind pedri without a care in the world
"Was gonna say. The goal isn't entirely to blame on Bellingham (Yamal has so much space in the box he could lay out a picnic blanket), but Pedri had plenty of time to pick out that pass because Bellingham wanted to emote rather than press. I've seen him do that a few times for England too."
"In this case yes it looks bad, but overall Bellingham is the hardest working player they have and hard to beat in a duel, can't really blame him for taking a breather every now and then."
He actually does this often. Gives it away and moans at others or starts a press when his team isn't set to press yet then gets popped around and throws his hands up which results in his team being down a man in defensive shape.
Or maybe the football gods were the one doing the emote
Or tracked him lol. 
Man jogged there just to score a banger lmao
"Nah, RM is tracking back like it is a pick up game."
They literally became PSG
At least Trent is exceptional a defending
The only players I like in this current team are Fede and Modric.
"There's no way Alonso can get a tune out of this team, not if Perez continues his policy of not spending enough on defenders. This feels like the psg team of a few seasons ago. With Flick at barca, will Alonso survive a season without any trophy?"
"Trent probably saw this and thought: “That there, I’d fit right in there like a glove”."
Honestly one of the few times Jude got caught ball watching. I get tired watching him lol
"Ancelloti should put looping clips of this sort of thing on every screen inside the club. Anyone who whines about refs has to watch and commentate on what they’re seeing for 5 mins. What a lazy, entitled, toxic group of players."
Don't worry. Trent will be there to cover it next season... (just a joke. Trent's defending has improved by a lot)
Wait until you add trent haha
"I mean yes Belli could've done more, but by the time Pedri hits the ball there's 7 Real players plus Courtois in the box with only 3 Barca forwards there. They had more than enough numbers track back to cover the goal and Vini/Rodrygo are basically told not to track too far back to be ready for fast counters."
"I can’t remember where I read it, but the Dortmund players were getting tired of Jude towards the end of his stay there. By all accounts his ego was getting to him, he’d regularly wait for the team to leave the pitch then do his own lap of honour clapping the fans, things like that."
"No no no, it’s the referee who is wrong /s"
Coaching issue if I’ve ever seen one. You think these 20-25 year olds would get away with this for flick/pep/slot?
he did the entire match
i didn't even know he was playing until they subbed him off
I think not enough is said about the fact Rodrygo got pocketed by GERARD MARTIN for an entire half.
I mean he probably is tbh.
He is me when I’m trying to run in my dreams
Which is still more than Bellingham did
Is he injured? He’s been a shadow of his former self!
He had such a good start to the season but it's the same thing again. Bro plays well for a couple of weeks then disappears for the next 3 months.
Lol.  Did even realize he was playing.
It was a 50/50 situation and the ref just let it go Barca’s way! Scandalous
The way he just casually jogs into an acre of unmarked space.
The highest velocity Pedri reached in this sequence is *after* he scored lmfaoooo
That too in the 27th minute in a final. Shocking.
Looks like even Pedri was surprised that he had so much time and space there
"He literally just let Pedri jog past him. Not tracking your runner, who is barely  even running, is absolute shocking"
We’re all Pedri fans. <3
Can we even blame him? Pedri is phenomenal.
"I was gonna say, I’m used to seeing him running too much if anything"
That's gonna get him alot more money than winning a cup ngl /s
"The beatens, perfect!!"
"Shades of Messi's 500th goal on the Bernabeu (the one where he held his shirt after), only none of Real even tried to track back or put pressure  this time 😂 

And also that goal was at the end of the match, everyone knackered, here it's 27th minite and Real's mids and forwards can't be bothered to move."
Neymar was quite decent.
Couto had some decent moments for once
"Nah, Ronald Araujo played well."
"Pretty sure this moment is exactly why he said that, to play down his responsibility"
Yea number 5 messed up big time
You get battered everywhereeee you go
That number 8 is going places! Who he?
He's nowhere near as good as he thinks he is. A shitty teammate and petulant af. Strong rumors that most in the England camp don't like him.
But did he say it respectfully?
"He is very good player, but his shitty mental takes over"
"He is among top 2 most hardworking players in the club, besides Valverde. This instance is an outlier, not the rule."
Go to FotMob and compare other midfielders' defensive work to Bellingham's — you’ll see he is among the top players in defensive work too(and yes even better than pedri in this stat). Isolating one incident and making statements like this is exactly why I hate clip-watcher football.
"His main problem is that he's among the worst with dealing with players running at him, if you look at most defensive backs they're just a different build. I mean he's faced some top players and kept them quiet while playing his game, gutted if he leaves."
"""Cu, cu, Cubarsi!"""
It seems Carlo Ancelotti's vibes haven't been giving of late.
Mbappe was the only ly good attacking player yesterday and the whole season lol
">Or hope he gets a manager that will make him a complete player

He is one of the most complete-top player around, what are you talking about? 

And while his attitude has caused problems like diving (pretty standard), and arguments with ref, his attitude barely has any negative effects on his playstyle, he has been running his ass off this whole season despite playing Euros in summer and carrying a shoulder injury since 2023."
It was the 28th minute. If you're already exhausted by that point there's other issues to talk about
"The how dare you not let get my own way mentality.

Entitled."
We're called cules/culers because of that actually. Passersby would see the butts of fans sitting on the walls of the stadium so the term was adopted by the fanbase and we've been called that ever since.
"He was probably RM's best player last night... although he made a few mistakes, it doesn't take away from how he plays..."
">arguably player of the match.

Jesus Christ"
"No way, Koundé was the only shinning stone in the mud that the match became, Madrid had three good players but for me Fede was the best"
Awesome Limewire avatar btw
Bellingham gives me Tatum vibes all the time
Chat disabled for 3 seconds.
Great Pass!
Beautiful car btw
You get battered everywhereeeeeeeee you go
"No button mash, amateur stuff."
"Looked like Pedro hesitated in confusion too lol like ""Isn't this guy supposed to be defending me why do I have this much room?"" before deciding to pass

Edit: Pedri oops. Autocorrect"
Nah he counter expressed.
And then while Yamal was heading toward goal this guy was hardly even jogging back to the box.
TAA should fit right in
"Fun fact: mbappe and vinicius are the top 2 players in La Liga this season who have spent the most time walking (as per stats from La Liga TV this week, and excluding keepers obviously)"
"Reminds me of that Rooney goal where he's jogging, arguing with the referee and then scores a banger out of nowhere"
Wasn’t Bellingham also the one who should guard Pedri? So he completely loses himself in disappointment after the intercepted pass and forgets that his man on his way to score a goal. Love it!
The old PSG
"Credit where it's due, a few months of having Mbappe at the club and they've dissolved into a toxic  cesspool of divas with spoiled single child dissorder. Say what you want about the guy, but none of us can question his impact on a team"
"To be fair Messi was 34/35, Neymar did some tracking back and Mbappe was the 9 which gets a bit of a pass for not defending much. Meanwhile none of these guys have touched 27 yet."
He is not so bad but he needs support. RM def mid will have to baby sit his side so Trent can go up
But his Hollywood passes that comes off once every 3 times!! Imagine!! /s
It would be like a career suicide if he still decides to join them after all the meltdowns and clown shows this year. If it’s for the money he should look for offer from Saudi Arabia.
Now is the time to bring Theo back and make the ultimate no defence just vibes team
The unc must run for the youngster ffs...
Fede was looking like a cheat code in the extra time. How this man is still able to sprint everywhere after 100+ minutes is crazy. What an engine he has.
"No, Alonso will get flayed by the Madrid fans and spoil his own legacy. Madrid has a history of treating its ex Galacticos poorly. Remember Casillas' exit? And while Zidane had an aura that made these big egos respect him unconditionally, Alonso, while being a legend, does not have the Zidane level super Galactico aura that Zidane had. It's going to be a rebuild phase for Madrid, and things are going t get ugly."
"It would be an awful move for Xabi.

The dressing room has too many toxic ego's and some of them don't have the quality to back it up. The club isn't in a good place. If he wants the Madrid job he should wait until they sort themselves out.

Things could get ugly for him very quickly there and the Madrid fans won't have his back. They will be calling for his head by November if the results aren't good enough. He should stay at Leverkusen, he's 43 so he has plenty of time to take the Madrid job later."
"He did a few times in the first half, but he did pick up a lot in the second half."
Entire half*
i saw some madrid fans calling him shit and only then i realized he was playing
Neither did he
Nor surprising tbh. Gerard Martin has the blood of Steven Gerard running through him after all
"Well, he is living his dreams."
While it was still 0-0
"He goes to kinda square up, realizes it’s not coming and is like fuck it and looks up. Definitely surprised lol"
You get battered everywhereeeee you go
"Im still traumatized with the disasterclass he put vs Vini when he was still on Girona, one of the worst performances i have seen"
He Uruguayan
"haha, good save."
"Man Valverde has 3 sets of lungs, the man was everywhere today. "
then why’s he doing it in a final? pathetic
"Yes that’s Not the legitimate criticism. But me personally can’t stand the artificial show he’s trying to make on the field all the time and that is another clear instance of that. 

He is a great player. But just way too much of a showman that is very much in love with himself.

Compare him to valverde if you’re at it. Have never seen valverde putting a show and that makes him levels more classy than Bellingham imo."
"He's a good defensive 10, not an 8 or a 6"
"Yeah he's been great for Madrid since arrival, couple brainfarts here and there but most of em go unnoticed cuz they keep winning..."
Save the outlier for a game against Castellon then not the cup final
"Maybe I'm wrong, but aren't his stats on FotMob in comparison with other attacking midfielders?

So not including CMs and DMs?"
"While sometimes that happened, that's far from being the big problem. More often than not, he's just not there."
"The presence of a player can make their teammates worse. Look at Ronaldo United return. They scored way less goals compared to the previous season, after he joined, despite having decent numbers himself. That's literally what has happened with Madrid."
"> he has been running his ass off this whole season 

Only seen two of his games this year but in neither match against Arsenal did he run his ass off"
If that had happen in latinoamerica they would have been the Culones.
Generally good at everything but pretty bland on and off the field?
This is Rocket league!
The most hilarious part of it
Barcelona legend Pedro still playing in 2025
TAA has never done it this blatantly lol
Sadly true.
"At the same kid Yamal is tracking back like idiot, including stripping Vini from ball few times."
They might still be in top 10 If you include keepers as well
"At their time together in PSG, Messi was pressing more than Mbappe"
"Not just arguing. He is completely livid, keeps shouting at the ref, and gets the ball in front of him more or less by accident and just cunts it away, clearly just lashes at the ball in anger. Top corner from 25 yards out. Brilliant. He’s not even celebrating a world class goal afterwards, he is still very mad. 

https://youtu.be/pPHqRpJ7tLY?si=W_7a-V39ZoFe-Tls"
reminds me of the berbatov and nani goal
My thoughts too. You just let a world class midfielder stroll past you on a ball you lost.
"While the new PSG is becoming like old Madrid.

It's fascinating to see."
"PSG: Porn, Streets and Gays…"
Correlation does not imply causation
The fuck does mbappe have to do with this? You think this team hasn’t always been that way?
Hey don’t drag us single children into this
Lol he was their best player last night.
Who would have thought *Insert shocked Pikachu*
Bellend has been like this since Dortmund. Insufferable 
"As if Rüdiger was a chill guy before.

Kroos left, Carvajal, Militao and Mendy are out due to injury. Vini and Rodrygo are out of form. Kylian changes the balance but Madrid would look way different if they would have a proper back four and creativity and calmness in midfield."
That old aged Messi did more tracking back for PSG than Mbappe did
That’s gonna leave some big holes in midfield that any team with a decent midfields and wingers will feast
I hope he doesn’t join. Fede will just track back for him while he inverts to the midfield.
"Even Liverpool does this less now. It's ibou being a baller that covers him. In the past, watch every time trent gets attacked, hendo is there. Every time.

Nowadays Szobo might track back and he does, but ibou usually covers it"
He is bad. He occasionally have a game where he looks solid but it's more of an outlier than the norm. And I'm saying this as someone who watches almost every Liverpool game. He's just bad. Bradley is much better defensively not to even mention Gomez.
We have 2 defendee who is a stud and amazing they can cover for 3 people at times.
"no need to /s, those passes will be good, its just that clean sheets will be harder to come by"
Liverpool fans are so bitter lol
Trent is probably watching this video thinking he'll fit right in. Attempting a long ambitious ball and not tracking back is his DNA.
"This sub is so reactionary. ""Career suicide"" is such an exaggeration as if Real Madrid weren't the current CL champions."
You say this like clown shows and egos haven't been a constant in the Madrid CL dominance
"Jfc... one bad season and it's all doom and gloom! Madrid had worse seasons back in 2018-2019, had a season with just 68 points! Less than 1.8 ppg. They survived and won 2 CLs since then."
"It's astonishing at the levels of talent they do have, yet I can't disagree with 'rebuild phase'.."
"Gerard pique, world class CB was right there 😭


Plus he was our ex, instead of L*******l schwein"
I guess he works better under pressure. Or something along that line
"Yeah, but his mom is brazilian so by brazilian law is really easy to get citizenship."
"My point was about ""too much ego to track back"". His ego isn't an issue for tracking back, he does that quite a lot."
Yes that's why I mentioned compare him with pedri's defensive work
Idk Manchester United were shit in general and he was the one that always saved them .
"No, a team doesn't become worse by having the all-time goalscorer as a striker, who also saved them in many matches and was their player of the season. 

I've never seen the player performing being blamed for underperformance of the team. This is the first and only time I've seen it with Ronaldo. 

Reminds me of an ESPN headline, something along the lines of ""Are Ronaldo's goals actually a problem for United?"". Peak of football analysis. 

As preliminary - yeah, we know Ronaldo sucks the confidence out of everyone around him; makes them worse players; makes tactical excellence impossible for the coach and so on silly takes of his villain power that he exudes and feeds off of the weakness of others, which he himself caused in the first place. 

Ole Gunnar cannot come up with a tactic including one of the best, if not the best, goalscorers in history and that's Ronaldo's fault. EtH also. It's not that they are inadequate as coaches and cannot manage and coach outside their one trick pony and one dimensional idealistic tactic, it's that Ronaldo is a villain."
6 goals in Serie A this year still
"Transfer 1 Pedro, 5 Pedros will take its place"
Tbf Pedro is his real name
"Indeed, 6 league goals for Lazio this seasono"
"Yamal has a crazy work ethic at 17 man, this kid plays 90 minutes every game and can't be rested most of the times because we don't have many backup wingers."
A Brexit goal if I ever saw one.
"Here's a higher-quality video of the above, although I think it's only viewable in the UK and Ireland (thanks Sky Sports -_-) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrTVQZfZsjQ"
"That's crazy. In lots of sports, you lose a super star like that, you're toast. I guess it was addition by subtraction. Was Mbappé was a cancer? I don't follow football like that."
Could the Mbappé touch just be a thing?
mbappe effect
"Oh, it implies. Doesn't prove it, but the implication is there."
"It's funny we see Bellingham and Vini Jr watch Pedri take all the space in midfield and score, and somehow people blame Mbappe for it, lol."
"Maybe what he has to do with it is that his arrival completely threw off the balance of a team that won the league and CL last year without him and looked absolutely invincible against any opposition they faced. His arrival is the reason, indirect or not, for all the frustration and complaining you're seeing from the players that carried Madrid to their success last year."
"In the past they were able to pull themselves together when it mattered

Their winning core is gone, now they are left with the accessories"
"not really, liverpool managed, RM will manage too."
"Yeh, Liverpool only won the PL twice, the champs league (and another 2 finals), FA cup, league cup, club World Cup, super cup. 

Lots of decent teams feasting there"
hey i know just the team for that
Current CL champions humiliated by arsenal and no longer in it
"It all depends on who's gonna replace Ancelotti. Cause there are not many coaches who can manage big egos like he does (or atleast did). Xabi Alonso might be able to do it if he leaves Leverkusen, or maybe Raul as a ""new Zidane"". Klopp might work for a season or 2 max, but I don't see Madrid starlets buying into hard work, counter pressing & constant running for longer than that. Wouldn't be surprised if the dressing room implodes somewhen in the 2nd year, making Klopp leave and forcing Perez to call Zidane to help save the season,"
"Career suicide is a completely nonsense phrase. What does it even mean?

Maybe it makes sense for someone playing in the Championship who pushes for a move hoping to get picked up by an EPL team and ends up playing out the rest of their career in the A League or MLS or whatever. But even if Trent Alexander-Arnold ends up playing for Real Madrid's banter era team, he's still going to be earning ridiculous amounts of money for a top flight team.

But if someone takes ""career suicide"" to mean something like ""destroys your reputation"", leaving Liverpool for *anyone* is going to do that to TAA (at least, until everyone's decided his legs are gone). He's never going to be seen as the same player ever again. That's something I think he's already made his peace with. But the nature of the reinterpretation will change if RM enter a banter era because the English press will attribute RM's banter-ness to TAA's inability to defend, which is the existing narrative about him."
"They mean it in the sense that he’ll only add to the liability in press and defense. If he decides to go, he’ll probably be one of the first ones to be replaced off the pitch if they start collapsing defensively "
Tbh I don’t pay much attention to Madrid outside of our games against them in the Champions League.
Lol u right. Next time!
He's Uruguayan until he is Brazilian
Didnt know that
Yeah bro maybe he just forgot instead
"Thats the thing though. The team may not have needed his ""saving"" if he wasn't on the field. They could have probably just played team ball and won those games outright.

Looking at Madrid, its the same thing. Literally all their forwards have worse stats than last Season when they lost only two games all Season(both against ATL)."
"Football is a team game. And if you've actually played ball on any level before, you'd know that its very possible for great player's presence to affect the rest of his teammates. For example, Vini went from being someone that worked hard and pressed at least on an average level, to basically not doing that anymore. What do you think happened? And what about not having a focal point in the middle to cross to, instead of having a player that shares the same space in the field as him."
Really reminds me of Messi’s frantic pressing when he still had long hair
Most 17 year olds should have a crazy work ethic that's when you'll have most of your energy and need less time for recovery.
I don't mind if he makes himself look a fool with his friend Raphinha if it means he's learning Raphinhas work rate and work ethic.
And barca should be doing everything they can to protect him instead of running him to the ground like this. I swear it will bite them in the ass in the future.
Rooney was a hell of a talent. If only he did t want to shag nans & eat kebabs he could have been running it with Messi & Ronaldo.
"It all depends on the balance.

Mbappe can do bits if you build around him. PSG were forced to rethink, and they made it work

Conversely, Real filled their team with players to build around, but you can’t build a skyscraper without a foundation. They’re all yang, no yin."
You need a balanced team when you have multiple players who don’t want todo defensive work it’s just not going to work out
"PSG started to rebuild the whole team before Mbappe left, they got their young players and did good recruitment, they spent like 3 years to get to the level they are now, it's a 180 from the takeover time"
"PSG are much more balanced now, the previous 2-3 superstars never pressed, the whole team strategy was built around them, they never led by example unlike say Ronaldo at Madrid, and they and other important players (Veratti) had too many injuries which is mad given how few league games mattered compared to other big UCL clubs. Their recruitment has since sought younger hungrier players rather than established stars which has rebalanced the squad and brought a level of intensity they rarely mustered in the previous era"
"I won't say no, because of the implication."
">but the implication is there.

Are you gonna hurt these players??"
"Depends on semantics. From a first-order logic point of view, it definitely does not imply.  In a more broad, common way of talking, I guess you could argue that it does (although I still find it very debatable and weak)"
The video shows Bellingham and Rodrygo not tracking back. No blame on Mbappe or Vini here.
I actually think Vini's ego is a much bigger problem for Madrid and Mbappe is much more willing to work for the team.
"It’s not Mbappe himself IMO but his signing marked a return to Perez desiring a big name over a functioning team. It’s Beckham 2.0 in terms of disrupting a successful side by signing an unnecessary player. Mbappe is Beckham and Vini is Figo.

The impact of carrying extra players in terms of workload is huge throughout a team too and can lead to others going half arsed."
"This is kinda short selling it, imo. Their defense was a shambles for a while, even before Mbappoe arrived. They do all have that diva personality about them though, which just complicated their defensive woes, like we see in this clip. The least the rest of the team could do is work together and be unselfish, to help out their already severely lacking back line, but instead they all have main character syndrome"
"you cant be fucking serious lmao, looked invincible against leipzig, bayern last year? jesus"
"That’s cause the old guard has left for the most part, not because of mbappe lmao"
Liverpool’s press is miles ahead of Real Madrid. Most of the Madrid players just half heartedly jog towards whoever has the ball with no real plan in mind
"I dont see Mbappe, Vini and rodrygo pressing like salah Firminio and Mane"
They don’t exact press as effectively 
"We managed due to having a manager who lost his shit if every single person on the team was not running their asses off.

You really think Klopp would be fine with what Bellingham did in this gif?"
"Liverpool had a workhorse midfield covering for the fullbacks though, Madrid don’t have that, think that’s the point being made"
"Raúl and Xabi Alonso are absolute uncertainties on that matter because they've never trained a team as full of divas, semi-divas and diva wannabes as this one."
"Klopp isn’t going to Real.

But if he did, I don’t think many of the current squad would be there much longer."
"Trent is built for Alonso's system. He‘s like a right-footed, better version of Grimaldo. He'll be fine."
"So why did you say it would be career suicide to join then, if you don’t know anything more about them than watching a couple of games over a few years?

You seriously don’t know anything about Real Madrid, despite posting regularly on this subreddit, that is always full of news about them?

Why are you just making stupid stuff up?"
"If he can't make up his mind and feels both,would he be like Uruzilian?"
But that didn't happen for Ronaldo at real Madrid even though everyone was making the pass for him to finish
"Yes, it is, but you don't make an analysis of the team. You're the one making it seem like the game is just about one guy on the pitch, hence he causes all the good and the bad things. 

Ronaldo did his fair share of link up play, scoring and driving the team to a winning mentality. For some reason, you say it is a team game, but you never analyze what the other 10 on the pitch, besides Ronaldo, are doing; what the coach is doing and what the opponent team and coach are doing. 

Your entire analysis is ""Ronaldo come, results drop, Ronaldo bad and cause for bad results."" When we say that he actually performed and won quite some matches for his team ""but Ronaldo still bad, because if it not for him, they'd be doing better"". So, in every case, it's always Ronaldo's fault. If he performs, or not, you've crafted in your mind this narrative of him causing all the problems. 

And then be like ""fOoTbAll iS A teAM gAMe!"", yet you never analyze the team and have this unhealthy obsession and fixation on Ronaldo."
Whose nan did he shag
So these clubs are in danger?
Why would I ever hurt these players? I'm not gonna hurt these players!
Ohyeah that's Rodrygo not Vini JR lol.. now I did it myself.
"The teams they beat over two legs in the CL? They lost 2 matches the entire season, both to Atletico. No matter how bad they played, they came back in the dying minutes time and time again."
"How good was Barcelona's press a year ago compared to now?

New manager can change everything."
"They also have the likes of camavinga, valverde, tchouameni. Bellingham has a history of working pretty hard. I’m sure we can go back and find a individual moment of Curtis jones not tracking back well

To add Klopp also desperately wanted Bellingham. He must have thought he could do the job"
"Valverde, camavinga and Tchouameni?"
"For Alonso, Florentino will need to swallow his pride and let Xabi have a significant say in transfers since he will obviously need specific profiles for his system."
Yeah Klopp only wants players with asthma
"To play Alonso's tactic effectively (ie winning thanks to tactic aproach not just due to superior talent) Madrid would need to replace like half the squad, To cover Trent's defensive liability he needs to play either as a wingback in 3 atb system, or like in Klopp's best LFC seasons being insured by work horse midfielders (Fabinho,Henderson etc)."
"Dude are you blind about the attitude showed by the club overall? Whining about every decision about the match even before the game start? Being the most entitled bullies in the world of football who at the same time play the victim card every time they loose.

In addition given the history of Liverpool and Real in the CL and the attitude of Real fans towards their players, I can bet that TAA would be sorry in a few years if he joins them."
Because Benzema sacrificed.
"* Jude Bellingham Side eyes from behind *

Well, you certainly wouldn't be in any danger!"
It was actually quite good lol. Not at this level obviously because of the injuries but it was still far beyond anything Real Madrid are doing
"Why would he do that for Alonso, when he didn't do it for Zidane?"
Dead banter mate. Enjoy 2nd 😘
a WHOPPING 1 match ban
"Rudiger seems like  massive piece of shit, only got worse since he's gone to Madrid."
3 match ban for Lewandowski and a 10 second time penalty for Esteban Ocon then
Watching Rudiger losing it was my favorite moment of the match.
Remember that time he was bullying and slapping a staff member and literally nothing happened?
"Throw the book at him.

I cannot be the only one who is heartily sick of the Blancos antics of late.   
  
I wish they would follow through on some of their threats to boycott, so the rest of the world that just wants to play ball can get on with things in peace. No one gets to win all the time."
"There is a translation error, Fehlgeburt would be miscarriage.

""Missgeburt"" is more a heavy insult meaning ""Freak""/""Bastard""

The words are considered heavy insults in German."
"Damn, you’d think ref missed several penalties and a red card with that reaction"
what a complete disgrace of a human being
This guy is one of the worst people in football and that’s saying something
A complete and utter nutcase.
This guy is deffo on some crazy drugs. He behaves like a complete lunatic on the field sometimes.
"This is Spain, don't expect a heavy sanction."
"1 match ban offence. However, had he touched his nose instead…"
Spanish FA: Best I can do is 1 match ban to allow him to play in next classico in 2 weeks.
Dude has some major anger issues.
If this doesn’t result in a 6 months plus ban then this will set a really bad precedent in regards to referee’s safety
"Honestly I don't even hate vini I have respect for him but I only hate a like genuinely single guy from this RM team and it's Rudiger 
Dude doesn't even try to get the ball straight up malice tackles , a part of me thought maybe this guy knows that we still have a long season ahead and players are returning from injuries he just wanted to injure some of our key players"
"Woah that miscarriage insult is crazy. I bet it's probably even worse in German

Edit: People are saying its a pretty common insult in Germany lol. Still a major head loss from Rudiger though"
Such a classy fella
"For reference, Lewandowski got a 3 match ban for touching his nose after being sent off. Let’s see what punishment Rudiger gets"
Wirklich beschämend 🤦🏻‍♂️🫣
This is one of the lowest points in Real's history
"Yeah he's still gonna play the match on 11th

They may even ask him to find atlantis or find life on Mars but they will definitely not ban him enough to miss that game"
Rudiger testing credit limits on the special privelege card passed on to him by Casemiro and Ramos
"Just for context, calling someone “Du Hurensohn” (German version) is probably the harshest insult in Germany. If he said that in the Bundesliga, that would be it for him."
"Ah Rüdiger with the ""deutsch Rap"" special. What a Clowns Show, smh."
Rudiger/Madrid-a match made in heaven. Underneath the exterior is a hatred that really shows when they're losing.
"Didn’t he also say ""Fotze"" (cunt)?"
"1 match ban followed by a rmtv documentary about injustice and the referee being a barça fan in 3, 2, 1..."
Qualification for being a real madrid CB : be an absolute piece of shit.
Will there be a video from RMTV proving that the referee's mother is indeed a w**e?
Everton will pay severely for this
"Their beyond ridiculous with their behaviour at this point, I’m so glad it’s not like this in the PL."
Life time ban from football when? That's what he deserves. Also an formal investigation for attempted assault. And he needs psych analysis.
What even for? The game would have wrapped in 90 mins of not for the ref.
Ban him for life. Bro was trying to murder the ref
“You’re a miscarriage” is fucking wild lol
This dude has been deserving of a long ban for a long fucking time. He is only tolerated because he's good at what he does.
You can get him out of Berlin but you cannot get Berlin out of him.
"Lmao, maybe he let his own club's propaganda get to his head"
very loooong ban for one game -.-
He's not going to face SHIT. RMA shirt is the best defense against any punishment
"Pepe, Ramos, Rudiger, Asencio... Idk guys, i'm starting to see a pattern here. In order to be a Real Madrid CB, it seems you have to be ""a wee bit"" of a cunt."
Yea!! He kinda deserves every bit of it. That was a total disgrace ffs.
"""You're a miscarriage""  
I...fucking what?! Hahaha."
"Lmao, 1 game."
"I know it won't happen, but as a German, I hope he finally gets ousted from the national team, sick and tired of having a buffoon like him represent my country."
"Piece of shit is going to get away with it lol, Real Player…"
Hopefully they throw the book at him and ban him for a very long time. Horrible player.
The Madrid continual crash outside this season has been hilarious. Just making a holy show of themselves week in week out.
"""You are a miscarriage"" is a brand new insult lmao"
"Can get the man out of Berlin, but not Berlin out of the man."
"This guy should be sent to a rehabilitation facility. 
He needs HELP. Such behaviour is unacceptable in any social circumstances."
Is Real Madrid were a decent club they would punish him as well. I can only imagine what Klopp or Pep would do if their players acted like this. DISGRACEFUL
Absolutely disgraceful display from him and a few others. Make an example of him or this shit will just keep happening. A lengthy ban and a massive fine for the club and the player is the only right thing to do. The entitlement from these childish idiots is getting out of hand.
"""Du Missgeburt"" does not really translate to ""you are a miscarriage"" its more like ""you are a person with a birth defect"""
Attempting to assault an official should carry heavy penalty.  Otherwise it will be considered acceptable and there is no shortage of dickheads who desires violence.
"On another side of it, when fans throw stuff at players, they would expect lifetime bans for the culprits. What sort of example is he setting here?"
"1 match... but wait, the referee forgot to write any of it in the official report. He even forgot Rudiger got a red. No match ban (he's really a nice guy if you get to know him better) hahaha"
"Paulo Fonseca is on a 9 month ban for a face to face, it can be way more for Rudiger"
What an exhausting club Real Madrid is
 I cant remember any other club having a meltdown as pathetic as this one.
He was definitely on tilt.
"German here. Hurensohn is pretty much one of the worst insults you can throw around, even though it's literal translation ""son of a bitch/whore"" is pretty mild. Same applies to Missgeburt. As a professional footballer (and any normal person for that matter), those insults are simply unacceptable."
What can we expect from the club that put out astatement like they did before the game about the ref. A vile club from top to bottom.
so 1 match it is
Severe?! He might actually get 2 games ban for this then
"""Son of a bitch/whore"" is par for the course when abusing referees, which says it all about footballers.

But there is something vile about calling someone ""a miscarriage"". That alone should be grounds for a significant ban without even factoring in the object throwing."
"Ronaldo was banned for 5 matches for pushing referee. Now a player can do things like these and how many games will he get? 2-3 tops, shows how far La Liga has fallen into corruption"
"Fuck this guy,he's a disgrace to football him and several of his teammates,can't stand these pieces of shit,and their club enables them as well"
Honestly what were Everton thinking? Dock them now
Least entitled club
Believe it when I see it
"The insults aren’t in the referee‘s report, so idk if that part matters (it obviously should)"
"As he should, what the fuck is wrong with him?

His celebrations stink, he had that weird situation of bullying was it a kit man? Just an utter twat with an attitude problem."
"""Very severe"""
One match ban it is!
Bro is the Draymond Green of football
I should think so too
That's cool and all but dude linked a Chosun Biz article to break the news lol
"Well, I didn’t expect to read ‘you’re a miscarriage’ whilst eating my breakfast today."
Do RM train their players to act little fucking bitches? There are so few of them who aren't aggressively dislikable arseholes.
"And he wanted to go assault him, there is no other explanation for AGRESSIVELY he was trying to go to the ref while he was being held back by the staff and his mates. This dude and Carvajal were utter fcking clowns, in the circus that was Madrid they still managed to shine the brightest. If Football was fair he is getting like a 6 months ban at minimum."
Rudiger needs to be a little bit more humble and a little bit less a cunt
He is so extra.
Awful. He literally needs help his eyes were wild he was so angry.
I think this is his first red in three years or so? Hard to believe based on the way he is playing
I can’t believe our boy is joining these sore losers… sad times.
"Before the match the Real Madrid was already disrespecting the referee and set the tone. 

I always find it fascinating when people loose complete control and try to dehumanize the ""enemy"" . Of course we cannot expect football players to behave the same as university professors, they behave differently because they come from different backgrounds. Being a cunt is not something we choose to be.

I assume the referee wasn't really the son of a prostitute or had severe handicaps at birth, therefore I personally think throwing objects and the aggressive behavior is far worse than a bit of meaningless cursing. But what the club did before the match was for me far worse, because a professional organization should behave better. But Spain being Spain I expect not much."
Good. As he should. Fucking embarrassing.
If he plays again before September something has gone wrong.
"Somewhat related but how did Vinicius not get a red? There is literally video of him doing the exact same thing as Lucas Vasquez and he got one, so why not Vini?"
"and the worst of them all: ""Sprich Deutsch..."""
"We need to be humbled a bit...  
This is a disgrace on every level and I hope the club looks inwards and purges this self-destructive behaviour..."
"This guy is a disgrace and he does not deserve to wear that jersey. I don’t know why Real Madrid, the biggest club in history of football allows this kind of behavior under it’s roof. It’s not only about this incident but he’s constantly disrespecting the opponent in a harmful way."
So a game or two?
he is called RUDEiger for a reason
The fact he _could_ only face a severe ban is laughable.
No he won’t
🤣 come on huh we all know how that ends
I legit thought he was going to stab the ref. Was adamant I was about to witness a murder on live TV. Fucking unhinged.
Rudiger should get some help.
A severe ban of whole 180 Minutes
2 games and 1.000€
"He was always nuts, but the nuttery only intesified in madrid. "
I wonder who would win in a fight between Antonio Rudiger and Isaiah Stewart. Both are absolutely crazy and need people to hold them back from doing something crazy.
A half match ban you mean
"""Du hurensohn""

Now I want to learn German next."
Worldwide lifetime ban.
"Jesus Christ, those comments 

He needs a very lengthy ban"
"needs a big ban, and madrid need a big fine too because it wasn't only him, few others berating the ref"
Du kriegst Rüdiger aus‘m Wedding aber den Wedding nicht aus Rüdiger 
Disgraceful behavior. I've always known he's an ass but this takes it to another low.
What an animal
"CBs that played for Chelsea 🤝 being a massive fucking cunt (Terry, Rudiger, Zouma, are there others I missed?)"
"Rude-iger, more like"
"He was clearly fighting for the ball, 1 match ban is the best I can do."
Throw the book at him. Man is a liability
he belongs in a mental asylum 
"But he said he's sorry...after he realize or someone told him what he did and what the consequences might be...so he's sorry, so they can't give him real punishment or it's unfair"
Betcha he won’t
"Do it. I love Rudiger as a player, love his enthusiasm while defending but this was too far. 

Throwing something at the referee is just not  acceptable. You don't want kids looking up to him to think this is acceptable or even ""manly"" behaviour."
Always nice when people you suspect are scum confirm it in public
"A well deserved rest for him. Its not like they have a chance at any title.
Although i can see this taking longer to decide and him being suspended for next season or the last games where there s nothing to fight for"
Ban him from the national team too
"Any German speaker able to explain the etymology of 'missgeburt'?

English is obviously not a real language, just German, Latin and French wearing a trenchcoat made out of words stolen from a few other languages. In English we have an archaic word 'misbegotten', from 'mis' (incorrectly / poorly) and 'begot' (patented / fathered). The meaning (created terribly) would appear to be very similar to what German speakers are saying 'missgeburt' means, and it's practically an anagram as well.

I hope the words are related. I love the idea of Rudiger becoming Dickensian when he's angry."
The ref deserved it
This man child is just playing tough guy. The character ate him. He should be banned for months.
"Considering how Madrid are with their image (hilarious, I know), he might just get shipped off at the end of the season. Potentially career derailing action here.

Then he goes and joins Marseille lmao"
"Not condoning Rüdiger's behavior, but haha, he comes from the hood. German talk to each other like that regularly in our more rougher areas or schoolyards."
So that he can be fully fit for the El Classico
and a hefty fine of  100 euros
"If Real Madrid continue to avoid fair punishment, I honestly can’t understand — and never will understand why people still waste their time watching La Liga. It’s their last chance to set things right now after they fucked up with the «1 match» ban for Mbappe"
"I think this man can’t be helped by simply handing him a ban, this guy should go in mandatory therapy and work on himself. 

By the way it would have been a nice social experiment if the coaches and teammates didn’t restrain him on the sideline. Would he have chased the referee over the field and ripped his heart out?

On the scale of complete nutcases he’s almost in the same exclusive upper tier as former Madrid defender Pepe. That would have been some next level horror show if they played together as centre backs."
For the ref..
"If you think about it, Rudiger and Madrid are a perfect match"
Very severe!
"Personally, I don’t think he should be able to play another cup match all season."
And receive an apology from the ref.
He is. Always has been.
Seems ??!?!?
"Players do get worse at Madrid. That environment makes players the most entitled, arrogant, malevolent pieces of shit. Bunch of fucking weirdos at what's probably the most unlikeable club in elite football."
"I never noticed it at Chelsea other than the usual shithousery. 

Being at Madrid as enabled the absolute worst sides of him. But he's not alone here. Other players become something else when they get to bernabeu"
RM seems to bring out the worst in players behaviour-wise. Bellingham was genuinely likeable in the beginning - man now can't even show basic respect to opponents in the guard of honour and yesterday got carded again for aggression towards refs.
He was always a cunt even at Chelsea but I don't remember him as bad as we are seeing now.
Nooo nooo he’s a sigma alpha strong powerful male omg omgg🥺 People were praising this asshole for being a bully
"Transfer to Madrid has gone into his head. Even during the 1st leg against Arsenal, his attitude was belittling. 

And, tries hurting his opponents with most of his challenges. Not sure how refs overlook his challenges."
"Guy is a disgusting thug, bullying piece of shit and last night was absolutely pathetic from every single one of them. They always manage to infuriate me ...somehow ...

I'm so glad they aren't winning shit this year because they don't deserve anything. For all the full blown officials intimidation antics every week, I still can see Barca being able to go hard in ucl and still win the league.

I hope he gets a seriously lengthy ban (for once..) and the club an enormous fine for that shocking display. 

Disgusting Club and enough is enough"
He attacked a coach as well
When finally people realise how he is.. i remember everyone laughing because he was “el loco” and run like a dinosaur xD
"The refs and Madrid have let him get away with shit game after game.I have seen comments by Madrid fans in the past where they are okay with excessive tackle and violent behavior comparing those to their legends Ramos and Pepe.

If the club has punished him for his behavior towards their own staff, he may not have got here. If the refs have carded him appropriately, he may be more restrained."
"What I don’t get is he always gets away with his dirty game. Now everyone knows, every ref knows. Yet he never gets sent off, and usually gets his first yellow at the 89th min"
"Always been but florentino puppets (spanish media) gaslighted everyone into thinking he is just a comedy genius because he played with a policemen before a match, so everyone reacts to his shit laughing.

""He is so crazy guys 🤣"" , ""Bro is completely unchained 🤣"" are the usual reactions to his agression and thug attitude.

Same with Bellingham, they call him ""The English Gentleman"" when he is another entitled POS."
"And don’t forget, this unhinged reaction was because of a single foul that didn’t go their way. Not a penalty, not a red card, just a simple free kick. And this is after Barça were denied 2 clear penalties as well."
Football's draymond green
Points reduction for Everton
Atletico somehow gonna get a ban for this
Don’t forget community service for his buddy Max Verstappen
And a 2 match ban for Harshit Rana.
This type of attitude shouldn’t be tolerated and I hope he does indeed get a massive ban
"Eric Garcia's greatest contribution for us, we might have won the cup but the world won a Rudiger crashout"
"Can confirm, was in the stadium up above the bit. I look down at the commotion and just see him throw something towards the ref and I was laughing so much"
Camavinga's second yellow at the Emirates was *chef's kiss*
I think posts of that was deleted from r/soccer
He'll throw it back.
Its crazy how fragile the egos of like half the Real team are. 1 poor season after they literally won the League and the UCL last year and they are in complete meltdown.
"You’re not alone. It’s very embarrassing.



Imagine your parent comes to the school and yells at all your friends in front of everyone then proceeds to shit their pants immediately afterwards"
">Throw the book at him.

Live by the projectile die by the projectile"
"A Missgeburt is someone born with severe bodily aberrations, i dont think there even is a proper english word to translate that directly into."
Equivalent to Mal nacido then?
Not really. The young people use it all the time if they curse
"I don’t understand what fantasy realm Real Madrid occupy, the club who has rights to complain was their opponent (although Rudiger’s actions are inexcusable whatever the refereeing)"
What's crazy is he did miss a penalty...at Rüdiger's foul on Ferran. Getting this mad at the ref when he missed a major call in your favour is absolutely wild.
The ref actually helped them with missed pens
Except he did........
"I saw this coming sooner or later, the craziest part about all this is that this was his first red at Madrid."
As fan a Chelsea I was one of the few who didn’t care if Rudiger renewed with us or not because of this exact behaviour. Later his agent behaviour came out and I wasn’t surpised why Marina didn’t give proper extension
I swear he wasn't this bad at Chelsea?? Or am I just not remembering?
*this is Real Madrid
Mbappe got saved by the referee report. Referee had stated in his report that Mbappe went for the ball and bureaucracy trumps common sense in Spain. Referee did not hold back against Rudiger in his report and stated him throwing an object and mentioned violent conduct. I can see a lengthy ban.
He also stated he was sorry..
"Nah, it's not just anger issues. He's just a bully. His actions on the pitch show it. Then there's that thing with the Madrid coaching staff."
Spoiler alert : it won’t
"Vinis only a drama queen on the pitch, off the pitch he’s a good guy, Rudiger on the other hand…"
I always thought Ramos was a shithouse but in comes Rudiger and becomes the shittiest house of them all.
"""Missgeburt"" has nothing to do with misscarriage when used as an insult, it means: a living being born with severe malformations"
I wouldn’t say miscarriage is the right translation for missgeburt. It’s more so someone that’s been born with a visible birth defect. Still disgusting to call someone that
"Actually in English it sounds worse, became too casual in German"
Every insult is worse in German
"It really does sound awful but its something that used to get thrown around a lot in Germany, even around friends. You dont hear it as much nowadays though I feel like. 

Not saying it wasnt meant in a derogatory way of course."
True. Fehlgeburt is the German word for miscarriage.
Nah it’s not. It used to be a quite common insult when I grew up and only got less common in the last years when we all started to be a little more careful with our words. Still hear it here and there. So while definitely far beyond what should be said to a referee and justifying a harsh punishment it’s one of these stupid insults we grew up with that some people still use and others might use it automatically when emotional.
"Missgeburt is a very casual insult in German, thrown around a lot. When you translate it you realise how bad it actually is 😅"
"Translating insults sometimes make them sound weird, like Correa recently with “Hijo de re mil putas” which translated literally sounds like son of thousand bitches"
In some African countries that insult would be *illegal!*
"It is but when I first read this post I was wondering if you had inside info about his Mum, given the other insult."
"Like even if we be honest and say Lewa was jokingly applying the ref was high, 3 game ban was weird and it’s not even comparable to this weirdo’s case but I fully expect the punishment to be similar."
The punishment will probably be 3 more games for Lewandowski
Should be the same as that Lyon coach
Not even Pepe or Ramos were this bad
"""mfs who started watching football 10 years ago"":"
i‘d say missgeburt is even worse tbh
"If Suarez can bite a player on 3 separate occasionsand not get a lifetime ban, then I don’t think this will get one either. He’ll probably get a few months"
This is the Real Madrid we are talking about. They get away with some serious shit
A very common insult here in Germany actually
a true neuköllner
I saw this same point on a yt video about the coaching staff thing. Could you provide context?
"it‘s a pretty normal insult for…let‘s say less educated people in german, sounds very weird when translated haha"
And some docked points for your team!
"Forget docking points, just directly relegate them to the championship at this point"
"I hope he watched that match.

Seeing Reals true colours might change his mind."
what about Raphina in La Liga?
"with schlotti injured this would hurt our defense a lot but still, fuck him. there‘s something very wrong with that guy."
"So ""Missgeburt"" does not mean ""miscarriage"", it means ""someone with a birth defect"". ""Geburt"" ist obv. the German word for ""birth"" and the ""Miss""-part comes from the old german word ""missa"" which means ""wechselseitig, schlecht, verfehlt, verunglückt"" or translated ""reciprocal, bad, missed, accidental/failed"""
"Except he’s not playing tough guy, he is legitimately dangerous and has been a danger on the pitch for a long time even in Chelsea he had some messed up moments but it’s gotten way worse as time has gone on. It’s not just dangerous challenges either."
"Nothing of that sort is gonna happen. Madrid stuck with cunts like Ramos and Pepe and they're club legends, you can only imagine they'd stick with Rudiger as well. That club doesn't care about sportsmanship as long as they're winning trophies to inflate their ego."
So he can lose another one.
I mean that sounds like a win for Barca tbf… the brother is shiiiiiiiit
Iirc minor suspensions don’t transfer over to LaLiga. If it’s one game I don’t think he’ll be ineligible for LaLiga.
Funny coming from a Chelsea fan actively cheating psr...
not been helped by the fact he’s consistently been allowed to get away with murder for years
Exactly and being at Madrid will again let him get away with it
The clips of him and the materials guy are appalling.
"I've been saying that for years. I'm so glad he's German, so at least on the national team level I don't have to endure him."
I don't remember him this way at Roma tbh
"His ‚accent‘ in German kinda supports that…besides everything we know about him.

He has that very strong ‚big city ghetto accent‘"
"To be fair I've seen him in interviews and he actually seems fairly laid-back, he's just absolutely mental on the football field. Whether or not that makes him any more likeable is obviously up to you, but I'm just saying, I don't think he's actually a bad person, he just absolutely loses his head occasionally."
Agreed thoroughly.. Bunch of precious arseholes.
Feels like this.
"Exactly. He had the edge and shothousery like Costa at Chelsea but he looked like a decent human off it.

But at madrid, he has become worst. I guess, it the club culture."
You didn't notice him assassinating De Bruyne in the CL final?
Jude was quite unlikeable at Dortmund too
Bellingham was never likable. He’s always been a whiner and a hot headed idiot.
"Kid needs bringing down a peg or 18.

Majorly, *majorly* bought into his own hype, especially since joining Real Madrid and it really shows.

You can see it in his performances for England too. Lad is far too arrogant for his own good."
Unless your last name is Kroos.
"bellingham was already a massive whiner at dortmund, the only thing madrid does is bring thier whining to the biggest stage"
"They're like Chelsea in the 00s it's like being a massive unlikeable, whingy prick is a prerequisite"
If you go to a crybaby club you become a crybaby it's just a matter of time Mbappé become one too.
He was king of shithousery but decent lad off it. He behaves like a lunatic out of asylum now.
"Great comparison, except Draymond is weirdly likeable off the court imo."
That's a great shout tbf.
And Vitesse
6 months ban for Correa
"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Im dying, lmfaoo"
And 2 superlicense penalty points for Kevin Magnussen
And a 50% fine for digvesh rathi
"I know it's not going to happen, but it easily could be interpreted as threatening and attacking a referee. I'd love to see the real punishment applied of 4 month ban minimum. Madrid players need to be put in their place and shut the fuck up. "
But respectfully!
Son of a librarian. 
He threw it to the air.
Started with the Balon d’Or stuff. That was so pathetic.
"What's wild is that it isn't technically even a really poor season results-wise, bar their UCL elimination. They still could win La Liga and got to the Copa final, but they have such a high opinion of themselves that they think anything but winning everything every year is completely unacceptable. Heck, even if they win they still find ways to complain."
They are a bunch of entitled brats that cry and complain whenever things don't go their way. I am so glad that people who don't follow La Liga can finally see how embarrassing their players really are.
That's basically the classic definition of a freak
"Not a direct translation, but probably the closest would be calling someone an ""inbred"" which implies they would have physical and mental deformations"
Probably similar to how cunt is said all the time between friends but if you call someone a cunt in anger you’ll probably get punched.
But Rüdiger is an adult. Adults very very rarely call each other Missgeburt.
"Young german here: ""Hurenson"" is pretty common and a light curse that can even be used  lightheartedly to friends. However context matters and ton of voice matters a lot, theres a difference if its said aggressively. 

""Missgeburt"" however is pretty heavy and only used if you actually want to insult that person."
among young people everything is a meme. but if an adult calls another adult Missgeburt you either get punched or sued
"I think that’s the joke lol, he missed several potential penalties for Barca (Cubarsí, Ferran) and a potential red card for Tchouameni’s two-legged challenge on Olmo"
"But there is a nuance… relevant Russian anecdote:  

Petka asks Chapaev:
“Vasily Ivanovich, what’s a nuance?”

Chapaev replies:
“Take off your pants, Petka. I’ll show you.”

Petka, a bit confused, takes off his pants. Chapaev comes up behind him, sticks his dick in Petka’s ass, and says:
“See, Petka — you feel a dick in the ass, and I feel a dick in the ass. But there’s a nuance…"
People really didn't get this comment
He did. Just not for Real.
Becomes less crazy once you factor in other real angels like Casemiro or Pepe also barely getting any red cards during their stints there
"I think he's probably changed due to the new environment.

Real Madrid are a very entitled club and they very much act that way, so it will have an effect on the players.

They boycotted the Ballon d'Or because one of their players didn't win it, even though they had other players and their manager win other awards at the ceremony. They complained about the referee they were going to get before the cup final so much that it actually caused him to break down in tears in his press conference. 

They wrote a formal letter of complaint to the Spanish FA and to Spain's High Council for Sports saying that  Spanish refereeing was ""rigged"" and ""completely discredited"", all because they weren't top of the league that year.

All of this has to have had an impact in how their players behave. If you cry conspiracy every time you lose a game or if you just keep blustering about referees etc, then it will, eventually, just rub off on the players too."
"He wasn't, Tuchel used to make the players do training matches with tennis balls in their hands to prevent them from pulling shirts. 

The coaching at Chelsea discouraged this type of behaviour in game, Madrid seems to be the opposite."
He did break KDB's face in a final...
I think he wasn't THIS mean but he was still a quite dirty player who often went unpunished with his tackles or holding player.
As a Madrid fan I’m glad some of our players are finally getting red their attitude has gotten too much I know we were like this a bit in the CR7/Messi Ramos Pepe Pique era but this is worse the most we did was swarm the referee maybe dissent. Our current players have gotten too comfy disrespect officials even our board has. I still find it shocking Bellingham got a red today but not Vini considering they did the same
THIS IS SPARTA!
"he is legit mentally ill, sociopath or smthg"
Rudiger is such a cunt man a dirty player
Lmao the Ballon D'or shitshow was off the pitch
"Yep and even as an insult no one saying that to someone really means to say ""youre deformed!"" its simply more like an extreme version of ""youre a piece of shit"", very common insult among teenagers"
Misbegotten maybe?
"Oh we actually have that in Spanish, “malnacido!” But it sounds a bit telenovela-like so it has no aura"
"The second one is worse I think isn't?

I know you guys have a Timo Werner song with it for some reason lol"
In the comment thread above someone is saying it’s a very heavy insult in Germany haha. Maybe it depends on the area?
And then German insults are kinda cute if you compare it to the Dutch ones.
we are goated when it comes to insults ngl
"It feels like the kind of insult being used by a 13-year old. I probably used it too, when I was at that age. If I'd hear it from an adult, I'd be worried about their mental maturity."
What the hell are you talking about? It is not a casual insult.
What the fuck are your social circles where you hear Missgeburt a lot? Thats something you say if you want to get punched in the face.
You right they will ban Lewa for another 3 games for what Rudiger did.
Pepe was literally and very much intentionally head kicking a guy laying face down on the ground. That was inarguably straight up assault in front of 10000s of people
"Ah, but did he ever bite a ref?"
"I never understood this logic. Suarez did the same thing more than once and then that should be a factor in a punishment. 

But I've never seen that applied to other players. Do you know if there are any examples of repeat offenses leading to a bigger punishment?"
What about him?
"I disagree. As stupid and uneducated footballers tend to be all of them know that there are lines which cannot be crossed as they mean being out of a highly lucrative job.


This man would have not thrown that ice bag at the referee again nor assault him, beyond the usual insults to his face."
"It's not that they can't stick with cunts, it's about how badly it presents in the media. Ramos was a cunt but he was hailed as a great defender and such. 

But this Rudiger thing seems to be getting bigger and he's not near as good as player as either of them. Well, depends on how long he has left on his contract. I imagine by the time it runs out this incident would be a thing of the past"
and throw another object at the referee
This is the severe punishment they are looking for
"""I got one more in me!"""
"Literally stomped on a dude the other day lmao, Real Madrid always have me questioning the rules"
"Yeah I don’t get it, refs should know by now? I mean don’t they review their matches? They have to see everything he does, constantly in dodgy situation on corners etc. And I see Raul ascencio taking inspiration, he’s just the same, just not on his lvl yet"
People forget he purposely hit KDB with a blind side shoulder barge to the face in the UCL final.
He leads with his elbow for every duel . This game he caught olmo with that move
"Don't you have a rapist playing for your team?
Edit: aren't you trying to RESIGN a rapist?"
"We’re talking about Rudiger, not Marcus Alonso here…"
"Wow that is insane generalising and stereotyping, he might be a cunt but stop with such racially motivated comments, no idea how this comment got upvoted"
Someone's accent is not reflective of their character
“Ghetto accent”
"you really thought ""how do I give a racist spin on this?"""
"Das ist aber dumm von dir. Sein Verhalten ist natürlich nichts Gutes, aber für den Akzent kann er echt nichts."
"I don't know, there are the clips of him slapping staff kitmen, making them trip, forcing people to be part of his ""jokes"".

Overall comes across as a very obnoxious guy with little likable traits beyond ""social"", which is just being loud for those types of people."
Nobody randomly slaps a staff
Pepe Syndrome
There’s losing your head and there’s losing your head. This fella cant go 5 games without losing his rag in the weirdest of ways.
He’s an absolute grade-A cunt on the pitch. It’s part of his character and reflects the kind of person he really is. Just because he comes across well in interviews means nothing - it’s under pressure that people reveal their true nature.
"Laid back or not, he’s dangerous on the field. I saw people getting summoned and punished by police for way less than that during Sunday league games"
"If he regularly does bad things why is he not a bad person? 

Do we get free passes if it’s just “losing our heads” or something but we’re chill the rest of the time."
"His interviews are 100% PR managed. Last time the video of him bullying the kitman went viral, the very next day he was doing an online interview with a face of utter innocence, praising players of other teams. In isolation it's normal behaviour, but in the context of what's going on it was obvious damage minimisation PR."
"Body checks like that happen all the time in football.

It shouldn't but it does."
I assume they liked him at Birmingham?
Didn’t he yell at a defender once for not overlapping or sth lol
"He was also only 19 when he joined Madrid, he’s still a child with a lot of growing up to do. Rudiger is 32."
"As an England fan, I like Bellingham in a very different way to how I like Saka and Rice. Bellingham has that talent and nasty streak that we need while Saka and Rice are both brilliant players and lovely blokes."
"The first time I saw him properly was the England france match in the 2022 world cup, was trying to get a French player sent off then did that ""oh my dayyyys"" holding his head. Get in the sea you silly baby."
"Thats going to be difficult though, the lad rocked up at a euros, saw England almost get knocked out early in a shocking performance and just whipped out an overhead kick.

He walks the talk."
Us against the world mentality
He literally said kat was afraid of him and ducking him when in actuality his family member died. How is draymond likeable off the court
While saying “Danke”
Exactly. This was the point where all the whiny entitled behaviour started.
Copa is done it was final only chance in league for them where they trail by 4 points . 
"imo their league position flatters them alot, the amount of games they won out of pure lucky or Courtois being a demon by 1 goal is crazy, reminds me of our last season, we should've been 14th but pure individual brilliance and luck covered it up"
Sounds exactly like Pep’s Barca then
"In the anglo word, a ""freak"" is usually a good thing no? At least I've heard it more in positive contexts. I think ""inbred"" is more like it, it can only be negative."
"Maybe ""abomination"" could be a close translation, since it implies deformities more heavily? Idk, just scrambling for ideas."
Flid? That’s used for people born with deformities after their mother took thalidomide
"What's the German for ""arrested development""?"
"light curse? nah, Hurensohn, if used in earnest, is one of the most severe (non-discriminatory) insults in the german language. true, in internet culture people are starting to use it ironically as a meme, but if you call someone a Hurensohn IRL you're usually in deep trouble. "
"And a red on modric, instead he fit a yellow"
What was the ferran situation again? I remember Cubarsi call
"Oh, it's starting. It will become four unawarded penalities soon.

Cubarsi held Asencio as much as the other way.

Ferran was a slight touch he wanted to leverage.

The ref was very good, and while the last foul maybe wasn't clear cut, the reactions were ridiculous."
"I'm on your side, buddy"
"Fucking hell, the nuance anecdote in the wild, and on r/soccer of all places"
That's the joke
"When Casemiro was sent off for the second time in 40 days  at United, the stats people wrote that he matched his Real Madrid total in red cards. 

He played 9 years for Real Madrid."
Casemiro going to United and getting two straight reds in quick succession said it all - RM players are used to getting away with shit and are shocked when they move elsewhere and the same behaviours get them sent off.
The MAGAs of football.
Fish rots from the head.
"> Tuchel used to make the players do training matches with tennis balls in their hands to prevent them from pulling shirts. 

>The coaching at Chelsea discouraged this type of behaviour in

Wow. That is such a great way to drill the idea into young players that you can't take the easy way out and have to actually defend better in order to succeed at the top level."
And got away with it
"I'm not sure, I just see enablers and ""but pep's barca tho, they huuhhh made tactical foults too (lmao?)""

The entire club has been like this since pepe/ramos era, if you like real madrid you like it because they get to bully other teams or just buy their best players and get to intimidate/influence refs."
"But that was the club throwing a massive tantrum, I don't remember him doing/saying anything except ""he will do it 10 times harder on the pitch"" did he say anything else? I genuinely can't remember"
"> it sounds a bit telenovela-like so it has no aura

😂 Never heard someone refer to insults as concepts with ""aura"" but I get what you mean. It just doesn't sound insulting at all in Spanish. Almost quirky and old-fashioned."
"It's completely lost that meaning in Spanish. If you look it up in the RAE dictionary it only means ""indeseable, despreciable""."
"Aunque técnicamente ese es el significado, nunca habia pensado que ese insulto se usara de esa manera"
"Hurensohn became kind of a meme because of how dirty it sounds so people got a little numb to it. But yeah, it’s probably worse and will get you beaten up if it’s said to the wrong person"
I think it's because he play for Leipzig and he is known as serial diver in Germany (or is it just because one dive?).
"I I recall correctly, that Timo Werner song came up because of a massive dive of him which resulted in a pen and of course because he played at RB."
Hurensohn is something you only say to your closest friends for fun. If you say it to anybody else you deserve to get punched in the face. Basically one of the worst insults our language has in stock.
It gets / used to get thrown around super casually by younger individuals.
"While I was growing up. ""Scheiss Missge"" was thrown around a lot. Haven't used or really heard the word used since I was 14 or so 🤷🏻‍♂️"
"Yes, If you rack up enough yellow cards, you get banned for a few games"
"Idk we’re talking about easily the most violent footballer currently playing anywhere near top competition, someone who stepped on that Arsenal player who’s like 18 after taking him down just to hurt him and because he knows he won’t get punished"
But this time a chair
And get a WHOPPING 1 match ban 
Full respect for object and 3 match ban for referee
"80% of your comments are just ""anulo mufa"" learn another word"
Dude should've been sent off at least twice against us
"It's a miracle that his stomp on MLS didn't had major consequences for both (Rudiger sent off and MLS to the hospital).

 A heavy guy like him stomping a teenager in the groin with his plates... you can hurt a person for life with that."
"Ima be honest, you're just getting a dose of La Liga refs. This is why Getafe and others are allowed to do this shit constantly. I don't like that Rudiger does his usual shit, not even talking about yesterday, but the bigger problem is refs allowing every team to do this kind of playstyle while being either unpunished or lightly so. I know it's ironic because of RMTV complaints, so I want to note that fuck RMTV and everyone allowing/promoting what they do within the club. But I wish this was punished accordingly, and this goes for clubs like Getafe, for Rudiger, for Mbappe's light suspension and so on."
Mbappe with a leg breaker also got a one game. They bitched about that too.
"Yeah Partey is piece of shit and I hate that he is still playing for us but how does it change the fact that Rudiger is a psychopath?


Partey has nothing to do with Rudiger's behaviour..."
"real madrid's biggest legend is a rapist too, if you want to chat about that"
What does have this to do with the topic here?
"we do and we reportedly are, but what relevance does that have to Rudiger?

this isn’t a point scoring exercise or trying to pit one bad thing against another"
"There‘s nothing racist about that. He‘s born and raised in Germany and there‘s also nothing to imply in terms of discrimination since his pronunciation is perfect.

What I mean by accent is a very basic selection of words…more like a „brocabulary“ that makes him appear in a certain way, that matches his impulsiveness on the pitch.

Nothing more, nothing less. I would make that comment about Thomas Müller as well."
He sounds black alright
Classic high school bully behaviour
"Pepe has had some spectacular meltdowns, but in general I don’t think he was actually that dirty. Ramos was by far the dirtier player of the two."
"Pepe's rough af but watching him against Arsenal what like a year ago he was brilliant and wasn't dirty. he got respect from both fans the way he played. incredibly strong, tons of heart, hyping up his own fans after making tackles 5mins from the end. Rudigers nothing like that he was fucking filthy against Arsenal bout a week ago. genuinely the most disgusting player ive seen on the pitch. i used to like him as well. even when that clip came out of him repeatedly slapping that old man who works at Madrid i was like ahhh probly not that bad. but nah hes a piece of shit."
"Thats also not correct. Under pressure reveals peoples nature under pressure. Some get nervous, some get angry, some get panic attacks etc."
"You see people with their nose and orbital bone fractured in CL Finals all the time? Or even in regular top league play? I have nothing to say about Rudiger off the pitch because I don't know him, but on the pitch he's always been a thug and a dirty, underhanded player. Him intentionally injuring De Bruyne off the ball won Chelsea a CL final, which I'm sure is why you seem to think nothing of it."
I don’t think Orbital Fractures happen in Football that is a largely combats sports injury. Which tells you all you need to know about that
Only because his name resembles the club's.
"Yeah fair enough but he’s 21 now so not exactly a kid anymore. It’s Ancelotti’s job to discipline his players and he failed. Young players should be taught to keep their emotions in check. He’s had many outbursts like these when things don’t go his way. 

Rudiger is just a lunatic. It’s different, that’s who he is and he cannot change."
"You need a dickhead in the middle really. Bellingham growing up idolising a midfield partnership of Gardener, Bowyer and Ferguson actually shuld give us a very good CM if we can limit how much of a twat he becomes."
"I dont mind bellingham. His temper doesnt overflow, he gets angry so he runs faster and maybe moans a little but most of it goes into his performance"
Exactly. Jude walks the talk. I think he needs that at that level.
"Not all the time, but I think he makes good points 70% of the time on his pod with BD. I also am biased as I am a big Lebron fan and Draymond really likes LeBron as well

I thought he covered the SAS vs LeBron feud pretty well, the Doc vs JJ Reddick spat a year ago pretty well, and the “why is Kobe not in the GOAT debate” question very well, etc. 

He’s had really good points that I like and does com across as likeable more so than Rudiger who is really a cold human being and not in a good way"
"They still have chance in league.

Even if Barca beat Vallodolid next week.. as should.. if Real beat Barca then Barca still have tough games like Atheltic away."
Damn when did Pep's Barca assaulted the refs and threatened to forfeit a match?
"Only very recently in history has freak been used just as more of a positive/outlier scenario. The full phrase is usually ""freak of nature"" aka aberration. It's not positive. 

It's how circuses would identify their 'peculiar' individuals for people to gawk at because they'd never seen anything like it.

Obviously, we no longer call people suffering from deformities 'freaks'."
"""Freak"" has many meanings in different contexts.

""Inbred"" is probably closer in meaning, but doesn't directly imply any actual defects.

There are slurs which might match even more closely, but I won't be repeating them because they're slurs."
"""Freak"" is a good thing maybe if you only listen to 1970s Soul music"
"Not really. Though freak is sometimes used in a positive way to say someone is abnormally good or powerful, it usually means someone is weird and strange, which could mean someone that severe physical defects"
"I can understand thinking freak has a positive connotation if you consume most your English through sports, but like others have said, the word has a longer history of being negative."
I would suggest defect but that could be pretty off still
Geistig hängen geblieben.
"True, but imo. Missgeburt is a level above. It's kind if a despicable word to actually use against someone in sincerity."
"Dude I am german and lived in germany my whole life, while growing up me and my friends called each other Hurenson IRL around a dozen times per week. Same for other kids. It's still like that and has been common for at least 15-20 years. I wouldn't say the internet or internet culture has anything to do with that at all and it's definitely not a meme. It's just part of the youg people language.

Edit: Also even when used earnestly it's in no way one of the most severe insults. ""Missgeburt"" for example is way more severe."
"That’s why I said potential penalties. There’s arguments to be made for both sides, give the penalty or don’t. Just as with Tchouameni’s challenge being a red or not (crazy that that wasn’t even a yellow though).

At least you’re better than your fellow Madridista’s (and Bellingham lol) who are claiming the ref was against them, because that’s true delusion"
"It'd be hilarious if it wasnt infuriating at the same time

There is no club in world football that gets away with as much shit as Real on the pitch (off the pitch City probably slams them)"
It is the primary reason why I could never get on board with him as a fantastic player / best DM in the world /of all time / whatever when those kinds of conversations were raging. There is some skill / ability to charming the ref and not getting yellows for or not getting yellows on the first opportunity you present to the ref and same with red cards. Casemiro though I felt like had slam dunk red card challenges every match I would see him play and would just not get a yellow even. Completely absurd (unless there was more nefarious business going on...)
"That's more on the Spanish refs rather than any particular club.

Go watch a single Getafe game and the lack of cards against them then you'll understand. And nobody claims Getafe have the refs in their pocket"
 Both were soft af
Both fascist also
"I used to coach kids' handball, and the easiest way to get rid of unwanted behavior was to build the natural instinct to not do it by simply making it impossible in practice. Want the players to dribble the ball less? Ban bouncing the ball during practice games. Want to make them shoot with their arm fully extended? Make them jump between two mattresses so they're forced to put the arm all the way up."
"Nah even as a biased Madrid fan a lot of teams have big egos and push refs around I can admit Madrid is most guilty of this, but it’s never been this bad, anytime Vini loses the ball he looks at the ref for a foul, Rudiger gets away with tackle that prime Ramos nor Pepe will never get away with. Secondly find me a clip of Ronaldo losing the ball asking foot a foul, or Ramos/Pepe throwing stuff at ref, the most they did was raise their tone"
Sounds like a Swedish surname tbh
"And his face, the way it is. I think players have learned that if they want fans of the national team to like them, they can't play for RBL."
"When he left us for Leipzig he said something along the lines of ""I'm excited to go from a traditional club to an ascending traditional club"". That was during peak Leipzig hate times. And yeah, on top of that hes a diver. He also never really played well for the national team.       
But tbh, people kinda forgot and forgave now that hes been away (and playing like shit) for such a long time. The hate isnt nearly as big as it used to be when he scored 25 goals each season for Leipzig."
** your closest friends or anonymously on the internet
"I mean thats not what you said in your previous comment though. Its not a casual insult at all anymore. 15-20 years ago people also said racist stuff like Neger a lot more, you cant really compare today to that."
But the same doesn't apply for red card offenses. Which would make sense I guess but I've never seen it. Plenty of players make red card offenses several times but are always punished by the individual incident.
"True. An institution such as RM should not have players like him within its ranks. I do believe he is more of a ""I am tough"" show than an actually deranged person and is constantly testing the boundaries of what he can get away with. Will stop once he is properly dealt with."
Referee dies
rudiger would fit well in WWE ngl
Hopefully Darwin Nunez wasn't his chair throwing coach.
"Hey, that's Alaba's job."
Was it the chest? From memory I think it more or less was the groin.
"It was his groin which could probably be way worse, rudiger is a fucking psycho"
"May be, Age taught Pepe some basic respect but he was top grade asshole at RM. He literally use to stomp on players (Messi's hand for example) ffs!"
Pepe 10 years ago was honestly worse then Rudiger imo. Yes the Pepe of the last couple of years have been great without being excessively dirty but go back and he makes Rudiger look nice.
"I don't condone body blocks in football but he didn't go in there to intentionally injured him.

If you genuinely think so then you need to reevaluate the situation.

Hypotheticals in football don't exist, Chelsea could have won the game 3/4-0 if they took their clear cut chances but they didn't."
Didn't they retired his shirt number at Birmingham?
"I’ll give bellingham the benefit of the doubt still, I didn’t change too much between 19 and 21, I was still an idiot into my mid 20’s."
"Hey now, Carlo is busy chain smoking! He can’t be bothered disciplining his players. At Bayern the players had such poor conditioning that they organized extra sessions to do cardio. His dumb ass son even whined about it despite it being his fault for the lack of a proper training regime.

He might have been a very good coach, e.g. at AC Milan or Chelsea or his first Real stint but nowadays he’s just coasting off the immense talent of his players."
"Yeah agreed, he’s not growing up in a good way right now, needs a role model or someone to step in and sort him out because it doesn’t bode well."
He did get sent off yesterday for abusing the ref; his second time this season
It will be a cold day in hell before Athletic will try to beat barcelona so madrid they hate madrid as much as barcelone dose
Or watch any sport today. Even e-sports... lol.
"Always positive in sports. ""This guy is a freak of nature."", I'd like to see someone post a youtube link of freak being used negatively in sports because I've honestly never heard it. I'm sure there must be one or two. But if we are honest it is almost exclusively a positive thing in sports."
"Through sports and music. Freak is always a good thing, the times I've heard it anyway."
"Yeah, friends call each other all sorts of shit, always have. What do you think would happen to you if you called your boss, co-worker, teacher, a cop etc. Hurensohn? 


a ""light curse"" would be the english equivalent - son of a bitch. Hurensohn is a much heavier insult. "
"I don't know. I feel like sentiment on the RM sub is similar to mine, but I didn't count."
"Probably? La Liga is miles worse than the Prem on the pitch in regards to this stuff, but nowhere close to the antics that happen behind the scenes with lawyers, nation-states, and foreign actors"
Even with VAR atm that's crazy how refs are indulgents over RM.
"Doesn't matter. he wouldn't get them at Madrid. There were games, especially El clasicos, where not even Madrid fans understood how he escaped double yellows"
"Somewhat related but also unrelated but makes a good story. Rafa Nadal is naturally right handed, like he uses his right hand for everything but his uncle decided he would be better as a left handed player, so he started training Nadal to play with his left hand and now he's one of the GOATs of the sport. Imagine doing something so unnatural and then becoming an all time great."
"I don't see a difference between Pepe/Ramos and Rudiger, in fact both of those actually injured/assaulted players on the pitch.

Rudiger at least hasn't done that **yet**.

At least I commend your self critical nature as a RM fan that's something I can respect, football comes first."
"This reminds me of a popular German meme haha, even though it’s not Swedish 

You should look up „ina Müller Jürgen hurensohn“ on YouTube :D"
"Ehh, fairly sure I've heard some pre-teens and early teens use it over the past years. Maybe it's being used less now. 

Neger on the other hand was never used as an insult when I was younger. The only time I ever heard Neger was when my grandfather talked about how well our black goalkeeper played."
"The same does apply for red cards. Players typically get a longer suspension for a 2nd or 3rd red card of the season. An example this year is Jack stephens who got a 4 match suspension after getting his 2nd red card of the season.

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cx2nlrj4nyvo](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cx2nlrj4nyvo)"
Which would probably be never considering how players like Pepe got away with so much and at the end of the career everyone forgot about it and reminisced about the good old times and how a true legend was retiring.
A two match ban
Could absolutely see him as an Eddie Guerrero style shit heel
I had one before not sure what happened. It is a bit of a further indictment on Rudiger that you couldn't tell which team I meant
"You're right... it wasn't in his chest but in the abdomen [photo](https://www.facebook.com/share/1Ki58ePDQC/)

In fact is even worse because if it was a stomp in the chest, there's the ribcage to protect the vital organs. The abdomen is completely exposed."
Yes... you're right. Didn't remembered it quite well but it's in fact even worse because the lower abdomen is completely exposed.
"yeah i realised as soon as i sent that comment my only experience of Pepe is probably like 5 games lol.

i wonder who is genuinely the dirtiest most piece of shit on the pitch player ever? not off the pitch just onit."
"What an odd point. You didn’t win 3-0 nil and I don’t think you even had that many chances. 
And if City played Rodri you would’ve lost instead squeaking by. We can all make excuses."
">I don't condone body blocks in football 

Oh its a body block now?"
He signed a new contract before leaving to Dortmund which got them enough money to not go under. If he left for free they'd be finished
They did indeed retire Birmingham's number at Bellingham.
"You were a top flight idiot as a teen if you had the same behavior as Bellingham. Not attacking you, just saying Bellingham has a truly despicable attitude"
They literally just put out more or less a reserve side v Real Madrid in league.
"> What do you think would happen to you if you called your boss, co-worker, teacher, a cop etc. Hurensohn? 

Nowhere did OP argue it's a normal, non-controversial word to use. There are many words you wouldn't use in a work environment."
"Hurenson is nearly exactly son of a bitch not only the meaning is very similar but also in the way it's used and heavy/lightness! 

What do you think would happen to you if you called your boss, co-worker, teacher, a cop etc. son of a bitch? 

That's is exactly what I think would happen with Hurensohn"
Can’t argue with that
"Interesting. I was not aware of that, thanks. I guess I have not noticed it since they only tag on an extra game or two and not several months like the Suarez incidents."
Decision appealed.
You lost with Rodri twice against Chelsea in the previous month or two before the UCL final. Sort of had City’s number around that time.
"Blocks / checks, literally the same thing mate.

Try karma farming somewhere else."
"Hes not saying he was like bellingham. Im 36 i work with all ages, honestly any lad und 25 still comes across as a teenager most the time, still immature. Hell i dont even think ive fully matured 😅. He was just saying what i see, no difference between a 19 yr old and a 21 yr old."
They were tired after the rangers game I expect them to do the same against barca if things don't change
No worries! Yeah the severity of the Suarez ban is certainly much larger than any others i'm aware of (outside of gambling and doping bans)
Suspension for the ref
"We weren’t playing how we were the entirety of the season in those two games, in the Prem game we faced you, we had already won the league and viewed the game as an experiment and in the FA Cup game you got lucky.

In the UCL pep didn’t start his DM, and we completely switched up our game plan. Rodri came on and we started playing our way around the 60+ minute mark, and we started being more offensively dominant but by then it was too late. 

Also pep not starting his main DM has bad results throughout his career, 62% of Pep’s losses when he was at Barca,  came when Busquets didn’t play or played less than 15 minutes for example, or in the 2019-20 season where Fernandinho was being played out of position and we started losing or drawing games even then."
"I get it, just saying any « 19 years old kid » with Bellingham attitude would be seen as extra dumb and that’s wouldn’t fly with most people. Can we Stop defending / finding excuses to his behavior? That’s not normal"
10 points from Everton
And a fine for damaging the chair
Probably best posting the last part in a madrid sub.
"It is normal behaviour, in that almost all people express it as part of their development which can be affected by a litany of factors both external and internal, so it's difficult to look at an individual and say they're further ahead or behind than they 'should' be given their age, genetics, and life experiences.

What's ""wrong"", and not normal, is to dismiss or not work on these traits, or to claim they're a better way to be and refuse to acknowledge the impact they have on others and ones self.

I'm honestly surprised when I see wording like 'truly despicable' about a 21 year old who's a talisman for his nation and has been a while, and is dealing with the pressures thereof. When I saw him kicking that monitor stand the other week, it seemed fair to wonder ""Is he frustrated because he's going to get a slew of abuse, a lot of it racial, for this?"" When you google 'Jude Bellingham Racial Abuse' you get results from various dates, and recent examples of racism among Real Madrid's fanbase is well documented.

It seems difficult to see a young man being called 'truly despicable' for getting stressed over mistakes that will, basically for certain, guarantee they get abuse from the malicious and bigoted that's intended to break them down. His general conduct points towards 'hot headedness', but the strength of your wording and the denial of growth or progress in your post doesn't sit right with me."

Rudiger only greeted Ter-Stegen lmao
Rüdiger was QUICK to get through that tunnel lol
Bellingham wasn't interested in any of that. LOL
"Like Hansi said, it's just football, it's a game"
Looks surprisingly wholesome
Vini and Raphinha together wholesome AF ngl
Very weird that Vini was being respectful while Bellingham was acting like a sore loser
this is actually wholesome. i still hate vini and rudiger on the pitch.
Decent attempt at sportsmanship from everyone apart from Bellingham there
Vini was actually very chill here
Why were they giving them a guard of honour? I don’t really get it
I love the rivalry and I love that big chunk of players from both teams respect the shit out of each other when the match is over. Ramos would try to end Messi's career on the pitch but outside of it he would say the nicest things about him. We often forget they are just like us and they are being paid to be the absolute best on the pitch even if that sometimes mean being pure assholes.
what a great game
"Rudiger looks scary, the way he reacted"
This is not a guard of honor but rather walking the gauntlet.
"It’s not even six months ago when it was “Vini bad, Jude class” here. Now it’s almost the opposite.

What happened? I haven’t been watching."
Both clubs respect each other when it matters. Toxic fans can never relate.
"Rivalry is fierce, but respect is even stronger. True sportsmanship from Barça. 👏"
"Isn't the losing side supposed to do this? 

Like the winning side is rubbing it in"
The attitude of Jude.
"Superior class when lower (1-4 loss in 2008) and higher (this time) than them. Props to you, Blaugrana."
"My young son (6) started playing football this year, and I am sick of the amount of toxic behaviour I am seeing in the sport ... Specially just after the game where instead of showing respect and spotmsnship several kids act pissed after losing or mock opponents after winning. 


It's great to be able to show this to him. That what happens in the pitch should stay at the pitch. And that rivals can be good friends.


Props to both teams, specially to the losers who acknowledged (and even hugged) their peers."
"Raphinia with the sunglasses, I love it! 😂"
"kudos to Flick again, that was an absolutely great move to turn around the tone of the whole affair after Rudiger's and Vazquez's madness at the end of the game."
Classy. Loved seeing this. Hope we get to do the same to them next season.
Top 10 respect moments?!?
Wtf is this nonsense
"I’ve been saying this for months. Jude Bellingham is such a prick. Sore loser, didn’t shake anyone’s hand."
Someone needs to show Bellingham the full highlights...guy is becoming an inconsolable crybaby at this point
Where can I get Ralph's sunglasses?
Real Madrid motto - “Work hard in loudness...let your failure be the reason of your silence“
"I love these moments! Even if Madrid's players feel like they are going through the Walk of Shame, it's nice to see that many of them gave respect back."
 No one going to mention the sunglasses…
Imagine if Real was asked to do that.
Bellingham has main character syndrome
"gave a good fight this time, deserved"
It's simple. I used to like Jude. Now I don't.
Why did they give guard of honor?
"We do for them what they would not do for us, rise above, respect"
Every cell in Bellingham’s body looking down
"That's way more than Madrid deserved for being whiny bitches before, during and after the game."
Trolling of the highest order
"More respect than they deserve, manchild squad."
this seems mad awkward. is it CdR tradition?
best time to swing the handbags
More humiliation
"Class act in fairness. 

Rugby do this too. Footy would be far better if the games were more testy but it stayed that way during the 90mins and then that was it."
Great sportsmanship but I don’t know how I would feel as a RM player
Jude knew he fucked up. Modric has regret. Carlo only shook flick hand.
Courtois is the only Madrid player that I've some respect. That guy gives 100% in each match.
"as an Englishman, what a world it is where I now like Courtois a lot more than Jude"
Raphina wearing shirt backwards and also with subglasses is kinda “disrespectful” compared to everyone else.
"Ok…I’ll put my pride aside, and say respect to Barcelona team. Exceptional competitors."
Thanks Luka
"gave a good fight this time, deserved"
Does this always happen after Spanish cup finals?
"Can someone explain why Barca was giving them the guard of honor ? Shouldn’t it be the other way around since Barca will probably win the league ?

Genuine question- not trying to be rile anyone up."
Bellingham fuckin baby
Wait wtf is this a thing?
"I'm not sure why Bellingham is getting so much stick?!  You don't need to shake everyone's hand, hug, kiss etc. You walk through, that's it. Why are they even getting one!"
"The way people hating on Bellingham here youd think he walked through that guard tunnel spitting in the face of Barca players. Him not wanting anything to do with that is not bad. Y'all gone fucking soft, redditors."
"Shows how much of an impact adrenaline has. Most users of this subreddit haven’t played any sport let alone football in their life since they were in junior school, so don’t know what impact it has."
Why is that silly little right back hanging around every game like an irrelevant groupie
Why did they give a guard of honour to this disgrace of a club and after all that happened tonight?
"Kill them with kindness, those Real Madrid players must be pulling on every ounce of self control to not crash out."
"Barcelona players clapping for Real players as they go onto the stage to collect the loser's medal. 

Iykyk."
They don’t deserve it.
This is embarrassing. Im new to soccer why do they do this
"What mostly pisses me off is Raphina wearing sunglasses, ffs man you fuckin diva, take them off"
"To be honest if I was him, I wouldn't come back to the field on the night. Embarrassing. Dude needs reflective practice."
Man was dying from embarrassment
Literally what a fucking baby he is
Why only twe stegen
Only acknowledged his national team mate
There's not many players I actually dislike as a person but he's definitely one of them. Still convinced he broke KdB's face on purpose in the CL final when he was at Chelsea.
Probably because he didn’t deserve it after his abhorrent behaviour.
Hearing him say at half time that all the 50/50 decisions go to Barca… not surprised. Bit of a child.
Toxic Kids ..
walking in a guard of honor as a loser when your standards are very high. imagine how would that make you feel
"Tbf as the only Englishman there, he probably doesn't have as much to relate to unlike the other players

Kinda reminds me of a certain Welsh ex-footballer..."
"This was really nice actually. 

Very entertaining game btw. Congrats on the W. "
"That's the craziest part of this whole shit for me. This Barca team/manager seem to be doing absolutely nothing to provoke RM, yet they are absolutely losing it. And Barca are just there, doing nothing except play good football and being chill. So weird."
https://youtube.com/watch?v=PTkHT6UHqkI
Not it’s really not. Livelihood is on the line
"When adrenalin is out of the body, most people can think clearly without anger. This is a good example - obviously Real players didn’t like the situation, but they took it professionaly here."
"""Thanks for coming, see you again next month where we will add to this season's 12-4 aggregate score"""
For someone new to Spanish football - does this happen every Copa Del Rey final wherein the winning team gives the guard of honour to the losing team?
"Exactly what I was thinking, looked rather civilized lol"
Thought it was from a different match
Rugby does this every single game at every level.
"I was expecting some shithousery, good on all of them"
He's usually class outside the 90 minutes on the pitch so I'm not that surprised lol
"Vini is by all accounts a very chill guy off the pitch. Maintains good relations with several Barcelona players, including Araujo - Araujo speaks Portuguese for anyone unaware, as he grew up right on the border with Brazil, where they mostly speak Portunhol. As long as it's not about the Ballon d'Or, Vini seems like a very composed and humble guy off the pitch."
"Mad headloss from Jude, people keep saying he's always like this but this is something different. Maybe he's just a bit of a cunt, maybe a long season being injured and doing all the work for the attackers has taken its toll, or maybe it's just the Madrid bug. Who knows

It's very entertaining anyway"
"Vini always seems like a decent guy tbh, just easily rattled"
"Idk even as a Barça fan, he gets under my skin sometimes but I don’t hate him. Fun player to watch who plays with flair and passion, and sometimes petulant, but he gets a lot of unnecessary shit for this combined with the color of his skin which is bs. Football is less fun without players like him. Just wish he didn’t play for Madrid"
Not surprising considering Bellingham has always been a sore loser and a manchild
Vini actually seems alright outside of the (within the upper end of normal perameters) pitch theatrics. The Ballon D'or thing was apparently a RM call not Vini. Bellingham kinda seems like a brat.
"Vini is a complete 180 off the pitch. Bellingham is the one who is a cunt ""in real life"" too."
That might just be the difference in age
That's bullshit. Rudiger should be hated off the pitch too.
Rudiger is a thug
"Vini's just a windup on the pitch, Rudiger on the other hand is a cunt on and off."
And Rüdiger. He ignored everyone except Ter Stegen.
I'd say Fede was even better look at him
Is say not lashing out while your blood is boiling is pretty fair sportsmanship ngl
"To his defense he was the most gutted player and was beyond davestated.. He plays with his whole heart i mean literally very ounce of it he needs time to recover.. He has great attitude overall but his very competitive in game performance this keeps him sharp and plays with his whole heart everytime hence losses hurt more then others..

Some players really get immersed  and play with their whole heart in order to perform at high levels he is like that. A win will take him to cloud nine and a loss would devastate him emotionally and will need atleast 3 days to get over it.

To be honest I am like that somewhat. I used to get really involved whole heartedly when I use to play in youth level. I felt losses deeper then others because I was about that life emotionally."
He always is when the game is not going
"Same, anyone got the answer? Seems unnecessary"
"Sarcasm.

Jk, just good sportsmanship and respect. The contrast between this show of class, versus Real’s farcical behaviour towards the end, is also extremely ironic"
"Scary my balls

Bullies like him aren't scary. They can only hurt you if you let them hurt you."
"Yeah, he looked psychotic."
Cherry picked clips of Jude off the pitch were posted on the subreddit when he first joined Real that made him seen mature for his age. People who follow the Bundesliga have known he was like this way before he moved to La Liga
Real Madrid regularly refuse to give Barca a guard of honour tho
"It's easy to show good sportsmanship after you win. Definitely not saying Barca players are poor sports, but this is more a testament to some Real Madrid players' qualities (not Bellingham lol)."
"It actually feels better when you win and do it for the loser side than the loser side does it for you. It's like you're trolling, saying gg or something."
Isn't it the same when the runners up are walking up the stage to get their medals?
Real Madrid could never do this. Whether on the winning or losing side.
"He was one of our best players out there today. What highlights does he need to be shown? 

Also referring to him walking through the guard without interacting with anyone as “becoming an inconsolable crybab” is comical"
I think it’s the old Oakley Romeo (or Juliet) glasses. They are very rare and cost a shitload of money.
"I mean barca and madrid clearly need each other. It's bad for both of them if they're too dominant. And they obviously are from similar countries. Tchoumeni, kounde, mbappe. Vini,rodrygo, endrick, raphinha are all good friends off the pitch. Laporta and perez need each other too evidenced by the super league."
"unbelievable honestly. Lost a final and they expect him to be smiling and hugging. What the actual fuck.
People trying to find everything to hate him. Just walking is cunt behavior now apparently."
"Tee Stegen is literally doing the same for Barça? Same as Militão, and today you had all the injured players from both sides on the pitch during breaks"
true why is the second captain pretending he's part of the team
You aren't the one to decide that
agreed. if you ask anyone what the best el clasico era. the answer is pep vs mourinho.
"He's 32. It's a bit late for it to benefit football, but hopefully he can see a therapist for his family. He has no rage control."
"If he hadn't come, that would have been his first step towards redemption."
Same with Vini sort of. At least he shook everyone’s hand
The lack of criticism he got for that was shocking. Instead everyone laughed at KDB for crying when it was a pretty gruesome injury. 
"He was pretty mild at Chelsea, I'm just surprised how he dialed it up to 11 at RM.
That challenge though I agree should have been a red. Everyone knew it was intentional."
How that wasn’t a red it was insane to me
He's always been a prick. He was the same in Germany aswell.
"I mean he is one? We criticize these guys for being hot headed but they’re 20 year olds. I’m 43 and the guy working for me (24) looks like a kid that needs constant direction to me. 

And he doesn’t have to deal with fame and that getting to his head."
"He said 50/50s, not 50/50 decisions.

He was most likely talking about how they were getting overrun by not winning enough challenges."
I kinda understand this sentiment from HIS pov. In general I don't agree. The referee was really fair. But allowed the players to play very hard. Jude was probably the one who suffered the most from this. There were countless of cases when he was fouled (or what would count as a foul in most of the games). Not even a big Bellingham fan but I hate to see such a collective negative hive mind narrative against him. He was by far Madrid's best player that night.
It comes from the top
I heard that as him having a go at his team mates for losing all their 50/50 battles
"But it's barca, it's not like they lost to some sunday league team"
"Courtois was also the only Belgian there, and he interacted with everyone - even if it was very mild."
Checks username
"Fr it was a game worthy of a final, on the edge till the end."
"Game was brilliant as a neutral, really enjoyed it"
"Reminds me of their 5-0 win back in the prime days. Zero provocation and pure football, and then just RM players trying to kill Messi and Ramos doing his ""thing"" to Puyol igniting the fiasco"
"To be fair to Madrid, it's easy to be the good guy when winning and the manager sets the right tone.

For all the talk about how Ancelloti is a gentleman, he should enforce more discipline on his players. His hands though are likely tied by the board."
"I think it speaks to the massive pressure Real Madrid players are under. When things are going well it’s all “I want to retire at this club”, but when it’s not and the fans are baying for blood, the players and the club infrastructure put a lot of energy into finding any reasons but themselves behind losing"
"I mean most of the players know at least one player on the other team from their national teams, so there’s a little less animosity.

Bit humiliating when you’ve just lost a cup final, but a nice gesture nonetheless. 

Barca has just been better over the season, it’s the way football works. Hopefully we finish strong and come back stronger next season."
"Apologies if not a propos, but I’ve participated in a few martial arts tournaments, and right after the last fight ends, the adrenaline goes down super quickly, and it’s super weird…I  just wanted to be friends with the guy i fought?"
"I honestly feel that giving the guard of honor would feel unsettling and may be a jerk move to the losing team. Madrid players actually took it well. If I lost, I would rather be left alone."
"I don't think so. At least I don't remember it, but maybe it's less eye-catching when it's not a Classico"
That’s dope! As a barca fan I’ve always hated him on the pitch but seeing him here he looks like a good lad
And Araujo's mom is Brazilian
"I once talked to him before a match, he's does seem like a very cool guy which makes me sad when he gets all the hate that he gets, and won't say it's all undeserved of course, but sometimes it's just too much."
"> As long as it's not about the Ballon d'Or

Maybe all that shit was more caused by the club than him, it's hard to know from the outside. Personally I think it probably was, because I doubt a 24 year old, no matter how good, can just have a tantrum and make the whole club boycott the ceremony when they had won other awards. I think it came from the top."
He has always been a cunt you just didn't notice it as much when he was at dortmund because dortmund gets 1% of the attention madrid gets
You can take the man out of Birmingham City but...
Yeah always had a lot of respect for Jude but today just made me think he’s a whiner
He is still 21 lol
"That wish may become reality pretty soon, considering his wage demands"
"Very frustrating that he gets so much racist abuse. He should absolutely get abuse, but for being an insufferable cunt not for being black. Haven't watched a single game with him in it where he's behaved normally."
"chelsea fans are still angry at the club for… not willing to negotiate with his agent after the guy literally blackmailed marina lmao 

idk"
"Ugh, now I remembered the incident from training when he bullied their staff member. Disgusting person."
"I'd say Fede is probably our most chill squad member, he's universally loved for a reason after all

But he's also very passionate about Real Madrid so I would understand if he still felt very upset about losing, which is the vibe I'm getting from this"
That's the bare fucking minimum of sportsmanship what are you on about
Let’s not justify him being a bad loser here.
"Nah, he's just a dick here.

Wdym he's the only one gutted here?
Mbappe started it all and was almost on the verge of equalising if not for that offside.

Everyone was equally gutted. The only difference is the other players including Vinicius Jr knew it's just a football game and embraced the defeat after the full time whistle.

Who would have thought a locker room that has Vini Mbappe and Rudiger, Bellingham would be the biggest diva."
"Na. He’s just a little sore loser bitch. 

A guy who plays with his whole heart doesn’t miss a pass and stand there with his hands on his head while the other team go and score lmao"
"Fede, Fran, a lot of the team played with heart. Doesn’t excuse being petulant after full time."
They want him to congratulate everyone while he just played rhe game of his life to lose at the last minute. Little things that reddit cares about is insane
Or a Balon D'Or isn't going.
Vini is probably the only Brazilian who seems like he looks after his fitness off the field
"It often happens in finals, you show respect to the team that got second place. Happens in pretty much every cup competition"
"True, ngl i might be soft, weak man irl."
"What? It feels better to win? no shit

Losing and doing that is much harder. Cuz you just wanna run in the locker room and cry after"
"No man he was crying to refs all game, showing dissent to every decision like a crybaby. He was best as per your standards though....."
Watch the entire first goal and not just the highlights. Embarrassing.
Yeah literally nothing wrong with it. TerStegen was in the squad tho tbf. But he still does it other games when he isn’t. They are literally the captains.
I stand corrected. It would be more relevant if the second captain wasn't constantly acting like an irrelevant fan girl groupie
"I don't know really. He could go on a retreat after the club world cup and become a pleasant professional footballer that continues to succeed. Don't have to be a brute to win. Tough and aggressive sure but stamping, fighting and throwing shit at refs can be treated alright. He would have to commit. As he is a Muslim (not sure how he practices it personally, whatever about as a footballer). He may approach the break as a path to relaxing, being peaceful and learning the true path to excellence."
"If Pepe was able to become human, so will he."
Oh yeaaa. I forgot that.
Nah Vini was fine here
"nah Bellingham was worse lol, Vini seemed like a good sport here"
"Don't think you can criticise Vinicius here - he actually took the time to shake the hands of one line of Barcelona players, unlike Bellingham and Rudiger who basically just walked through without acknowledging them"
"Bro Vini was the only guy looking at the Barca players instead of trying to ignore them liks the rest of the team.

You people will literally try anything to demonize the guy."
The Vini hate is getting ridiculous atp.
"Vini is an ass; but here he is behaving as a good sportsmen, shaking hands, acknowledging his rivals, and hugging his friends/colleagues.


Spotless"
Damn you bias af
"They are the same people who laughed at Salah when Ramos literally did a waki-gatame on his arm. It’s not surprising coming from them, they regularly laugh at such things."
"Probably because of some toxic masculinity bullshit yeah. ""Men shouldn't show softness"" etc, which seems to be ripe amongst younger football fans."
He was very good after Tuchel came in. Was always pretty inconsistent before that.
I like him for the national team but also hated Pepe. National team pride puts in the blinders. But he’s a knob. But he’s our knob.
I think the injury changed the course of the match. City lost the edge.
Mad that he was that much of a dick that even his team mates in Germany acknowledged it publicly
The way he goes out of his way to look like a great guy just makes him even more unlikeable
Mason Greenwood's friend being a prick.. suprised
Tbf he was like 17 there
"Great perspective.

Fellow old here. Like you, I'm not old enough to be a boomer, but I'm old enough that someone Bellingham's age would call me a boomer.

24 year old me was an arrogant moron. Old me is still a moron, but less arrogant and relatively much less of a moron.

Most of the people reading this are probably 24 or younger. They probably don't fully realize how people can change over time, because they have yet to experience that change themselves.

Bellingham has super human maturity in terms of his work ethic and drive. He clearly has subhuman levels in other aspects of maturity. Which is fine.

He had his number retired as a teenager. He will likely mature with time. Hopefully the response to his actions here will get him down the path to being more humble.

He's a football genius. Still a dumb kid. For now."
"Their age has nothing to do with their hot-headed was. They're celebs who are treated like gods and the slightest obstacle to success sends them off. Rudiger is one of their seniors and he's the most hot-headed out of the lot.

It's actually every factor except for age."
Does he insult you/ throw a tantrum when things don’t go his way tho?
I’m 32 and a guy working for me (35) acts like someone needing constant direction. Age is no doubt a factor but some people just don’t mature properly
"Yeah, some may think it's a reach, but to me it definitely seemed like he was more frustrated with himself and the team than the referee"
They still lost
He's been there for like a decade.
What he do?
"I believe the feeling is even stronger in combat sports, because once the adrenaline goes you're kind of reminded that your opponent is going through the same struggles, pain and sacrifice as you do, so the feeling of respect and mutual understanding usually takes over. That was my experience when I was doing Taekwondo tournaments and being always a bit terrified of getting my face destroyed by a kick lol"
"If Vini wasn’t such a crybaby on the pitch, he would be much more liked all around, specially in Spain.

He is a great lad and an incredible player, but once he steps on the turf, the long leash he has by playing for Madrid allows him to act like a prick."
"Agreed. He can be infuriating on the pitch and the bdo saga was cringe, but there's so many fucking outright racists just bashing him with or without reason and without any limits or decency, it's disgusting."
ONE PERCENT
"Oh no I'm well aware of it after we knocked them out of the UCL, his meltdown then was what you'd expect from someone who was practically still a kid and had a cunty side to him. And this whole debacle is 10x worse than that was"
"At least someone else noticed. I couldn't stand the coverage of him, especially during the euros. ""Oh he's so humble, he's so mature"". It's like they've never watched him, he's an egotistical, spoiled little brat"
Completely understandable being upset after a loss to your rival let alone in a cup final
"Raphinha, Allison are a joke to you?"
This is certainly a take
"...Raphinha, our Ballon d'Or winner."
"Doing the guard of honour to the winners is a bit redundant, they've already won and the extra honour from the team they beat matters rather little. Doing it to the losing team shows the winners' respect and that they acknowledge the skill of their opponents who gave their best on the pitch"
And why should any Madrid fan care about your opinion? Jude was our best player and Im very happy how he played. Second season and he is 21 and performing better than experienced regulars.
I watched the entire game mate. Yea he didn’t track back but Ceballos was caught ball watching and also left the top of the box open
tbf i didn’t know Ter Stegen was in the squad but yeah they’re literally the captains and they’re still players for that team even if they’re injured. Except for things like that Carvajal incident with Saka there’s literally no harm in them being there
"Bellingham was acting the way I've seen English players act after losing international finals. They sulk (which is understandable), and after getting their medal, take it off instantly. To me, that shows a lack of respect and sportsmanship. By all means, you can be disappointed and devastated from losing, that's totally fair, but have some fucking grace in defeat as well."
">Rudiger who basically just walked through without acknowledging them

If that dude is even a little bit normal, I can't imagine the level of cringe he might be feeling after the emotions wore off"
Was Bellingham this much of a sourpuss at Dortmund or is it something he's developed at Madrid?
"Yeah, Vini gets along well with a lot of them, some people think just cause your rival teams you can’t be friends with the opponent"
He threw things at the referee. He doesn't get nearly enough hate
Ramos also deliberately hurt the Liverpool keeper in that game. 
Because he's a terrorist and Tuchel plays terrorist football
"They said mild, not mid. the comment wasn't regarding his footballing ability."
The German John Terry
I mean there’s literally video evidence of him calling his Dortmund teammates cunts on the pitch lmao
The guy who called Mason Greenwood a rapist in game is his friend?
Is he still friends with Greenwood?
Atleast Foden seems like a good egg and removed himself from Greenwood.
Wtf did Mason Greenwood get charged with exactly?
Sub human? 😂 Seems a bit much
"Yep, my thoughts exactly. I really didn’t lose that shit until I was 24/25 and did some awful stuff in my late teens / early twenties.

Once people start hitting 26/27 and still have the attitude then I’d start to worry a little."
"Ye, your brain isn't even fully developed before you are 24-25 years old.


Everyone are more or less idiots when we are young and we all have said and done stupid immature things in our late teens and early 20th. But also most people grow up and learn.


I my self cringe so hard for things I've said and wish to back in time and smack my self in the head."
"I mean i feel like it's also not as obnoxious as people are putting it out there, sure he complains, hell half the people on this sub would probably complain when playing a sports video game.

People get competitive, the best players are always arrogant, people get annoyed on the pitch and sometimes they blurt out how they're currently feeling from their own perspective. We're obviously sitting at home on a sofa watching and it's really easy to nitpick when someone says something."
Great comment and there’s no allowance for this in the media. Imagine if every comment you made outside your house between the ages of 17 and 35 was available for public consumption! It’s a nightmare and to be fair he’s doing a lot better that I would have that’s for sure 🤣
He's not been tested with immense fame money etc though. Those things are blessings and burdens at the same time.
"Anyone with eyes could see that Barca were always a step ahead in the first half and were dominating them.

People see anti-referee bias in everything because they they're specifically looking for it."
"yea, plus that isn't what you'd say if you were complaining about a referee, you wouldn't be complaining about ""50/50 decisions"""
To Barcelona
"It was just about shaking hands with players who were giving you a guard of honor. Not that deep. Arda interacted with everyone too, and he's the only Turkish dude there."
He's a Madridian
[This](https://youtu.be/kXvvJ2llO_U?si=KHZvXqI13uJbpJay)
"In endurance sports too. You know everyone else suffered as much as you, so you can only respect it if they still managed to push more. No tricks or lucks, just shared suffering."
"It's also because you don't actually hate the other guy and it's all a sport, not a war."
Imagine scrolling through a reddit post and you get a random stray
I’m not sure it’s even that much tbh.
"Trust me, you guys don't want my attention. The only time you get my attention, your best player about to move to Bayern."
">...Raphinha, our Ballon d'Or winner.

Oh when did he win that ?"
Is this a tradition? I swear this is the first I've seen this. Maybe I should watch more trophy ceremonies lmao
Who mentioned you madrid fans??? He was talking about Bellingham only…
"Idk - different strokes for different folks. To me taking off the medal is reflective on they feel, as to not earning the right to wear a medal. 

As with most sports if you’re not first then you’re merely the first one to lose. The second place medal isn’t a badge of honour, it’s a pin of shame."
"He was, but he’s gotten much worse at Madrid"
There were reports of him having ego problems at Dortmund as well https://www.fearthewall.com/2023/8/17/23835027/discontent-strain-relations-bellingham-teammates-bvb-mentality-dortmund-bundesliga-real-madrid but coming to Madrid and early success prolly made it worse
"I think it's an English thing tbh, in both of the last Euros finals, several of the players were acting similarly to Bellingham. The prime example for me is taking off their medal instantly after receiving it."
He gets plenty
But but he’s the greatest cb of all time for taking paneka pens
Ruined his career.
Same goes for that aswell tbf. His shithousery stepped up multiple levels once Tuchel came in and his form improved.
He was running on fumes to carry Dortmund over the line and win the league but his teammates still capitulated. I'm no huge fan of him but can we really blame him?
Lol and it is upvoted quite a bit as well
"I don’t think so, wasn’t there that drama last year where he called greenwood a rapist and la liga got lip readers for it?"
"We've all heard the recording and seen and pictures. We know he broke bail conditions to meet her and coerce her into refusing to cooperate. We all know her piece of shit father backed him because he cares more about money then his daughter. ""He wasn't charged"" isint the gotcha you think it is. I hope you're a child because you have room to grow"
"oh look, here comes the guy defending a rapist"
"If you genuinely don’t know what happened, there’s an audio of him abusing his girlfriend and forcing her into having sex with him (rape)."
"If I punched you in the face, but you decided not to press charges, did I still punch you in the face?"
"He was CHARGED with attempted rape and controlling & coercive behaviour

He wasn't convicted of these, because the UK is far too soft on crimes like his. No protection for the victim."
Google is your friend
Fair. Below average is more accurate. I was contrasting my also calling him superhuman.
😂Like seriously referring to anyone as subhuman over a game of football would have me questioning that persons maturity
ur acting like losing in a final is good especially to ur rivals
"Not disagreeing with you dude. As much as I like Bellingham, he acts like a petulant child."
"lol come on, you think FCB giving a guard of honor in this situation is a chore or a sign of respect? it’s the biggest flex in football I’m amazed they do it.."
Yeah Borussia who?
He has a solid chance this season I guess
"I totally disagree with that. In most sports, they wear silver and bronze medals with pride, even if they are disappointed to lose the gold."
"Well.. You probably don't know this but once you become a Madrid player it gives you leeway to treat people the way you want to, commit the fouls you want to and think no one will touch you.. You can ask Ramos, Casemiro and even Ancelotti when they were playing in the opposite team.. You won't believe the amount of power Florentino has in that league."
"That's not an English thing. See: CR7, Harland, Lewandowski..."
The amount of shit you can get away with saying when it fits the mood of the thread lmao
"Oh yeah, so can’t really knock him for being his friend when they were teenagers  if he dropped him after the allegations came out."
Why is everyone immediately thinking he has ill intentions with his comment? Not everybody follows football all the time. Assuming people have bad intentions all the time aint a nice way to go through life.
"Not fair to blame the UK justice system here (usually, just not here). The victim declined to take it any further, the prosecution would not have been in the public interest without her because it would inevitably have failed at court.

I still feel he should have been charged with witness tampering, since he was forbidden to go near her and he got near enough for her to become pregnant with his baby. She either got intimidated out of pursuing it further, or paid off."
"It's not, but it's not like they didn't put in the effort. Only one team was going to win the copa, it's always unfair but that's sports I guess"
He’s an ultra competitive 21 year old who is constantly told he’s one of the best footballers in the world. It would be a miracle if he didn’t behave like a petulant child.
Mönchen Gladbach
Borussia BLOODCLAT-YANG
Most people would then say „candidate“
"Raul ascensio is on the same path too, I see a future ramos style player in him"
Pretty sure he also killed the pope!!!
"I don't think anyone said they were friends as teenagers. Can't recall seeing the two together.

The only story I've ever seen was that Getafe's coach said Greenwood ""went to Getafe because he's friends with Bellingham"". Bellingham's team said they're unhappy with such a thing and asked to refrain the statement, and Bodalas did, saying ""yeah someone told me that Greenwood talked to Bellingham about it, that's all I said... but it didn't happen"". 

But, if it fits the story (like here), I guess some people still get the memory of the two being BFFs."
"My apologies but its just the wording, it imo comes off horribly, asking what mason greenwood did is one thing. Asking wht he was charged with is a catchphrase that was very popular online and still is popular as a 'hes not charged so hes innocent"" rebuttal. Perhaps i overreacted or perhaps he was implying Greenwood wasnt charged and is therefor innocent."
"The fact he managed to visit and get her pregnant, while (in my opinion) getting her to drop the charges, proves a failure of our system. There is not enough protection for victims of offenders like this. I agree he should have been charged with tampering. But there were absolutely failures to protect her"
"Ah okay, thanks for clarifying."
"I wouldve had the same reaction if he said convicted instead of charged, charged is what the police wants to convict him of, convicted is what he was found guilty/innocent of, atleast that is how my English teacher explained it back in the day. I may be wrong as English aint my first language"
"Ah well misunderstanding then, English isint my first either 😂"

He is truely 17
Is he gonna keep stacking the sunglasses each big win? 
What is bro wearing 😭
Yeah that’s a teenager alright lmao
"I love Yamal speaking Catalan 😍

Here's my full translation:

> *Talking with Ronald at the hotel, I told him: if they score one goal, it doesn't matter. If they score two, it doesn't matter. Because this year they can't beat us — we've shown it. We are very happy. Visca el Barça!*"
Eminem is sure confident
"Getting clowned on by a 17 year old with that hair, nah the heads are going to mars"
fucking hilarious. this is like me after winning fifa on amateur
"2 sunglasses, braces, backwards shirt, blond hair

He has too much aura"
talk that fucking talk sonny
"I hate how much I like this kid 

At least I get to cheer for him a few weeks a year"
Lamine Yamal? That's Doflamingo
2 assists from him today
Madrid fans are having a generational headloss on social media after seeing this lmao
"Yo this kid is smug af, I love it. Game's back"
Always backing it up my goat
Careful or rudiger might throw another bottle
Man (boy) has enough confidence for the entire squad.
I like that he's a lil cocky - reminds me of neymar.
"haha look at the cool-ass mf with them shades 

let’s fucking goooooooooo"
Peak shithouser. My young 🐐
"Bleached hair ✅ 

Backwards jersey ✅ 

Two pairs of sunglasses ✅✅ 

Roasting Madrid ✅ 


Love it"
"Let his age nor talent ever be in question, my cringe king"
"what's that drip LMAO

God bless his soul, he truly is a kid"
Some Denis Rodman vibes
Aight man well your hair looks awful (I’m coping so hard with this loss)
"This is either gonna age great, or very very bad"
I really wish he didn’t say that. This is the type of story where memes emerge.
keep being confident like this for next 20 years my guy🙏
"He is 17 , euro winner and played amazing against madrid 3 times this season, of course he is gonna talk shit he is a kid. You lot at 30+ brag over your friends when you beat them at fifa"
Yamin Lamal Mvp
It sure would help Real Madrid if they didn't concede 12 in 3 matches.
I love seeing players in the game that have sky high confidence and god level ability. They just carry themselves differently and don’t give a shit. I’ve missed players like Yamal in the game
It's giving Dennis Rodman when he joined the NWO.
The kid has Anime protagonist flair.
You only get a few opportunities to twist the dagger. Nicely done
Dressed like he's auditioning for the Mean Girls sequel.
"This 17 year old kid played 132 minutes tonight, 2 assists and still providing amazing passes in extra time. Unbelievable!"
You Smoke Too Tough. Your Swag Too Different. They’ll Kill You
Can't even be mad at this lmao
He ain’t wrong 😔
Rudiger must be fuming that he got deatroyed by a 17 year old
"Like I said earlier today, nobody can talk shit to Lamine. He will be there to make sure his team lifts trophies."
"I like this no of the fake humble, I want players to show personality "
"Freaking hell Yamal, Anulo Mufa"
I have to admit that this look is amazing
this is hilarious
Yea he going to need another bleaching session to get rid of the orange crap. Hope he waits long enough or that hair won’t recover lol.
Drip too hard
Bro is not cooking with that haircut
Looks like a joker to me 😅
"Yamale looks like he just came out of a discoteca — 
If he could even get into one based on his age"
The “modern galacticos” getting dicked around by a kid. You can’t help but smile lmao
true gangsta lmao
this is giving lil jon vibes. WHAAAAT!?!?!?!
"I think people keep forgetting that he's still just 17. I love that the kid is saying what he wants and looking like he is lmao. Might it come back to bite him later? Sure, but these types of things are great for the game."
high meme potential with the double glasses
I love him and my team but I'm also superstitious and I wish he would say that after we have all the silver 😮‍💨
Confidence level: 100%.
Game's back
Should be the new dynamic image for a copa special FC 25 card
this guys is the real deal. after watching some barca matches I can say this. he’s generational
This kid 😂😂 fucking hilarious
"he’s super good can’t deny that, just very talented and you know this guy is one with the ball, the kind of player who controls the ball gracefully just like Neymar, but the attitude, well he’s just a teenager I guess"
I love this kid so much
"actual remontada vs Lemontada🍋 
He is not wrong though "
"I see this, and I can't help but think that this is just how my sister's friends and my sister herself (all 17 years old) behave haha, well, only they are not as successful as Lamine, but I mean, that's exactly how teenagers are bought, no matter the context! hahaha"
"Kid lost 3 straight clasicos in his first year and now won 3 straight congrats 

Can’t wait to see what he says when Barca goes through an inevitable slump"
I love you Yamal but feet firm on the ground. We Barca fans want 10 years of victories not just one for that we need Messis Xavis and Puyols rather than Neymars.
"Bro dunked on mbappe 4 times in a row 

He gotta shit talk"
Anulo mufa!!!!
anulo that mufa lamine
"This kid talks too much. Well as long as he's backing it up with big game performances, fair game"
This is glorious
"Yes, that is pretty cool… [but it’s not even in the same league of cool as Ryan Fitzpatrick after *that* game…](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F0aE5VUZIY)"
This year definitely
This kid cures my depression and I am not even a barca fan
"Key words being ""this year""."
"As a Madrid fan, my head is gone. But fairs. Perhaps we’ll be a better team next season."
The real question is how many pairs of sunglasses he needs
This kid is phenonmenal!!
"Damn, would ya believe they got him for free?"
"Talk your shit, king"
The backwards shirt lmao I love it
"Can’t complain, he still a child"
These sunglasses and Travis Scott sponsor I beg
"He’s so good, legit a threat every time he has the ball. Just feels like he’s gonna make magic every time"
Is that a wig or his actual hair
Yo dawg we heard you like sunglasses
"This year, when all our defense is injured 😂"
My boy out here looking like a Willie brother
"Close enough, welcome back Dennis Rodman"
"If you didnt know his age, you would know after seeing him here lmao"
Didn't know Rodman started playing football.
"Considering how close it was, and that there's another clasico coming up, he might just have jinxed them lol."
He sells sunglasses on the side?
fucking savage from a 17 year old 😂
Fucking king. Dunking on madrid while 17 and looking like that
Imagine if Vini said that last year lol
He is 1 year older than me but he has so much aura
"Carles Puyol would never allow such behavior. He knew you don't poke the bear and give them Billboard material. 

I miss Puyol...hes class and brought so much respect to the club."
"How does one say, ""Tell me when I'm telling lies!"" in Spanish?"
"Pathetic behaviour from us today. On the other side, theres something in winning with grace that Barcelona lacks."
Lewis Skelly will humble this lad
Look at the state of him.
Deserved win and a brilliant player but just know that this talk will bite back the first moment things arent going as well.
"Lmfaooooo. Disrespectful AF, I'm pretty sure Madrid is going to crunch them next time they meet later this year haha"
Let's be honest if vini said that the reaction would be different. Let's still be honest we Real Madrid really hit the low this season. Finishing second in almost everything in national
congrats your club is bankrupt
"He'd be 10000% more likeable if he didn't become such an arrogant prick at 17.

This is why even as a RM fan I still hold guys like Messi and Iniesta in the highest regards, cause they aren't sore losers, and remain class no matter how much they win.

Enjoy your early boom, player's with big mouths like this don't last long.

Last dude who tried to talk smack after beating Madrid was Mason Mount, and we all saw how that turned out"
"People forget how Yamal was crying on the pitch when he lost the cup to Real Madrid last year, congrats to Barca but remember, el classico is a circle of repeating, last year we won all the el classico’s now it’s Barca turn to destroy Real Madrid, it is what it is.

That’s why i always stay humble, this will backfire on Yamal too, i doubt it would be this season since half of our defence is injured but it will, always does. 

Embarrassing behaviour from our team today, i hope Perez would act in the summer because Ancelotti lost the dressing room totally."
"Oh man, Barcelona will face them in the Champions and will be kicked out.


Edit: downvotes for saying he is spitting upwards?"
He wasn't great today.
I'll be there to remind you.
Generational
"He had a party that got out of hand, but his sunglasses are legendary so no he won't take them off."
It's a canon event. Every teenager has to go through cringe phase
And I love to see it
big if true
he’s too cool to be 17
Can’t wait to watch him lift the champions league trophy with 4 pairs of sunglasses on
Mfker met the king of Spain like that lmaooo my baby goat
lookin like tyler the creator
He wore stacked sun glasses when he shook hands with the King.
https://i.imgur.com/HW4yrZy.gif
Reminds me of the meme of Tom Hardy's hat from Taboo. People kept make his hat taller and taller with every subsequent post.
"I can't even comment because any time I come across a picture of my teenage years my whole fucking body seizes up in embarrassment. 

I'm sure he'll come across this video in 30 years and laugh."
"I think it's the glasses from supercopa trophy.

So I guess he might end up wearing 4 pair by end of it."
"Are you questioning his choices of eye wear, the medal or his shirt on backwards?"
he lowkey got that shit on idk what ur talking abt 😭
He looks like Doflamingo from one piece
unless you're also a teenager you're too old to comment.
It's reaching Stephen Ireland driving a pink range rover with a toupee levels ...
What is literally anyone in the background wearing 
https://c.tenor.com/paThAJSWjLAAAAAC/tenor.gif
He’s a teenager after all we all dressed cringey at that age
No need to verify his age
I was expecting Spanish and was wondering why I was having such a hard time understanding him lol
"He is Catalan, no?"
"I love to hear it. Don’t speak Catalan but I’ve never seen why Spanish speakers have such a hard time understanding it. I find it wicked easy. As a Basque I chuckle when monolingual spanish speakers freak out about not understanding Catalan, like you’d think it’s Euskara the way they act lol"
"Visca Barça, visca Lamine Yamal, visca Catalunya"
I wish we could hear him speaking catalan often :D
My boy is still traumatized by that red card blunder by Araujo last season lmaooo
Did he grow up speaking Spanish or mainly Catalan?
Slim Shadesy
Why wouldn’t he be? He bodied entitled Madrid all year.
"Perez, get ready to learn Martian buddy."
But he is the most talented 17 year old ever after Pele
Exactly the same xD
Sagged shorts and a huge smile
He and Kounde drip way too hard.
He's turning into a JoJo character right in front of our eyes
Whats wrong with braces 😭
"No wonder Messi gave bath to him.

Man saw the future."
And 2 assists
"Generational talent no doubt but have to disagree on the aura, comes off as trying too hard to be like his idol Neymar and cringy"
It's beautiful to see someone that has Ronaldo's confidence and Messi's ability
Cuckatron 3000 in the building
Dressrosa literally looks like Barcelona soooo
"Culers are evil? Madridistas are righteous? These terms have always changed throughout the course of history! Kids who have never seen peace and kids who have never seen war have different values!

"meanwhile... ESPN Commentators....

""Lamine Yamal, really hasn't done much really has he? Not yet anyways... 101'st Minute""

""Lamine Yamal, very quiet tonight, someone we expected to be a difference maker"""
Club and players too. Absolute joke of a club.
The IG posts make me feel safe because you know theyre being followed by a cooking session
Real Madrid do love a good bottle this year
and also the braces
he only said this year
"I mean they’ve beaten them 3 times already with 12 scored against them in total. It’ll very likely be 4 times by the end of the season too.

Has every right to be confident atp"
"There’s still 2 games with them remaining this year (at minimum), isn’t it?

EDIT: Wait, if it’s “this year” as in this season… Yeah, guess I’m stupid."
The most important game is yet to come. And Madrid showed today that they can beat us. Hope that these words will not get back to him
"It always ages bad. He’s young, there will inevitably be a slump."
"Def bad. 

Last season he was mad quiet after being dunked on 3 times in row. He's having his first truly successful season, but instead of staying humble like the greats before him, he's starts flapping his lips.

Shit like this NEVER end well. This video will 1000% bite him for the rest of his career. Mark my words"
The ref needs to step up and stop some of the attacks earlier
Don't think it would be that he will try 10x harder
You guys really need to let these players just be themselves and create their own names. A young core of players who have personalities and utter belief + confidence in themselves is so important and why Barca are thriving this season.
"or just let him be himself instead of personas you project onto him!

edit: xavi said in a presser that el clasico sexually arouses him"
"This is his personality tbf and we have to embrace it, not everyone is Messi with his shy and kind attitude, Lamine loves to shit talk consistently"
he can do that. He’s 17 and never before have I seen a football player this good at such young age
"Oh shut up. Lamine has won a Euro, beat Madrid 3 times this season and has won 2 trophies with Barca while being 17 years old. He absolutely deserves to be a bit cocky and trash talk them."
Jaja Madrid y nunca más
">theres something in winning with grace that Barcelona lacks.

You mean as gracious as RMTV intimidating the ref BEFORE the match, or your crazy players intimidating the ref AFTER the match.

So so lacking."
Oh the fucking irony lmao
"Like for instance, your team? winning or losing  never comes with grace for madrid"
Like how you all celebrated in front of Atletico fans? So graceful
Can’t handle a bit of shit talk huh
It’s fine. He and Barca will have a blip when he’ll get his ass whooped with a belt by Madrid so you guys can have fun too. But it’s his turn rn eh
"True, but again he is 17, so prolly should cut him some slack lol."
The atmosphere in the training sessions is one of revenge (again).
"Barca will have Balde and Lewy back by then, and it's home advantage.

I doubt"
You mean in two weeks?
congrats your billion dollar club keep losing to a teenage brokelona
"Hate to break it to you but Yamal is pretty popular and likeable around the world, he probably isn't that for you because you are a Real Madrid fan and that's fine, you don't have to like him, but acting all high and mighty about a 17 year old celebrating a trophy after the stuff your club pulled recently feels like an odd timing."
"Lamine only acts this way towards Madrid, no other club. And rightfully so with the amount of harassment he receives from Madrid fans/media and targeting of his own family, he can talk all he wants. Don’t expect a La Masia grad to be respectful towards Madrid lol."
"Lmao go cope little buddy, 🥲🤣"
"You must absolutely fucking hate Vini then, right? Right?"
"Uhmm, he has got all the rights to say it after dunking on Madrid thrice this season.

If it ages well or not that's a different story all together.

And I hope he dunks on Madrid yet again in La liga."
Mason mount  stray 😂 non comparable buddy just sleep
"Bruv what 💀

Ay yo, y'all come get this guy"
"lol you always stay humble, well you probably should. Youre not Lamine Yamal"
Actually Legendary
As an Aussie I understood this reference.
it’s weird that when all is said and done he can’t go out with the team to celebrate the trophies
They’re famous
How is Corey Worthington getting a reference here hahaha
To be cringe is to be free
"This isn’t cringe, it’s what football needs. Players saying stuff like this keeps the rivalries alive"
"This is based, not cringe."
"The guy has zero cringe, let him be"
"Hello, human resources?!"
Collecting them like infinity stones
Anuloooo mufa
[he’ll be like this](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSUDITg5LF8XTMQW0CLFcwMn_x7MUd5jFSwA1Pbt5TwHXOloIe31S3PQmTI&s=10)
I can wait actually. It doesn't even have to be this year tbh
Fucking SUBSCRIBE!!!
But before that he'll come across this video in 5 years and cringe
"yup same here, now imagine you were 17 with yamal’s money - i would’ve looked like a clown for sure"
"If I had millions of dollars at 17 I'd have been an absolute menace. 

You can only hope you have a good system and good people in place to keep the wonderkids in check."
Laugh...or curl up into a ball out of embarrassment
"I mean, who on earth would be embarrased about beating Madrid 3 times in a row, being a key player on all of them?"
how did you not even mention THE HAIR
It’s the hair and why the 2 glasses.
The shirt backwards is a common thing among  cup winners
Curious as a non Spanish or Catalan speaker can you understand any of it or are they vastly different languages?
"In case you are curious, this is what he says in Catalan:

> *Parlant amb Ronald a l'hotel li vaig dir: si ens marquen un gol, no passa res. Si ens marquen dos, no passa res. Perquè aquest any no poden amb nosaltres, ho hem demostrat. Estem molt contents. Visca el Barça!*"
I replayed it over and over again wondering if my brain was broken or if he was just speaking too fast or what
Yeah but usually they only speak Catalán to local media (which Barca One technically is) so I get the confussion
"He is, but Catalan is not his mother tongue, so it's sadly rare to see him speaking Catalan, even though he speaks it perfectly. AFAIK he speaks Arabic at home. And in public he usually speaks Spanish.

In contrast, other players have Catalan as mother tongue and it's common to see them using it always: like Pau Cubarsí or Marc Casadó. Or historic players like Puyol, Xavi, Piqué or Guardiola."
He doesn't wear a señera on his cleats.
"I'm half basque and I howl at basquecels who think ""txurroak"", ""gofreak"" and ""txokolatea"" come from some ancient language untouched by evil Spain"
"Escoció cuando su padre puso ""Arriba España"" en insta?"
"From another post he speaks Arabic at home. From his neighbourhood I suppose he mostly speaks Spanish with friends. Public schools are in Catalan though.

I cannot say anything about his Arabic as I do not speak it but his Spanish and Catalan are both flawless: this is not surprising as most Catalan people speak Spanish flawlessly."
"Spanish, his mother is from Guinea Ecuatorial and Catalan in spoken less and less among Catalan youth."
slamine shady
R9 had 44 goals and 15 assists in 47 games by age 17 in Brazil
Kounde is the king of drip. We get it bro -- you're french
Kounde’s drip is a level his own. Guy’s a fashionista.
"Seriously. He thinks a good ""aura"" is looking like a diva."
"He doesnt have Messi's ability lol. Relax bro he is still 17, but he is a fantastic player. People are blowing a lot up his ass. I thought he was just good in the game against Madrid, Pedri stole the show and so did their RB Kounde."
Appreciating the non Spanish Madrid fan telling me which players I can and can’t like
lol Saying a spanish Madrid fan can’t like a spanish player when he plays for spain is kinda nuts even for this sub
"ale moreno, no? 😂 has to be one of the worst clickbaiters in pundit history"
Pundits doing anything to get engagements that's how media works today.
"Understandable coming from wining la liga, champions league and Supercopa to this shit"
Some say they are still holding back rudiger
"Joke of a club is hilarious lol, curious who you support."
Got hooked up with the best from Tottenham
Will never stop people lol. If his career ever dips even 10% of this season they’re going to bully this kid so bad.
"I know, there are still a few times they'll meet this year, that's why i said it can age good or bad. If he didn’t say ""this year"" no way that would age good"
"I mean, Real won all of the games last year. Shit can turn. 

>Has every right to be confident

Not denying that at all, i did say it can age well"
"Only one in la liga, he means this season."
Just one more.
Only one left at 11th May
"Brother this was literally a cup final, there is no game more important than that. Real can win against Barca in league and its still up to Barca if they win or lose the league."
"wouldnt say the most important because Barcelona is going to that game with a 4 point lead (as of now), they can lose and still be on top if they dont drop more points before, and tying would be a great result already for them"
he just won a trophy at 17 let him celebrate ffs
"""He's having his first truly successful season"" What a load of nonsense, he got robbed of a goal last season and had a great campaign at the Euros at 16. 

Already bagged two goals and two assists against Madrid in his first season as a guaranteed starter. On track for a 40 G/A season and possibly a treble at 17 while being a top 5 player itw. He talks the talk but he backs it up."
"No. They’re thriving because their players are playing well and Madrid have been finally caught up with not replacing their midfielders Kroos and Modric properly and their full backs of old. Real Madrid will rebuild and come back next season and it won’t be easy. All this shit talk when you win is easy, like Michael Jordan said.

And this very sub which is praising him now will clown him and say “this shithead got humbled” when Madrid inevitably win over Barca in the near future."
He said he found el classico exciting and the press translated it to mean horny because they could
hell yeah literal woke mind virus!
"Imagine that was Vini, you would never let it go"
"Meh I wouldn't get cocky, a mid Madrid took the game to you when everyone was expecting you guys to smash them.

I'm pretty sure they'll beat you next classic especially if you play like how you did today."
"Home advantage is irrelevant for classicos.

Especially since both have tourist crowds who are more interested in taking pictures than pushing their team lol"
"Mate, I've spent 10y watching Messi and Iniesta dunk on us multiple and always had nothing but respect for them still. There's a reason why most RM fans respect these 2 and not guys like Alba, Pique or Xavi.

17y Messi scored at hatty vs us on his damn debut Clasico. Yet never talked or acted like a smug cunt. 

I can't wait for this little cunt's downfall. Fati 2.0"
"Cope about what. Win some lose some. 

This is RM, we're 1000% bouncing back and winning again. 

I'm not worried one bit"
"""Rightfully so"" .... But when Vini speaks against racism, he needs to shut up and play. 

Of course it's r/soccer, so no surprise it's full of Barca meat riders"
This was ones of the first YouTube phenoms
If you think he isn’t getting into every nightclub in Barcelona in VIP then you’re wrong
You mean he won’t be SEEN celebrating the trophy w the lads
Don't think they'll be much celebrating. They need to rest for Inter milan in 3 days
"When Foden was 17 he wasn’t allowed to join the rest of the team’s celebrations, so he went out fishing with his dad instead lol. Caught a really good one too."
Having two pairs of sunglasses and bleach blonde hair will never not be cringe
Sometimes I wonder if argentinians are the one saying this or if it really got that popular
**La mufa pateó los penales como Inglaterra en los 90s.**
"No Annulling the Mufa plz, what’s said is said, thank you very much."
**¡Y yo activo el WiFi de la buena suerte!**
Let’s hope he doesn’t have a [drunk Messi moment](https://youtu.be/QF_n6GPz8P8?si=rw1i8hmI0PBDsQHm)
doubt it. he doesnt look like a clown he looks cool af. like liam gallagher lol.
Cause he's fucking about? Lmao
"Not just money, but on international TV and in the media constantly. No idea how you grow up into any sort of normal human being with a life like that."
I would have gone for extra clown.
I’d have ODed.
"I can’t imagine the amount of professionals required to make a wonderkid turn out well adjusted. Financial Planners, Accountants, Lawyers, Media and PR trainers, Sports Psychologists, and Personal Therapists."
"At this point Im already used to it, that match felt like ages"
He kind of looks like a middle-aged lesbian with the hair-sunglasses combo
He looks like Abel Xavier
"Really trying for a nickname. You heard of 2 Jags, he's 2 pair."
Are you the ESPN commentator?  OMG did he have an issue about going before the king with two pair of sunglasses on.
Not vastly different. They’re kind of in between French and Spanish. But things don’t need to be that different to be hard to understand. I bet there’s some old timers from Scotland you couldn’t make out a word of.
You can catch some words and maybe decipher what he is saying based on that but generally you wont understand catalan if you dont know it
I speak Spanish and I can make out what they’re saying but not in full detail. Enough to know what’s going on but not enough to be 100% sure. Lots of words are similar to Spanish and some are even the same I think.
95% overlap
"That's so interesting, it's really easy to see why it's described as a mix of Spanish and French after reading that."
This is like when I took French in college thinking it would be pretty easy since I speak Spanish. Reading and writing wasn’t bad but listening to someone speak French and trying to understand was a whole different level.
Cubarsi is actually worse in Castilian than Catalan. World class footballing Catalan country boy.
My man can speak anything.
Can messi speak Catala ?
Yeah he speaks Arabic to his mother from Guinea Ecuatorial LMFAO
"> AFAIK he speaks Arabic at home.

you got microphones in his house?"
"Spanish has a lot of words of Basque origin too (aquelarre, chabola, bacalao, chistorra, izquierda, mochila, chatarra, guiri, etc). That's a normal thing that always happens with neighbouring languages.

Also, gofre comes from French ""gaufre"" and chocolate from from Nahuatl ""chocolatl""."
Has never been spotted speaking Arabic but some redditor has decided he speaks it at home so I guess we have to go along with it lol
Leminem Yamal
"In brazil being the key lmao.

Yamal has done it in la liga, ucl, and euros too. 

Ronaldo was great too tho"
After looking up some of his pictures and remembering what Flick said a few days ago… wouldn’t surprise me if Kounde likes men
"Yamal is more in the mold of Neymar than he is of Messi



>Pedri stole the show and so did their RB Kounde.

Thank Flick for these 2. He put Pedri on that Bayern training regimen which increased his stamina and general durability, cause before he was bit by the injury bug



And Koundé went from a CB playing out of position to maybe the most complete fullback in the world this season"
2 assists is a bit better than just good
"I thought pedri was actually kinda poor. He lost the ball a lot, including the build up to their goal"
"Yamal was far better than Pedri.

Pedri was relatively quiet by is standards and have a poor 2nd half."
"Pedri was poor today by his standards. Despite the goal. Lamine was easily better and got 2 assists to show for it too. 

The heroes today were in the backline however. Gerard Martin surprisingly solid, and then Iñigo, Cubarsi and Kounde all dropping incredible masterclasses. Cubarsi especially. Insane performance."
Don't most RM fans speak Hindu or Arabic?
"Yeah, ""this shit"". Runners up in the cup, 2nd in the league, made it to knockout stages of the champions league, be sure to fire Ancelotti asap.

The big club entitlement mentality is something else."
"He clearly meant this ""season"" not this ""calendar year"""
Exactly. It’s the balance of el Classico ☯️
The kid literally specified this season.  Not sure how much more aging it can do.
"If we win next Clasico, this gonna backfire pretty well and the internet won't forget."
"Even though it's cup final and we are 4 points ahead of Madrid, I would trade this victory for victory in next classico. Our schedule is rough and I very much doubt that we can go 100% of the remaining points."
Might drop points against Valladolid. People will say “its just Valladolid” but with this schedule im 100% sure that Flick is rotating ATLEAST half the team. A draw really isnt off the cards here if they just play a 5-5-0 and hope for the best
"I know other 17yo who had monster seasons too in football, never heard them be as arrogant as this prick. 

Again, his downfall will be tasty af."
"It’s a Clasico. Are you not expecting shit talking to happen? Especially in a final? Madrid players were doing it last season themselves on social media. And Lamine says “this year” which is in reference to this season, he didn’t say anything more than that. It’s not incorrect. Wouldn’t make sense to hold it against him in the future when he’s only referring to this season in the clip."
"like do they want him pr trained to bend down his head and say yeah we were lucky mbappe is the best in the world? i don’t get it, he backs up everything he says, and when he doesn’t he will still have a crazy track record."
yeah sure dude
but it’s not vini is it lol. lamine is more likable
I can't imagine that cause he is washed.
You’re comparing a scrub to a generational player who’s only 17. Obviously it isn’t the same.
"I'm not playing, so they're never going to beat me."
"If the ref was competent, we would’ve smashed them. Red for Tchouameni, and pen for Cubarsi in the first half and we are 2-0 up against 10."
"Home advantage is never irrelevant, less so when a title is on the line."
"You are clearly mad, lol, waiting for a teenagers downfall because he talked mild shit after winning a trophy, jesus christ."
Rattled by a 17 year old lmao i love it.
"So you're wishing to Yamal a near career ending injuries because you're mad. 

Good to know"
Same type of fan who will look at Rudiger shithousing and say it's the best thing ever by the way
">I can't wait for this little cunt's downfall. Fati 2.0

"Fair enough, despite the trash talk it was a good game,"
Corey walked so Lamine could run
Executive suite for Yamal only.
You are not cool enough to pull off the bleached hair and the double sunglasses. He won the cup with 2 assists and does this. He's 17 and absolutely does not give a fuck. Actual megachad.
"Kill not the part of you that is cringe, but the part that cringes"
Got that popular for sure
"Around the WC 2022 it was just the Argentenians, but it caught on on this sub from then on. I see everyone saying this in this sub these days, and there weren't even this many Argentenians around during 2022 here lol."
It’s nerds on Reddit beating a quote to death
"Bro I'm indian, my gf is Indian and she doesn't even follow football. She used Anulo Mufa today when she saw me planning for treble celebrations. She said ""Anula Mufo"" but it's the thought that counts haha."

I'm dead. Idk what I expected opening the comments but that floored me 😂"
Hahaha no way man. He looks like a clown to anyone above 25.
average age of catalonians just jumped up 5 years
"Yeah, by the end of the match, the hair was no longer noticeable."
"Actually I speak French, Spanish and Catalan and at first Catalan seemed foreign to me because the pronunciation is sooo different from the other 2.

Once your brain makes that ""accent"" shift/connection then it's ""easy"" when you know Spanish and French, indeed.

I had that issue only with spoken catalan, as written was ""easy"" from the get go (still had to learn some basics first, but I mean it was understandable rapidly)."
I’m a native Spanish speaker and I can understand maybe 30-40% of it. Enough to understand what’s being said in general.
"I’d never thought of it that way, in Ireland for example I’ve been to a lot of places where even though we all speak English the accents and colloquial phrases have you concentrating just that bit extra to make everything out.

I imagine that if a region was to develop and continually over the course of generations have its own customs and culture it would obviously be distinct."
"Italian vibes too, some words are the same."
Catalan is much closer to Spanish than French. To pretend otherwise is delusional
"Yeah he has said on interviews that it's a bit difficult for him to speak in Spanish, since he always speaks Catalan 😅"
"nah, his gallego is rubbish..."
"Lamine's father is Moroccan. His grandmother, sister and rest of the family live in Larache, Morocco, where he has travelled often through all his life.

Also, Lamine was raised in Rocafonda neighborhood of Mataró, which has a big Moroccan immigration community."
"> In brazil being the key lmao. 

The Brazilian league in the 90’s was very decent."
R9 was great. Lamine is modern day great in Europe (which roughly translates to to the great in the world)
"Koundé development has been insane for this squad, he looked so damn good this game."
"Yeah, except for the goal, this was unironically one of his poorest games of the season."
"> I thought pedri was actually kinda poor.

Me too. It felt like today he lost the ball more times than during the past month combined."
Speak Hindu? Hindu is a religion not a language
Right about the first one. They do speak Hindu. But not Arabic. They speak Muslim instead.
Hindu isn't a language bozo
"Ah yes, the non-Spanish (likely American) Barca fan with a peach of a comment. You managed to be both xenophobic and racist in a single comment, good job!


Football is a global sport. Often, BVB fans I've come across during matches come from the US and don't speak a word of German - should I now start speaking shit about them as well?


Grow up, get a brain and go educate yourself, clown."
So do most barca fans… no?
Tf that has to do with me or the comment above?
Apart from you not knowing what hindu is... Do you really think Barça's worldwide fanbase is that much different from Real Madrid's in terms of demographics? Your own club is massive in Asia
"Come on bro Xavi went trophyless and gets fired. Madrid and Barca are different levels, we need trophies every season. Getting humiliated by the other in a trophy less season is a death trap when the other team wins trophies. Name any coach who survived such a fate on either team"
"Yeah, for Madrid standards that's a failure of a season."
"Ok, but isn't there another game between them ""this season""? Idk why I'm getting nitpicked so much on this lmao"
"Yup, best game in the world for a reason. Today showed it, pure cinema if you were a neutral"
">The kid literally specified this season

Again, this wasn't in the title so i didn't know.

>Not sure how much more aging it can do.

There's one more game between them this season, so if they lose the ""they can't beat us this season"" statement would age poorly. I really don’t get how is my comment that difficult to understand."
"You do you but that's insane, giving up a trophy for better odds at winning another, which btw we still very much are favourites to win."
are you stupid
Apart from Pele who else? Hating on a 17 year old as a grown ass man is nuts. Gets abuse from Madrid fans but isn't allowed to say they haven't been able to beat us this year which is factually true hahah. Grow up mate
Lmao this is the most pathetic shit I've ever seen
Who ? You trd who is scoring or assisting in finals and qf ucl ? You btch ass ? What 17 year is doin that
A scrub? lol Just celebrate the victory my guy stop embarrassing yourself
"So ref is the reason you couldn't play out of their press and were sloppy?

Is it so hard to acknowledge you were bad today and your backline stepped up big today?"
"Yes it is lol. Not to mention barcad stadium sucksss, no atmosphere usually"
"Rattled lol.

Remind me in a few years when you'll bring back flashbacks videos of him at 17 cause he can't spend 3 months being fit at a time"
"World beaters like Riqui Puig, Cuenca, Keita Balde, Sergi Samper, Jeffren, Bojan, Ansu Fati ... right ? 

Or you want me to keep going ?"
"It would be coping if it was ManU or Arsenal who hasn't won jack in years.

Madrid literally won trophies last season, and the one before, and before. 

So yes, win some lose some."
it was a cracker of a game. A proper final.
He is not cool enough either. Nobody on this planet is
"You'd be surprised, we can appear at anywhere that mentions the country lol. Its a very proudful country after all"

"So you can read and write in English, French,  Spanish and Catalan. Bloody champion :)"
"That's because of all the languages Italian is the one that shares the highest de degree of lexical similarity with Catalan, with estimates ranging from 87% to 90%. More than with Spanish, which might be shocking."
"It's crazy that Castilian and Portuguese are more closely related than Castilian and Catalan. Because I've seen many people said that if you're speaking Castilian, 90% chances that you would understand Portuguese as well and vice versa."
Yeah and his mother is from Guinea Ecuatorial
So linguistic exchange like that is common. It's a no brainer that Basque and Spanish have influenced each other.
lol i totally forgot he scored a banger. Yeah great goal but overall not his best showing. I thought ferran was really good though
Had me in the first half.
Xavi got fired because he couldnt contain the excuses and Laporta got sick of it. Not because he didnt win last season.
you're right we play in 2 weeks
"Man, madrid fans are dense. He's saying Madrid can't beat them this season, so far, because it's been 3-0, with two batterings. It's some pretty light trash by a 17 year old, which is triggering Madrid fans. ""But Madrid could win next game!!!"""
Dude is bad at gambling
He is hella mad haha. He is now posting and complaining in the Madrid subreddit. Grown ass dude getting mad at 17 yr old who is living his life.
"Not as pathetic as your 2 trips to Europa.

Or getting dunked 8-2 while being score on by the very you loaned ... twice."
This kids 17 and dunked on Madrid 3 times this season and won a Euro. Vini has like 3 goals for Brazil in his career. No they are not the same mate😂
"Man Madrid didn’t touch the ball all first half AND had the ref blatantly in favor for them. Yes second half, for about 30 min they were the better team. All of extra time also we bossed them. With a good ref this is easily a 3-0 type of game. Our back line and subs had to step up because we were playing against Madrid + ref + var. get fucked."
Nope. Wrong
I'll make sure send to you a pic with all the trophies he is going to win in the next few years.
Mate you definitely got some mental issues going on. No way you’re this pressed about a 17 year old who dunks on your squad consistently😂
"On one hand you have Messi, Puyol, Iniesta, Xavi.. You know, WC winners.

it's not that crazy. we share a peninsula after all.
"> It's crazy that Castilian and Portuguese are more closely related than Castilian and Catalan.

PFFFFFF HAhHAHAHAHAHAH

You guys need to leave your small town at some point. There's a whole world out there to discover. 

Portuguese is in no way shape or form closer to Spanish than Spanish is to Catalan."
"Sure, but the point stands. To be honest, his first “retirement/firing/whatever you wanna call it” happened because we were on a crazy losing streak while Madrid was steamrolling their competition (started with the supercopa loss) and then culminated with the Villarreal comeback loss. Then when it became untenable and Xavi “retired” we got some calm back and started to perform again so the heat became off of Xavi and he chose to return back to the team after Laporta begged him. Then he asked for players publicly and then got reprimanded by Laporta to which he held a press conference saying we can’t compete with Madrid and then he got fired again by Laporta. The entire saga was annoying asf to follow and I hate Laporta for disrespecting our legend and wished he just let him retire in peace the first time. But it all started because of the fact we got humiliated by Madrid"
">so far

This part isn't in the title

And I'm not being triggered, just saying there is more games between them this year/season and that the statement ""they can't beat us"" has the possibility of aging badly, it ain't that deep"
No one has ever been this mad before
"Vini hás 2 goals in 2 finals of the CL, as I said just go celebrate and stop embarrassing yourself with those takes.

You think that because Yamal is better that he can just do whatever he wants lol"
"You didn't answer me. Is the ref the reason you couldn't play out of their press?

Is ref the reason raphinha kept shooting across the goal and dropped a generational stinker? Etc"
He has posted 11 comments trashing Yamal. He is def rattled hahaha

"https://youtube.com/shorts/OmgFaOpmaUs?si=defgxEJmONKrak4Y


Just needed to post this legendary clip"
I'm agreeing with you!
"No.. he was safe in his job for next season and then came out with more negativity and excuses and Laporta fired him.

Xavi never had any intention of resigning. It was all political games to save his job at time and worked."
Vini is like 25 and regressing yearly mate they are not in the same category stop comparing them😂 Is he a top 30 player in the world right now?
I did are you blind. They played better for 30 mins…
"11 ... almost the same amount of years you made it to a CL final. 

If you don't get past Inter it will def be 11. Ironic."
"I disagree on both counts 

First point: I think Xavi felt he had to resign because the conversation around him got way too out of control and he as a lifelong Barca fan was having a hard time dealing with hometown fans turning on him. So he resigned after the Villarreal game after the crazy comeback because it was just a string of many losses. After that we started doing good again and everyone felt that we had a real shot at champions league before the araujo mistake which maybe made Xavi feel like he didn’t finish the job and wanted another shot at it. 

So Xavi decided that he’d come back but he had conditions for Laporta where he didn’t want to be put in a bad situation again if the team started losing games the next season. And then him and Laporta had an argument because they wanted to bring outside help as xavis assistant coach and Xavi said what we needed instead were different players and wanted to sell Lewa raphinha and others. Then he did that the next day in public on press conference saying we’re not able to compete with Real Madrid next season because our finances are bad and we can’t buy players. And that was the last straw that made Laporta fire him because he spoke the truth. 

I’m not saying I’m not happy for flick, because I definitely am and we needed a change from Xavi - but the way he left is a bad presidential job from Laporta that it was ego from Xavi. He had his faults, namely not being able to adjust in game. But he’s Barca legend and I’d say his player recruitment in coaching is world class because every amazing player we have now was most likely recruited or elevated by Xavi"
I don’t think you understand what I’m saying so maybe go have lollipop or something lol
"He had no intention of leaving and was one of most protected Barca coaches by the media in recent memory.

Played the political game and almost got away with it then couldnt bite his tongue on negativity and excuses.

Laporta caught on and dunted him.

Best for everyone."

Honest question: what kinda role does Ancelotti play in this unhinged behavior? I always thought he was more of a gentleman coach. Is he part of the problem or has just given up?
"Looking from the outside RM have humiliated themselves over this. Their attempts to influence the refs and VAR clearly worked to an extent yet they still lost and then threw a massive on field wobbler over it. 

Can someone in Spain explain to me why the FA allow RM to run these anti ref campaigns? Not that long ago I was watching RM Tv in Spain and sat in shock as they had an hour long show on apparent bad decisions against them. 

In the PL recently Notts Forest got a 750k fine for a social media post suggesting that the VAR ref was an opposition team fan. I’m guessing it’s got to the point where RM are untouchable and can just do as they please without consequence."
I think the ref had a pretty good game given the circumstances. The VAR on the other hand? A literal nightmare. Not easy to be in that spot but it was obvious to me that the RMTV rattle job worked
"If Real didnt get a pen for the incident on Ferran there would be a six month campaign and documentaries produced.

They go ballistic when foul made by Mbappe due to hand in face to Garcia.

Do they not remember last season when Almeria goal chopped off for exact same thing?

They will be hard at work producing next video to prove this was a 'robbery'."
">I think football won today.


He said the thing! :)"
"I mean idk if he’d be saying this if we lost, because we could’ve been given two penalties regardless. But fair play"
"Yeah, well said. Respect to Inigo. Great performance last night. I didn't expect him to become undroppable for them."
"Overall, there were some pretty strange decisions both ways, but I'm surprised that Barca ended up without a single penalty."
"Damn, football won lol, he brought out the phrase"
"""I think football won today"" - as a neutral here, it's hard not to agree with this."
"He was clearly rattled by the premeditated smear campaign by RM, refused to give any yellows for the horrific tackles but the VAR guys were even worse, didn't even acknowledge the penalty on Ferran and the Cubarsi shirt pull. RMTV needs to be shut down for the betterment of the league."
"

The ref had a very good match, but the pressure did get to him. The LEAST was the 94th min penalty check on Ferran, CHECK IT."
"I don't know Inigo Martinez well enough to know whether he holds true to this kind of comments on referees whether he wins or loses, but even though I tend to agree with him here, I can't shake the feeling that he's mostly able to say that in this case because this time around, he won.  
Let's just say I hope I'm proven wrong but I'm not highly optimistic."
He is very much right. Football did win last night.
"As a Madrid fan, I'm ashamed how shitshow of an end this season has became both on & off the field. I agree with the shitshow of pressuring refs from Madrid isn't worthy of a club like Real Madrid.

That said, I've gotten used to every scrutiny we face (this is deserved and should be scrutinised & many undeserved.) That said, Barcelona also have history of criticising refs. Literally last season ironically Carlo was defending refs and was criticising Xavi (?) For his ref rant. Saying ""I think football won today"" is hilariously overlooking own stance a season prior & aacting all high and mighty.

And also how are people not seeing how Influence does ""Papa Perez"" have on RFEF? He's got everyone by the balls. Even as Madrid fan, I believe its time LaLiga gets a competent president and sets firm rules and prospers to new heights rather than just be ruled by duopoly of Real & Barca. Otherwise LaLiga's allure is diminishing day by day."
"Yes, well worth the money spent on negreira than paying the players their complete salaries.  Thats a good loophole to make football win."
"If Madrid won, Barca fans would be calling the ref corrupt but sure



(They were doing that during the game too)"
Tap in merchant
"He's extremely lax on the players, unable to really berate them. That's why everyone was so enamored with him during his 2013-15 tenure."
"He's been enabling this behaviour for years. He's had plenty of chances to throw down some markers, but he's so intent on being non-invasive that it's very clearly detrimental to the culture in the dressing room. It's a toxic, entitled, and spoiled team and Carlo is very much a part of those issues, not always just as an idle bystander but sometimes also as an active participant such as when he's made either direct or thinly veiled criticisms of the referee."
He got a early yellow for bad mouthing 4th official so he's probably not better himself
Real Madrid needs Felix Magath
"I think he gets out of the way. But the president, who is more influential, heavily encourages it"
Perez has people by the balls. Everyone REALLY underestimate how influential he is.
Florentino Perez is the biggest construction guy in Spain. Construction in western Europe is traditionally held by the mafia. Connect the dots.
"It's not like in Britain. 80% of the media is unapologetically Madrid fanzine, 10% pretends to be unbiased with varying degrees of success and the remaining 10% is pro-Barcelona.


Now imagine being a fan of a different club. You have your local newspaper/radio/TV at best.


Essentially the public perception outside of Catalonia is not favoring Madrid is a crime against the laws of the universe."
"I'm surprised people watch RMtv at all. Isn't like most club channels where you see replays of old matches, highlights and random interviews. Most people are disconnected from footballa after the 90 minutes and hearing or reading some news here and there."
Perez is one of the most powerful person in Spain and real Madrid is a state supported club so no one will take actions against them . Maybe if Perez is removed and new president comes then the powers might decrease but for now real Madrid is the boss of Spainish football
"Dude Tebas literally shouts he is a Madrid fan in each and every interview.   
  
He is literally President of LaLiga and that's how he behaves in media 🤡"
">Can someone in Spain explain to me why the FA allow RM to run these anti ref campaigns?

Florentino Perez is one of the (or the) most powerful business people in Spain."
I would say a good chunk of the RFEF support Madrid. Perez also has everybody by the balls. It’s the same way they try to influence players to become free agents and run down their contracts to join Madrid for free.
"Agreed. They could have approached the game and lost like men. Instead they approached the game and lost like bitches.


Same as when Rodri won the Balon d'Or."
"This ""Real Madrid TV"" bullshit is being so overblown by both referees and this sub is insane. Absolutely nobody watches that channel, completely irrelevant for 99.9% of the population (I mean not many people watch TV as a whole), but some of you guys act as if every Spaniard during lunch put that channel to discuss the programs in family lol."
"I’d say if he had a bad game, it would be one that Barca could complain about. Madrid absolutely benefitted from some poor decisions, but at least you got the win thank god."
">pretty good game

Hard disagree, he was absolutely rattled by the threats before the game. In addition to the penalties, he wasn't willing to give out yellow card on many tackles by the Madrid players."
"A-fucking-men. 






(Don't fuck men)"
"He's been a rock, one of our best signings"
There were 3 pen shouts and the only one they check the var for was a dive
"i haven't seen the handball but none of the other three are bad decisions, fernan there is some argument, raphinha is as clear a dive as it gets, cubarsi they are both holding each other, if cubarsi had scored a goal ppl would be mad it didn't get ruled out. 

the fernan one is hard to say, didn't seem like much contact, but seen others mention there's another angle."
"Not really, can't exactly blame the ref after the shitshow your club had him face"
"The worst decision was the pen not given on Ferran.

Real have little to moan about.. but they will and claim corruption."
"Oh yeah he was shit, he didn't give 2 pens that should have been given. I hate him alright."
"It’s so natural when you just won a game, that too in extra time."
"They would call the referee influenced by the RMTV hit piece, which was true."
"Your players were doing that?

On which call did your guys got wrongfully denied. Please I will wait."
"It works because he is fucking Don Carlo

With others it would hardly work"
"I mean realistically speaking, what is he supposed to do other than leave? 

It’s a different situation considering it’s very obviously coming from Perez at the top. If it were a purely player issue I would get it, but it’s the club culture instilled by Perez. You can only put up with it or just leave"
That could be really bad for the culture of the squad going forward. With Don they have respect. He is an OG of the game. I don't Xabi Alonso would have that pull in all honesty. Zidane is the only one that could reign in these divas.
"It is not just Perez influence, there are many in the league and RFEF who softly support Madrid. Some of them like Tebas may even have ambition to be part of the club administration in the future. 

I don't know if Xabi can steer them, Zidane has that aura though.

Honestly, it sucks to have such a good squad and behave/play like this."
Perez reads like a mafia boss like president from what you read about him.
Influential how? He's only the President of one club; where does he exert his influence that causes people to fall in line so diligently?
I think construction anywhere is held by people who are strong like mafia.
he's just *very* good at business
"This is wildly inaccurate, I live in Galicia and people are just as anti-Madrid as anti-Barcelona, if not more so."
"That's really way way off, you probably are from Catalonia otherwise you'd have to be really blind to believe that."
"Why was a referee's father accosted outside of church, to talk about his son's bias against Madrid?

Why are kids getting bullied at school because their father is a ref?"
I think you're missing the point. It doesn't matter how many watches it - it's the club's TV channel. 
"It doesn't matter if many people watch it or not. But it's clear that it has a very high influence. Otherwise, we wouldn't have seen so much drama over it."
Real should have gotten a few more yellows and at least 2 penalties against them.
Barcelona should have been 2-0 up with a possible red card for Real. They could have easily lost this match and RM tv would have been the reason
Don’t tell me what to do
"I'm talking about the Cubarsi shirt pull , that dirty cunt catching Ferrans leg from behind which was imo a clear pen as clear as they come and then the Raphinha dive"
"They didn't need to check the handball, since it's clear in the rules that isn't a pen.

VAR checks everything, not only when the VAR graphics shows on screens."
"Asencios right knee hits Raphinas left ankle, how is that a dive and not a pen ?"
"I actually think the last two situations (Ferran and Raphinha) were both dives, but actual god tier dives.  
                
In Rüdiger vs Ferran we see one perspective that shows that he doesnt touch him with his shin, and then another that proofs that he doesnt touch him with his foot either. I dont think theres another way Rüdiger can even touch him there, so imo theres no touch even tho it 100% looks like it if youre looking at Ferran.        
            
The Raphinha situation is clearer, the last perspective they showed made it obvious that there was no touch on the legs, maybe there was a slight touch with his hand but honestly thats not enough for a pen.        
            
The Cubarsi one is really tricky imo, because both use their arms a lot in that duel. I think its one of those situations that both can be awarded a pen or be played on depending on the ref. But I can definitely understand Barca fans here, if this pen wasnt given against my team (especially in a cup finale) I'd be furious too."
"There's one guy under this comment doing just that even though you won, so idk go argue with him coz I know what I've seen"
I'm yet to see this
"Lol, under this post too

Just amazing"
"Nah, corrupt


That's what they were saying in the Barca match thread"
"That, and a solid pushback was needed after the toxic Mou era."
Exactly. It's Perez who is enabling this kinda attitude from the very top. Doubt Carlo is enabling this kinda behaviour.
"xabi definitely would have pull in RM. He's not Carlo or Zidane obviously, but he has won every trophy as a player and he's well-respected for his time in Madrid

and as a manager, what he did at Leverkusen is historic"
"The ""friendship"" memes is how they operate as a unit. That's still not in question the problem is it's all one toxic friend group feeding off of the negativity of each other. The Balon d'Or snub was a prime example of this, the whole club throwing a fit because of Vini. Their camaraderie is not in doubt, it's how the deal with everyone outside of themselves."
"Half the season they have been whiny bitches. 

It started all the way from Balon'dor saga."
did you just come out of an eight month long coma?
"He’s not just the president of a club (the big one, mind you), he’s also a construction billionaire with multinational contracts."
He's in charge of one of the biggest construction companies in the world. He also has a hand in a large part of the energy services in Spain and Europe. He also is close with many Politicians on both sides and not just in Spain. He's also a billionaire and has complete control of probably the biggest club in the World
He's probably top5 in people with the most power in Spain.
Being a billionnaire helps
He's a billionaire with untold connections he's made in in Spain and across Europe. Can't be so naive 
Listen to the Villarejo leaks.
"Is it something of a legacy after Franco or have my history wires been fucked with? Most people in the communities, islands support their own but a good portion go for Real because of it's stature , history and they don't really care about football that much. There just band wagoning."
"So what? It's a private channel, they can say whatever they want. If journalism in this country wasn't a fucking cancer they would just dismiss this channel as dumb Real Madrid fanatics and would instead focus on talking about relevant things."
"We've seen so much of it because the cancer of journalism we have in this country has to focus on polemic things as they know they will sell, if they had just a tiny bit of respect for their profession they'd focus on being good journalists instead of making ragebait/clickbait articles regarding this stupid channel."
Tchouameni’s tackle on Olmo should have been a red.
"When someone mentions Red and penalties, I would put VAR more at fault than the ref.

VAR has more reaction time and they can call the ref to the monitor any time.

I thought the ref was consistent until he gave the yellow to Gerald. If that was a yellow, so many of previous fouls should have been carded."
Think its more about fouls on Cubarsi and the shark not being checked not the handball. (Or atleast they were checked and the wrong decision was made)
RMTV had a video claiming a penalty for Real Madrid recently for same thing.
"-Cubarsi shirt pull 
-Foul on ferran in the box 
-Raphinha dive"
">They didn't need to check the handball, since it's clear in the rules that isn't a pen.

Is it because the hand was positioned naturally to fall on it? Because that didn't happen after the ball hit the hand, he raised it again"
"It's actually the opposite in the rules. Most people don't seem to know this but the rule clearly states that if you support yourself while sliding, it's not a handball. Valverdes arm is not on the ground and he's risking a handball while sliding like that. It should be a pen according to the rules."
">(Ferran and Raphinha) were both dives, but actual god tier dives.

Is this god tier bait?"
"What were you actually watching if you didn't see rudigers foot touch ferran? from the back it didn't look like a foul but it was clear he touched him but when they showed the other angle from the front it's clear as day that he puts his foot underneath ferrans shin and moves it to the side, making it impossible for ferran to retain his balance.
And the foul on cubarsi they're not both grabbing each other, cubarsi is trying to push away from ceballos which is why he ends up horizontal on the air with his shirt halfway pulled up.
He's clearly obstructing him from reaching the ball."
"1. Ferran got his foot lifted, pretty clearly?

2. While Raphinha did get a hand in the back (there wasn’t a touch by the feet), he did dive.

3. Even if there was pulling on both sides, you can clearly see Cubarsis shirt almost off. He clearly can’t reach the ball because of it."
"Nah no one is doing that as nothing to 'blame' him for..

Can point out the hypocrisy of Real and the worst decisions going in their favour without seeking to 'blame' ref for anything.

The Real Madrid mindset."
Ah so its only Barca fans that accuse referees...
I'm sure rmtv will have another hitpiece on the chosen referee the next time we face since it worked so well this time and they didn't face any punishment. disgusting
Thanks! That broader context is actually what I was asking about.
Makes sense.
Lots of owners are billionaires. I don't deny that he's influential - it's very evident! I was more wondering how is this guy connected in ways that enable that compared to other owners.
"And the Spanish FA, in theory has no reason to listen to him. FAs have godlike powers over football. Entirely legally they could, and imo should, maul madrid over these antics. Perez cannot do the same back in the same way.

So why do they kowtow?"
Can you link it?
"There is a political component in older supporters for sure, and those ""indoctrinate"" their youngest. But it dilutes with time and depends what team is the most successful. In the balearics I've seen changes of what club is ""visibly supported"", with Real Madrid being the most supported by a mile until FCB started winning international trophies and being dominant. Nowadays there is a lot of Barça support due to younger people being marked by the advent of Messi. I guess this is partly a byproduct of a ""two team"" league (polarization), and way harder to understand for a Premier League supporter. As a Betis and Spurs fan I don't get the Madrid/Barça bandwagoning but I'll say my sympathy moves towards the team that plays more entertaining football at that point in time."
"I've lived in Spain all my life and that was never my impression, and I'm a Barça fan, outside of Catalonia. And the split is closer to 50/50 than 80/20"
">they can say whatever they want

Similarly, they can be criticised and bashed for saying whatever they want."
He should’ve been sent off in the first half lol
"That's my point. VAR checks everything, so the narrative that only one of the incidents reached VAR is wrong.

You may not like the decision, but if VAR chooses not to intervene that's because they decided to not intervene, not that they haven't checked."
"Yes, natural position. Not trying make himself bigger."
"Come on, that's not a reasonable take. He is sliding in, and the arm is In neutral position embracing the contact with the ground to support his body.

I don't understand how the rule would be written to support what you are claiming. Then they would have to slide on with their arms behind their backs until they are sure the would reach the ground and then, just then, from one frame to another in the video reach out and touch the grass with their hand. They are professional athletes but I think is asking a bit much of them.."
raphinha was as clear a dive as it gets
Well at least the Raphinha one was a dive. In the Ferran situation I was a little blind but I see the touch now  😶‍🌫️
"Actually youre right, looking at it again he does touch Ferran slightly with the tip of his foot. Mightve been a little sleepy yesterday, I thought the first perspective made it clear that the foot doesnt touch.         
Still not sure about he Cubarsi situation tho, we just have one perspective and it genuinely looks like they both cling onto each other, from the beginning till the end of the duel. But as I said, you can probably give this penalty. I'd be mad if it wasnt given against my team. Just dont think its a clear situation so I dont think VAR can do anything."
"> Nah no one is doing that


This is completly false man, use your eyes idk what to tell you"
Have a look into it its very interesting. In the early 2000s Madrid were in debt and sold they're old training ground to the Spanish Government for then around half a billion. This coincidences nicely with Perez taking control and the Galactico Era starting. This man has been hugely influential for decades and is (unfortunately) one of the best at what he does.
He doesn't own the club.
"Nah I think is pretty accurate, I live in Málaga and people go hard for Madrid and not so much for Barcelona, I would have had my family woken up if Madrid had won yesterday just because they often do fireworks whenever Real gets a title."
"The shirt pull I still can see that, even though it's a pen according to the rules, you can say both were pulling each other etc, ok. But the pen on Ferran, there is no explanation for it to not be a pen. If the VAR reviewed it, and didn't intervened that's even worse"
"People expect VAR not just to check themselves, but to also call the ref to the screen for controversial situations so when its said that ""VAR didn't check something"" what I think people mean is that they didn't call the ref to the screen to double check, instead they just checked and determined that they have no basis to call the main ref to the screen. 

Its just a flawed system in my opinion, from a spectator POV you see the on field referee not making some calls (fair enough, he might've missed them, that's what VAR is for, right?) and VAR not calling him to the screen to double check because the ""error"" isn't clear enough to do that."
"It blows my mind that people *still* think VAR are just playing Clash of Clans on their phones until the referee phones them in like it's a lifeline in Who Wants to be a Millionaire. I think they were categorically wrong in the instance with Ferran, but it'd be bizarre to have a system where the referee only calls the VAR when he thinks he's made a mistake."
No it isnt.
"People can’t make up their minds what they want VAR for. “Clear and obvious” is the worst possible definition they could’ve come with because football is really nuanced in that aspect. 

When VAR doesn’t intervene we get a ton of people saying it should have, when it does then people argue it shouldn’t. Refs really can’t win in a game where 80% of the calls are subjective."
"I agree, people do change their minds about what they want, but I do believe that in general main refs should be called to do the video review more often, not just when ref makes a clear and obvious error. 

Main referee double checking controversial calls himself should be the norm IMO, it makes everyone watching feel like there is a transparent process behind important calls and not just some communication nobody can hear. Its not like the refs have to change their decision when going up to the screen, its still their call, but nowadays I'd say they do change it in overwhelming majority of the cases, just because of the nature of the system. 

I think more of a NBA style challenge system (without challenges, just VAR refs ""challenging"" the main ref) would make for a better experience."
"It’s difficult to implement something that would satisfy everyone because footballing culture will always be against changes, but I think something along the lines of NFL refereeing would be a lot better than what we currently have: VAR intervenes under demand from the coaches, each coach has 1-3 demands per game. It is already becoming a pain to watch football when no call is definitive anymore.

What I think should’ve been mandatory years ago is having the ref comms line hooked to the stadium audio, FIFA doesn’t like the idea but I genuinely think people would be less mad at the refs if they understood their PoV on the 50/50 calls"
What a crazy game of football.
Insane game but fuck ESPN for their feed cutting out TWICE in the game during crucial moments
Absolute box office stuff
Madrid about to enter the nuclear codes
Madrid PR intern cooking up the victim complex statement of a lifetime
"If Spanish league is fair, Rudiger would get suspended for the rest of the season"
Rudiger so fucking headless. Serves him right.
Seeing the manchildren Rudiger and Vinicius lose their crap was the highlight
Generational hatewatch. We love to see it
Disgusting behaviour from Rudiger
You will be hearing from RMTV
Generational crash out from Madrid this week. An institution of entitled crying brats and primadonnas.
"The audacity to put out referee content on the TV channel and again to throw objects at the Ref? Haha Madrid, entitled clowns"
Shameful from Rüdiger at the end. Stupid thing to do.
"There is no team in all of sport that I like seeing lose more than Real Madrid. I’m no Barca fan, but congrats on beating them after this shitshow of a week"
That was the most sunday league shit I've ever seen in my life in extra time. What a fucking embarrassing display from madrid this week.
Seems like Barcelona has Real Madrid’s number.
All that crying and bitching about refs and here we are even with refs clearly being on RM side you still f***ing lose.
It feels so nice to see Madrid lose after all the shit they pulled
beating madrid+refs makes this extra special. they ulted and still lost
Rudiger assaulting the ref - peak Spanish football
Didn't like having to play extra time but 2 trophies on our biggest rival's head and maybe a 3rd in 2 weeks. Proud of this team.
"Madrid absolutely lost the plot, the most hated club in the world, love to see it"
Pray to god i never want to hear RMTV complain about refs ever again
"for all the chaos, hype and background going into this match this game delivered 110%. Best clasico I've seen in a loooooong time"
Hate saying the word but it kinda feels like justice after what happened in the first 90 minutes. Barca should be pissed they had to play 30 minutes more before the CL semis when VAR exists
Football won today.
Lmao literally every neutral fan today is happy to watch Real Madrid lose. That’s how unlikable this specific bunch have become lately
Refree really tried hard to give real a winner.
"New fan here, when do they get to play the Remontada at the Bernabeu?"
Rudiger needs to go to an asylum as soon as possible what is this weirdo doing
"Don't let this win distract and make us forget how corrupt Madrid is in trying to influence the game and how the ref, not accusing him as he was under pressure from the media and from Madrid, allowed 4 obvious uncalled fouls which should have led to yellow cards and penalties.

If Madrid had won this, then the very fabric of integrity in football would have been one step closer to being unwoven."
Football won.
Pathetic losers. Get fucked
Hope the ref has a safe way home
Vini ans Rudiger should be banned for the behavior
Trent you're a key part of a title winning team and you want to throw all of that away for a Real Madrid team that is in a period of transition at best or is outright chaotic at worst
"How did Barca turn it around so fast?? 2 years ago they were bit of a meme, in deep financial trouble, lost to United in Europa. Now they are close to getting a treble while playing attractive football"
Congrats Barca. The Spanish league has allowed Real Madrid disgraceful behavior for too long. They need to bring the hammer down on these guys. They’re bad for football.
Real Madrid should've just forefeited but seeing them lose their shit was entertaining.
I never want to hear Bellingham being better than Pedri again.
Rudiger should be temporarily detained under the mental health act. He is genuinely not right in the head.
"I feel sorry for Mbappe, easily one of the most likeable players for madrid and deserves more from this season"
Fun game that showed that De Burgos is actually shit.
Everybody liked that. Madrid are embarrassing from top to bottom
"Gratz mates, very happy for you"
Fuckoff cheating Vardrid
Madrid are so unlikable holy shit what a bunch of crying cunts.
Endrick needs to move smarter.
DEATH THREATDRID LOSE AGAIN
Real Madrid are a disgrace lmao. Pray for this ref.
"What an embarrasing team Real are... So many unlikeable players, happy Barcelona won it."
Good. Real Madrid deserve nothing but losses until they can behave properly as a club.
"Rudiger scares me, I'd rather not meet him in a dark alley"
Vini definitely didnt deserve ballon d'or
What are the chances that Madrid wont complain after the game.
I’m just happy Rudiger is good enough to be a soccer player otherwise I fear he would be a better serial killer
"After today and yesterday, “real Madrid” and “classy” should never be used in the same sentence. Thugs club, but justice served."
"Fuck Rudiger, Fuck Madrid!"
All that pre match pressure on the refs to get away with murder and still lose. You love to see it.
"Guys I just woke up from a 2 hour coma, did I miss anything eventful in the game?"
Referee tried his true best for Real Madrid to win. This victory tastes so much better after all that happened off the field
"Ball doesn’t lie, Barca were by far the better team save that 20 minute period where Madrid turned the jets on."
"So, so happy these entitled pieces of shit lost. Enjoy your misery cunts ❤️"
Rudiger should be attending therapy like for real
"Absolutely disgusting game, RMTV threats worked and you could tell. Referees were one sided and, if you watched the game on the spanish public broadcast, terribly madridista too. It was a shameful game."
Real not winning any titles this season. The World is healing
Football won today.
What a chaotic game but Barcelona has had Madrids number for a minute now
"Madrid are such a disgrace. From their unsportsmanlike behaviour to being assisted by the referee...

Words are not enough to describe what these people deserve. Freaking arrogant."
You absolutely unequivocally love to see it
"I have no interest in Spanish football, but I’m glad Madrid lost"
"I am not gonna lie being a manchester united fan I have always had a soft spot for madrid and even cheered their goals but this has been utter childish from them  
they played well in the 2nd half of normal time though"
I cant believe Pau Cubarsi is 18. He plays like veteran player aleady.
Macca is doing some major pearl clutching about Yamal wearing sunglasses when meeting the king lol
"This season for now:

 - retired guy - 2 trophies;

 - Real Madrid - 0 trophies."
How do Barca have so many staff members  and reserve members crash the field on the final whistle. That was a generational hate-win. They certainly enjoyed that.
"Rudiger audibly calling the ref a whore son in German, cinema"
Seeing Rudiger and Vinicius crash out was absolute cinema and Lamine Yamal’s comments was the icing on the cake.
You love to see it. Disgraceful behaviour from Madrid.
"Absolutely insufferable team Madrid are. Bunch of absolute primadonnas. Except my boy Bellingham who is a good lad of course. But all the rest, fuck me."
First team in the history of the competition to win 11v12
**JOULES KOUNDE QUE JUGADOR**
"Fucking Endrick, did jack shit"
ASI ASI PIERDE EL MADRID
Fuck you Florentino!
A new rmtv video after this game is gonna hit like crack
MADRID CABRON SALUDA EL CAMPEON!!
Deserved. Brilliant team!
So much better for them to lose that way haha. Give them hope then snatch it away
It's time to accept they're winning the treble.
I can't believe Trent wants to join that Madrid team.
A referee performance to be ashamed of
"And they're still asking ""Why does everyone hate us""?"
Madrid are such a bunch of losers LMAO
Eat shit you entitled cunts
Real deserved it for all the shit they pulled. So glad Barca won.
In comming days real Madrid will cry and saying they are the victims
Take that shitter
How are they going to penalize Rudiger? Throwing ice to the referee is crazy
"Third treble om the cards, they deserve it"
Madrid in shambles. Total collapse.
Monday will be interesting
Proud of this team!!!!
FUCK YOU PEREZ
Dayuuuummmmmmm 🔴🔵
Why was rudiger mad at the end? I missed it
inter milan wins today
treble incoming ;)
How much money does this bring? Asking for a friend named 'Lever'
Congrats Barcelona 👍🏼
"Real Madrid are the biggest bunch of wet losers. What a fucking disgrace from the so-called biggest club in football. Bunch of babies, losers and entitled cheats. Such small club mentality when things don’t go their way."
"Crazy game but i believe Barca deserved it more. Rudiger, you clown, you make people wish you a torn acl with that behaviour. Fuck off you little piece of decomposed shit!!! 🖕"
"Twice the pride, double the fall"
https://i.imgur.com/EvTHdsS.png
"Rudiger is a clown, Madrid has no class"
4 months into 2025 and barca already have 2 trophies
How to remontada?
"As a neutral, this is one of the best games I've seen this season! Absolute cinema"
"We are fucking for everyone 

Better be ready"
Absolute cinema
"Ah man, not for the weak one. At this rate I’m not gonna survive this season.
Thank you FC Barcelona"
It genuinely confuses me how a player like Endrick ended up on Real Madrid.
"winning CdR is this high. 

beating madrid to win CdR is thisssssss high"
Thats what Saturdays are made for
"Had to watch both the Barcelona, and Madrid versions of the “highlights”. Barcelona would have you believe that Madrid didn’t touch the ball until 48 minutes (perhaps true, didn’t watch the game).

And most of the Madrid highlights were quiet suggestions that would have you believe Madrid deserved about 5 penalty shots today."
Congrats Barca 🙌🏼
"Interesting game. BTW, I don't like how Ream Madrid treated the referees."
We’ll just save those two pens for the next Classico in a couple weeks I guess
Let’s fucking go
"this was genuine perez masterclass of dirty arts

Madrid knew they cant beat barca pound to pound, so what they did? put ultimate pressure on refree like at every damn moment possible and get aways with cheeky falls all the time.

The amount of fouls olmo conceded was mad without getting a single card 

cuz barca midfielders arent as physical as madrid, thats the only way they can beat them."
holy shit man what a game was this one
"As much as I hate Barca, they at least tried to play football, when Real played with the ref all week and all game long."
"Madrid couldn't win with all the help the refs gave them, no penatly given to Barca out of 3 clear ones, no yellows and no reds for Madrid players... 

Just another classical Madrid refereeing...."
Hansi Flick created transformers
Let's forking go!!!!!
So happy that Madrid lost. Maybe next time they should cry harder. Bunch of impolite spoiled kids.
This Madrid squad are absolutely pathetic
Fuccccccccck Yeeeeeeeeeah
Football won today
Let’s fucking goooo absolutely deserved
Madrid and Villa in a biggest crashout of 2025 battle
"I couldn't care less for Barcelona, but I'm glad they won. Real Madrid are really a classless, entitled bunch of players. Cannot imagine Galácticos behaving like this"
"Can't wait for the inevitable RMTV complaints tomorrow 

Refs tried everything but yet it wasn't enough haha"
"The league tried their hardest to give Madrid a chance with two stonewall pens not even going to VAR… What did go to VAR? Barca’s on field pen of course lol (which was rightfully called back, that was a dive by raphiña)"
VARdrid stole 3 penalty calls from Barcelona and still lost
"12 goals past us in 3 games. Congratulations Barcelona, but Carlo Ancelotti out!!!!!!"
The football karma gods have spoken
"Some madrid fans will now say after seeing todays performance they don't mind loosing. obviously they didn't mind loosing because after those blatant referee calls on those penalties they are clearly satisfied that they are able to turn the narrative in their favour.  
 PUTA MADRID."
"deserved the win, And Real deserved the loss after all those whining and moaning all the week"
THE BALL NEVER FUCKING LIES!
"So happy barca won, madrid can continue whining 😂"
Real madrid are always such sore losers.
VARdrid is finished
Lmao. What a shitshow
Absolute cinema
TAKE THAT YOU FUCKING CHEATS!!! COUNTER TERRORISTS WIN!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAH
TRIED TO ROB US. TREBLE TREBLE
fucking brahim diaz man
Was an entertaining match to say the least
My plan worked. I commented that Madrid would win to jinx them. Never have and never will support that team.
And hansi on its usual way to stack the trophies
Kounde the Robot coming in clutch.
the Shedeur Sanders hate watch and now this. all timer weekend for hate watches
"This sport isn't good for my health, man"
That was a proper fucking El Clasico
Heart was ready to burst during extra time. First of 3 I hope.
holy shit my heart on a random saturday
Congratulations Inter Milan
Congratulations now have an off day against us please
"Moral of the story:  DO NOT BULLY THE REF IN A VIDEO.

In fact there are thousands of them"
"Easy money, never doubted for a second!"
Reminded me of Pep-Mourinho era Clasicos.. An absolute delight
El Classico rarely disappoints in both style and spectacle. There's a reason why it's the most entertaining rivalry in the sport
I am happy that Olmo didn't break his leg.
"And in the end everyone is happy

Except Florentino"
"Absolute game of tactic and attrition, Barca fell apart in the 2nd half bit that Ferran goal gave us LIFE"
May have been the best game I have seen in the past few years. Even my fiancee watched it all mesmerized and she usually does not care!
And deserved too
"Yep, lots of fun with some nice goals,"
It's not football it's la liga
"Yeah, even with the loss I'm relatively happy, all the crying aside, finally we had a good classico. I expected to get 3-0ed again.  

Now only if these idiots can stop losing their mind over football I could enjoy these again"
 probably because of internet traffic
Yeah I had to reset my illegal stream several times can't believe those guys
"And awful audio the whole game, was so bad I switched to the Spanish language feed, but that also got cut off."
Fuck this. Last 10 minutes and they give us fucking ads!?!? Wtf!?
And they cut to analysts talking about their opinion of the game so far like we give a shit. Give me an update on what’s going wrong with the fucking feed!
Football won today
Would've watched 3 days non-stop of this kind of performance.

"bully da refs, post da video"
RM TV is bout to be better than Breaking Bad
Perez fuming in the control room
for what though?
RIP ref's family they are already ogne
I knew it was a bad sign when they made that trade deal with Gandhi.
Sure they will take it like men /s
The whole ref fiasco worked but still wasn't enough
He’ll play against Barça in 2 weeks knowing La Liga
"And a lengthy ban into the next. 

Seriously, throwing stuff at the ref AND having to be restrained? How the fuck do you not immediately realize you fucked up there.  This has gone way to fucking far now."
"If the Spanish league was fair, Mbappe would have received a much, MUCH longer ban than one match for his career ender of a tackle against Alaves."
I'd be surprised to see him before October. That's a multi month ban
He's just a chill guy. /s
"We will play again in 2 weeks 

From my experience,he will ho away with it"
He should be suspended for 4 months at least.
"Tuchel deserves a lot of credit for coaching Rüdiger to play clean at Chelsea. 

He had one collision with KdB and (i think?) a biting incident if I'm remembering correctly.  But that was pretty much it. 

Ever since he's moved to Madrid idk what it is but clearly he's been given free reign to be as dirty as possible."
Why was he allowed to get his medal? I thought red carded players weren't allowed?
honestly should have given barca a penalty as well. malding at ref still
Should be a long ban for throwing a bottle at a ref. Right? Right...?
Why did you leave out Jude?
"Almost perfect, the only thing which ruined it that Mbappe's ""no free kick streak"" is over."
"Never in my life have I cheered against a foreign club this much. I screamed a goal from barca that wasnt from Messi! Unbelievable levels of hatewatching, enjoyed every second"
As a Barca fan - thank you for your hatewatch solidarity. 
From RM as a whole
Overnight shift for RMTV employees.
"Most embarassing fans in football, and 90% of them are glory hunters"
"Most embarassing fans in football, and 90% of them are glory hunters"
"I usually quite like watching Madrid for the CL magic, but this week soured me on them massively. Bullying refs is beyond the pale. That + the behaviour in extra time + the Ballon d'Or fiasco... entitled unsportsmanlike fucks. Good riddance."
It really is utterly pathetic. It must be so embarrassing to be a normal Madrid fan and seeing your club and players act this way.
Does anyone know what exactly happened at the end that caused Rüdiger to lose his mental sanity?
"Barca has a phone book of numbers this year I‘d like to add. 

Only Dortmund answered once but Barca already ended this relationship and didn‘t care any more 😀"
"this and the arsenal vs man u game in the fa cup


football is truly back "
"there is genuinely something wrong with these players, they all absolutely lost their minds at the final whistle."
"Should have been kissing his feet for literally ignoring 3 clear penalties and keeping the yellow in his pocket 10-15 straight leg tackles, most from behind, instead of booking a Real player. Just imagine the scoreline if it was a fair one."
And we wouldn't have had to if this was a fair game. But fuck this entitled manchild of a team. All their pathetic antics and still getting embarrassed every single time. Smallest club mentality 
Yeah you won but so did Inter.
"I mean, justice would be some of those Madrid players actually getting punished for their antics"
"Those 30minutes can cost a lot for the remaining of the  season. Some people will be mad and blame the ref if barcelona lose next games, mbappe should have been suspended and Tchouameni excluded. 

That’s a lot of IFs and Barcelona should have killed the game in the first half and can only blame itself for going in the OT imo"
"At least none of our players got injured it seems ,Lewy and Balde coming back will be very crucial"
Inter Milan won today
Chelsea fans rooting for Barça?  Yeah. That's crazy
90 minutes at the Bernabeu is an hour and a half
"In the third leg, a month from today. Lemontada on 🫡🫡✊🏿‼️‼️🗣️"
Next season
"It has been unwoven. That's what drives me mad.


It doesn't matter who won this game. What they did yesterday should never be silenced. 


Honestly at this point a massive investigation needs to be launched.


The ref who had the parrot sing real's anthem, Mbappes murderous foul with only 1 game suspension, RMRV constantly bullying refs before games. This team acts like a mafia."
"More importantly, Madrid lost."
I can't fathom trent. He thinks people will rate him higher or respect him more after he goes and plays for Madrid? Leave the club he won it all with so desperately that he's ready to leave on madrids terms? To be a certified legend at a club as big liverpool and to simp for more succes by going to a club that wins more often?
La Masia and a great manager is how they've turned it around!
"We will always turn it around. A core footballing and wholistic education philosophy instilled in La Masia will always ensure we have decent teams at worst. Other clubs buy good teams and play good for a stretch, but the players eventually get old and then it's not easy to just buy a good team on the market. But you can forge one in a youth academy. Years and years of playing the same way in the youth systyem will result in this. Then all you need is a good manager (Flick) and 2-3 good signings to suddenly compete for everything. Laporta did good with levers and using them to buy Lewy, Kounde, and Rapha who are all balling for us."
"La masia

edit: and flick!"
"They have one of the best managers who likes to play attacking, high line, direct football. On top of it, they somehow assembled one of the youngest players who can play like seasoned veterans, have good mentality, and work hard. Within them, there's a 35+ yo who's one of the best 9s and a 17yo that may or may not be the next Messi (not in style of play or specific stats, but in how crucial he is for his team and how much impact he'll have on football in general)

It's like an insane coincidence for a club to have all these things."
Tbh they seemed lost without Messi (plus some other vets) and needed time for the next generation to take over
"They still do, the ref did everything to keep them in the game today"
"Yeah, it was crazy watching Rudiger clipping Ferran from behind in the most obvious foul in the world but not getting even a var review. Also he was too hesitant with yellow in times when it was absolutely deserved, and kept calling stupid fouls while messing anothers. His performance today was an easy 0/10. Ironically, if RMTV didn't publish anything and waited for this clasico they would've had him showing the whole world how he is bad himself."
He is an awful referee and should never be put in charge of a game like this. Not awful against Madrid specifically but just awful in general. Feels like he’s literally flipping a coin any time he has to make a decision
Are you dumb? he was hesitant to give yellows to real madrid players
He's always offside
Glory to Pedri and Kounde
I second that!
La Liga administration when Rudiger tries to murder a ref:
"Ref actually had a very good game, considering the pressure being put on him"
hes about the worst of the bunch
bellingham a good lad ? 🤔
He the worst lmao
Haha he's one of if not the worst always whinging
Bellingham is probably the worst person in the football at this moment no joke. Crap person
"His kick accuracy is 100% only when Konate is around with a ball, other than that he’s shit"
I'd be more ashamed for the behaviour of some of these players towards the refs
"It was fine overall.

Maybe Barca could have had a pen and a few more Real yellows but nothing crazy."
"Probably no match ban, as it always been."
Mental illness.
"Barcelona did dominate the game for the first half.

Not sure what penalties Madrid would've gotten. Barcelona had 4 decent penalty claims turned down. I'd say it's crazy they didn't get at least 1 or maybe 2"
"Carlo can only do so much, it's really the Flo signings that made Madrid unbalanced"
this was our off day. we played like shit
"But ended with sportsmanship between the players, with the winners giving a ""pasillo"".

That was a nice picture to end the game. A lot of tension, drama, and nerves, but at the end it's sport. 

Too bad the same can't be said from Madrid's management..."
Koeman era clasicos were snoozefests if im being completely honest
"Yup, anything can happen, the run of form in the previous games hardly matters at all"
"Honestly, I happy as well. The way we played second half was the best performance we had this year."
"I feel like there was a period post-Messi at Barca where they lacked the same entropy, kinetic hatred, whatever, of the previous decade"
am I crazy for thinking that easily could be a red? The scissor action is leg breaking potential.
Rudiger seemed happy
Except its not lol
"No they lost the feed from Spain, the Internet feed was still going and they went to the studio"
"Hey, if any one of of the 2463 football services required to watch the sport here in Australia would show the final, we wouldn't have to stream the match."
At one point after the second cut out the English and Spanish commentary were playing simultaneously
"The Spanish one cut out for me so I has to go to Premier Sports.

But man the Spanish one is so hard to listen to with Kempes. He is soooo biased towards Real and against Barça it’s infuriating. Doesn’t even try to hide it"
No way they were gonna win after 3 pens got denied. Ball don't lie
Unironically yes
Might be entertaining for neutral but I dont want to clench my butt for three days
I love it too but both teams look tired as f
Hell nawl can’t do dis
Bout to steal some Emmys from Severance next year
Being victims
"- only two randomly disallowed penalties for Barca (no disallowed goals)  
- not getting any free penalties  
- Rudiger getting a red simply for throwing an object at the referee"
Didn’t you see rudiger at the end!?
Would be hilarious if it's the same ref too.
1 year ban from Copa del rey. Just in time for next year’s Round of 16
Wish I didn’t have to upvote this but it’s reality..
"Ancelotti is known for giving too much leeway to his players, thats why Vini and Bellingham also act like pricks"
Blud had a biting incident?! 😭🙏
Its cuz they are more likely to get away with dirty plays. Biggest example is Casemiro (fuck him)
This is real madrid heritage
"Even today Ancelotti did nothing to calm him or Vini down, when they were overreacting in the end. I understand that the adrenaline levels were high, but the team coach should control the bench and he looked like he couldn’t care less."
"it's a Madrid player, I wouldn't hold my breath"
And then yanking the icepack off his leg to have a go at it again. Should be two at least I think..... emphasis on should.
he did it respectfully my man
"Cause I saw both of those two storm out onto the pitch as if murder was committed

I've had to see Jude's whiny behaviour before he joined Real even, but he's just annoying at most"
"I actually like Mbappé as a player and person. So I don’t actively pray for his downfall or something. Hope he can step up his game in the coming years. Football needs players like him, Yamal and Ferran to be healthy."
"It is almost as sweet as seeing him score a hat trick and still not win the trophy 😃

Visca Barça!"
"The magic is usually the last 10 mins , the other 80 RM plays shit football."
"The most storied club in Europe acted like spoiled children this week, and really has this season, I think a lot of people were soured by their behavior"
"The reason they bully is because it works. It obviously worked today - handball pen, pulling Cubarsí on the corner pen, Ferran pen, and none of them were called"
The magic usually envolves a lot of bullshit calls from the refs
"They act like this literally all the time, have done for years. Pathetic club."
"It feels surreal to me. I genuinely don’t know what is happening within the club and I desperately miss the time where the club would never drop a word about referees. Whatever it is that is going on this season, I hate it."
"> normal Madrid fan 

A what?"
This and their crying about Rodri's Balon Dor win were peak levels of pathetic. No other club acts this way
"I'm fucking happy. Not so long ago, Barça was the laughing stock of the world (rightfully so!). Madrid were at the top, looking like a seriously well run club. And now this."
"Eric Garcia got nicked in the face and went down to win the foul. Then rudiger threw something (spool of tape?) seemingly at the ref. 

Has to be a massive ban."
"Mbappe caught garcia in the face (very lightly and garcia clearly made a meal out of it) and ref blew a free kick to us

Rudiger then tried to throw either a bottle or roll of sportstape at the reff (which is assault) wich led to the ref giving him a red.

Rudiger then picked up an ice pack and tried to enter the pitch to use the icepack to assault the ref and between 5-7 people had to hold him back"
The ref dared to give a foul against a RM player.
Mbappe put his fingers in garcias eyes. Ref whistled
Commentator saying he got angry over the decision from the ref
Think it was the reaction to the foul by Mbappe
Are you saying he had his sanity before that? Because like...
Implying he ever had the aformentioned sanity.
I would question whether he had that to begin with
"If I was the ref, I'd be fucking scared watching those Rudiger eyes. Genuinely looked like a psychopath for a second there, with 4 people holding him"
They weren't even hard done by. Barcelona would have won in 90 if Rudiger was called for clearly fouling Torres in the box at the end there. They should have had more yellows as well. Barcelona's penalty was overturned.
"RMTV’s antics this season remind me of Fox News, Perez reminds me of Trump, and the players remind me of Jan 6 rioters. They all so fully believe they’re victims and justified in insane actions"
They are in the cult of Perez
They also have to play tomorrow before our game Wednesday. So I hope it balances out.
"lets not get ahead of ourselves mate, they wear white"
Those Raphinha missed were really awful. And Olmo finishes his chance 9 out of 10 times. Just got too comfortable to try to finish the match.
"Well well well, they play in 14 hours"
they are playing tomorrow so not really
Honestly I’m glad nobody is injured. A small miracle already against a side worse than Getafe.
90 minutes at the Bernabeu are relativistic.
What investigation. Its all out in the open.
So Football won.
"More importantly, *Real* lost, cheers for Atletico."
"I get it. He's played his contract for the same club he's always played for and the city he grew up in. It's not weird for him to look elsewhere, I mean I would do the same. Get paid (a fucking boatload) and live in Madrid.

I would be cool with him coming back tho at some point in the future.

Seriously we don't own him, go get paid and live in a dope city that's new and exciting. I totally get it"
"Dont forget the levers! All the lever jokes but that summer where we signed Lewy, Rapha, and Kounde was absolutely crucial."
Two 17 year olds ;) cubarsí!
He probably wouldn't have performed this badly if RMTV just kept quiet. He let all the pre-game pressure get to him and clearly favored Madrid.
"I didn't say he was biased, said he was shit mate."
0 reading comprehension lol
Don't forget the shark!
Yeah I think it was VAR who screwed up not the ref.
He let the pressure get to him and that was the issue. Why did he not even give yellow cards to the MMA from Madrid?
other than not punishing with any yellowa in the first half and the cubarsi pen yeah he was PERFECT 🤦🏻‍♂️
"I mean sure, from Madrids pov. He let them get away with so much. And the penalty shout in Ferran-rudiger incident, how did they not call that?"
"at least 2 penalties not given to barca and a red card to modric, but yea"
He is being ironic
I think he has been sarcastic
Birmingham flair
Just a standard real game then?
Hell no it wasn’t. So many missed calls and missed pen reviews. He let violent stuff fly way too much from both sides
Vinicius was the most mature Madrid player surprisingly
Because barca were shite during that time.
"The games during the Guardiola era and afterwards, were also mostly tension and very little football. 

And both teams were at their peak at that point."
so were the xavi era ones
Like a proper derby should
Two footed tackle. I have seen red given for those
Should be checked by VAR at least
Yeah they had to use video feed of Portuguese espn And overlaying with studio commentary.
"Yeah, only for Ale Moreno to drop the insightful remark that Yamal had been quiet the whole game, and Ian Darke being forced to reluctantly go along with him, despite having provided assists to both goals, and the second goal being literally a minute or 2 before the feed cut off"
Some tech got excited and kicked a wire
"I'm not fluent in Spanish so a lot of it just goes over my head lol. Didn't pick up on that. The English one just had so much feedback from thier mics, kept popping and rustling, was so annoying."
Imma be honest Kempes has actually been solid these past couple games in his analysis. He’s even called out bs that’s happened to Barça from referee decisions.
I bet you RM TV still gonna come out tomorrow with hours worth of footage about how they got robbed lmao
Fucks sake how was that shirt pull on cubarsi not called on the pk
I was literally sick the second the second half started man 😂 it was clear Ancelotti gave the instructions to win the game and honestly they played great in that half if it wasn’t for Ferran
"I won't be in a referee life I don't want, ur sick."
RMTV about to drop the Tsar Bomba of victimhood
"There was actually a disallowed goal though, first couple minutes of extra time"
"> Rudiger getting a red simply for throwing an object at the referee

Laughed hard. Thanks."
I thought real is allowed to abuse the refs. Per their state media it’s their god given right to intimidate refs.
"""Simply throwing an object at the referee""
Sanest VARdrid fan"
Rudiger not a red?
Did Rudiger threw tht?
"They don't act like it, they are."
"Might be misremembering, someone will have to confirm.

Edit: yep, he tried to bite Pogba at the Euros"
That's considered a sane season by Rudiger standards
[bit pogba during euro 2021](https://youtu.be/0Nt1lwWWi80?si=Od1AqPAdr7d-wNlJ)
Just annoying? Dudes a literal spoiled bitchy brat
"Bellingham had the 2nd worst fair play rating right last season after Vinicious... it's just his marketing image that makes him look ""cleaner""."
Bro tried to sneak Ferran in with mid players like Mbappe and Yamal smh
"Same, I actually don't think he's as much of a diva as he could be. Even in the dying minutes of this match, he wasn't throwing a fit unlike other Madrid players"
"I actually like Mbappé and I agree that he is very likeable guy and an amazing player but once someone plays for Real Madrid, I can't root for him especially since the Ballon d'Or disaster.

Same applies to Modric like when he plays for Croatia, he is one of my favourite players but I could only smile when he made that pass to Koundé tonight."
"Me too. Great respect for Mbappe. Always focused on the football, even if decisions don’t go his way. Scared the shit out of me when he came on. Just breezed past Martinez, the best CB for me this season, like he was invisible"
Same I also quite like Mbappe which is why I don't want to hear Madrid fans shit on him anymore after this game. This game just shows that if they have to pick one between him and Vini he is the right choice. He also doesn't throw a fit at the ref every time a call doesn't go their way.
I love Mbappe but don't like Madrid💔
You sneaked Yamal in there like we wouldn't notice
"I’m not a fan of either France or Madrid, but I’m with you.

I really like him and wish him the best. Right now, I’m hoping his team (whether club or country) doesn’t win anything, but if he moves to a club that isn’t full of cunts, I wouldn’t mind seeing them win something too."
"Barca did not exactly play champagne futbol, but eh we'll take it"
This week? That's just normal behaviour. When they win you just don't notice.
"It’s not only this season and RM doesn’t just get hated on because they are successful.

Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga is even more dominant than RM in the CL and yet German fans from other teams don’t hate them as much even though it’s obvious that most of their fans are tourists and plastic."
"Funniest shit you still got Bellingham complaining about the refs between the breaks, literally everything was going their way and they still complaining like what"
"Cubarsi was a penalty, the handball not. It was the supporting hand. 

Although I’d like to see again the Rudiger-Ferran incident. Seems to me that he was taking his feet on one of the replays. "
"They do this even when they’re winning, pathetic club"
"Honestly crazy, any other time I would be first in line to praise Florentino, but what the hell happened? GOAT president without a doubt, but its been so embarrassing the way the club is behaving lately"
"Madrid and Barça fans have been bickering at each other about how refs favor the other team, while the reality is they both are being massively favored over the other 18 teams in the league, for decades, but it had never gotten so institutional. I imagine every time a RMTV video drops many of you want to stick your heads in the sand out of pure embarrassment."
Atleti fans
He wanted to throw his ice pack too but his teammates stopped him
I can't wait for the ref to put something like going for the ball in his report
"Called the ref a ""son of a bitch"" in German as well"
"Funniest part is that that event cost Madrid legit a minute of time they could have used to score. They gave up at 3-2, full stop. Couldn’t be happier, fuck em lol"
Vini did the same
"Ehhh, Eric dived. We can call it what it is.


Still utterly unacceptable, disgraceful, and despicable from Rutiger though.


He should get banned for a long time, but it'll end up being only 1 game."
"I doubt there would be much of a ban since it's RM, Mbappe got a 1 game ban after that horror tackle the other game, so going by that very doubtful"
"Yup, like 24h ban"
One match is the best La Liga can do
He's such a twat
"Vini threw it as well Rüdiger, but I think the ref only saw Rüdiger's."
"Not that it justifies the reaction, but it was never a foul"
Garcia dived (not that it excuses any of Rudigers actions).
"He really looked like he would have assaulted the referee if he wasn't being held back, hopefully Madrid's kit man survives the next week."
"Every time I see players needing to be held back like that it just blows my mind. Its a game of football for fuck sake, such actions shouldn't get your to the stand they should get you to jail"
He looked like a psychopath for 30ish second not just for a second
Barca penalty was rightfully overturned imo but it is funny that’s the only time VAR intervened the whole match IIRC.
"Madrid are emblematic of everything that is wrong with the world currently, disgusting club"
"I’ve made the same exact connection as well, insane how the most powerful always makes themselves out to be underdog victims of persecution."
Reddit really manages to make everything about US politics
"Olmo was weird, there were like 2 times when he got the ball in a good position and then he fell asleep."
"Olmo honestly surprised me, he has shown multiple times that he knows how to finish with his left and still didn’t go for it. I guess he wanted to go for the safe choice but he should be experienced enough to know that time like that doesn’t exist."
"And an abysmal first half from Martin, way too many mistakes"
"Maybe it helped that he'd been subbed out a while before the end of the game? Either way, it was a really positive and surprising sight to see"
"Where was he mature? There are plenty others that were actually mature in the squad. Maybe you mean he was more civilized than how usually is, but thats not saying much."
Not really. Just look at he the scores and they were never that bad. They were complete snoozefests for neutrals
"To be really honest, barca were never really shite when it came to clasicos"
even Real Madrid were in a way
Dont say you werent moved by that late match winner from Kessie or that 0-4 at the Bernabeu
That's funny.
This game almost gave me a bigger heart attack than the 2022 WC final. What a game!
RMTV > AFTV
You missed the sarcasm
Can't blame Rudi. Pogba does look kinda tasty.
"I’m not going to lie, you got me in the first half."
"Yeah, the guy locks in when the match starts to show him chances. Guy scared me in the WC final."
"At the dying minutes after Kounde scored, he was the only player I was scared could turn the tides again. He has that kind of X factor. Fortunately it didn't come to pass. 

The rest were busy complaining."
I’m a Barcelona fan… I’m biased as fuck. Sue me. A man can hope and pray for his club players success.
They were very good for the first half and a good portion of the second half. Tired legs got to them.
"It’s because they think so highly of themselves that if they’re not winning, it must be someone else’s fault. I’ve never seen such uncomfortable faces as when they went down 2-0 to Arsenal in the first leg. It was like their brains couldn’t comprehend what was happening."
"> It was the supporting hand.

That's what I presumed it had to have been but I have to see the rule exactly bc idk if it's a supporting hand if the hand isn't on the ground. Rudiger absolutely just swiped Ferran's planted foot."
"Honestly feel like its been even worse this season than before, with both the Bałon d'or and this event + preceedings taking major highlights. Though more has happened"
"It's just a smokescreen. Let's be honest, Real played really badly this whole season, suffering in almost every game, no matter who they play. On top of that they got seriously whopped by Barca twice.

The whole ref narrative and the complaigns about schedules etc. etc. is just to distract from the abysmal form of the team. If people would be fair about judging how Real performs this season, they would quickly realise that Floro totally fumbled january transfer window."
No you mean Rayo fans
"> Atleti fans

You managed to pick the one team who's supporters are actually worse than Madrid ones"
yes the guys hanging manaquins tied to nooses dressed as opposing teams players and chanting monkey noises at black players every single game are certainly normal
"He looked like he was literally going to assault the ref if he wasn't held back, and it didn't seem like a fake ""hold me back"". Even crazier eyes than usual."
"""he was going for the ball"". One game suspension, apologies from the ref for being in the way of his throw"
"Did he at least scream ""SPRICH DEUTSCH"" before that?"
I got no love for Barca but I'm almost as over the moon as I was ten days ago
"1 match would be fine, after all its Real Madrid they cant give them more even if they would want to"
"Should be banned, I think he threw something at the ref"
It’s just insane that it’s real and they keep doubling down on it. Every fanbase thinks they’re wronged by the refs but what Madrid is doing through official channels is hard to believe and honestly seems to be affecting their players’ mindset
Nah its spot on. Comparing Real Madrid in football to Trump and his cult in politics is a perfect analogy.
"I’m not one who tries to bring it into anything really, but this one just feels in the face to me. It was the reaction to the ref being continuing to attack him vs apologizing that football became personal and was impacting his family that made me connect the two"
"That is his level, I'm surprised Madrid didn't pressure him more

Unfortunately the weak link in the current Barca team"
Nah he’s always cordial with opponents after the game
"One thing Barca knows is to show up for the Clasico, form doesn’t matter they’ll leave it all on the pitch."
"yes barring that one game the rest were mostly snoozefests or borderline terrible for us, especially the later ones"
That made me laugh out loud!  😂😂😂😂
"He did nothing for 75 minutes in that final, and then he woke up and turned it into the greatest game of football ever"
"💯 not gonna lie, I ragequit and took our dog out for a walk when France equalized in the final. could only follow the rest of the game via my husband messaging me score updates 😬"
Grateful that Rudiger and Vini's shenanigans wasted most of the added time 🙏
"Having an injury on Balde is honestly what got us, he is soooo underrated for us with how he literally holds a whole side by himself basically with how much centrally raphinha drifts. The downgrade from him to Martin is absolutely insane which make us rely on the right too much and get predictable."
"The ball was behind the body posture, which never translates to a penalty. But the other two...im not sure what game VAR was overlooking."
We’ve had worse seasons and still wouldn’t behave in such a pathetic way. I’m honestly so disappointed with the current state of the club.
"Nah because every fucking game seems like such a hurdle for them, the last time they actually beat down a ""good team"" was in the ucl knockouts against limped dick man city lol"
"Well, they're not worse in every way e.g., there's fewer of them so that's good."
">chanting monkey noises at black players every single game are certainly normal

Is there really a lot of club in Europe that can escape that accusation tho"
Yea it took three dudes to hold him back. He was going to do some damage
Their behavior on and off the field unironically made Barcelona a more likable team in this matchup
Naah. Nothing is going to happen
They wrote and enacted their own villain arc unprompted and I think that's beautiful.
He got sent off at least
Well that's the benchmark for Madrid
"**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**
  

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
Can’t wait to see what statements Madrid cook up to defend these actions
Lengthy suspension warranted but I wouldn't be surprised if it's only 1 game
Unhinged man lol
"It was ice, no? From the ice bandaged round his leg?

Should be an extremely long ban for him."
This would get you stadium ban if you were a fan caught doing this - has to be a proper punishment
"Threatening the ref before, during, and after the match. What a bunch of cunts"
Not right in the head the both of them
"Love how frustrated they are,just inject it in my veins"
Should be a 10+ game ban
The villains lose
The biggest cry baby players in the world. The sense of entitlement that the Real Madrid players have is astounding. Just garbage players.
Fucking psychopath
Get fucked lmao
"Whenever Real loses,football wins"
Football won today
"I might get crucified for this, but Carlo is part of the issue. Look at him just standing there. He's an enabler. He's been enabling this sort of behaviour for years. From Rüdiger, from Jude, from Carvajal, from Vini. Entitled and spoiled, bratty cunts that act out whenever things don't go their way. Carlo is the boss. Part of his responsibility is to create a healthy atmosphere and culture in the dressing room. Not only has he allowed such a toxic culture to grow, he's stood by completely idly while these guys have been acting more and more out of line. His non-invasive management is definitely part of what has created this issue with these players."
Everton has been deducted 9 points
Disgusting cunt.
Genuine sociopath
Shameless club and Shameless players. Embarrassing
"Still probably will get only one game ban, because somehow refs will deem he was trying to play the ball or it slipped out of his hand or some shit."
hes just giving a watter bottle for the ref cause hes tired
It wasn't clear at first why the ref gave Rudiger a red. But these angles showing an object thrown and It's by Rudiger.
We get it you’re crazy bro…smh. Grown man.
Should be getting a long ban for that
"This cunt escapes so many cards on the field, so fucking glad this happened.  
Definitely looked like he was gonna murder the ref there."
Haven't seen such meltdown since Chernobyl reactor no.4
"Pathetic bitch, bet he goes home and cries about it"
Never seen a bunch of more dislikeable cunts than this Madrid side.
Ancelotti does nothing. Does he even notice?
“probably”? lmao
"Typical Vinicius reaction after dropping a 2/10 performance.

Not gonna say anything about Rudiger, absolutely no words..."
fonseca banned for much less
Ban him from all the remaining games this season.
The video just got nuked rip
"They are actually attacking the refs mid game with violence now. That is crazy. 

Should be a lengthy ban."
Classless club all around
"Very well adjusted individuals, as per usual"
The Spanish FA needs to put their foot down and give out massive punishments. This shit is going to get out of control unless you stomp it out.
Bunch of whiny kids
probably? lol
"Video flagged by troIIs so no one could easily watch it, how nice, how reddit-like"
The Draymond Green of football
Carlo has absolutely lost the dressing room. His man management is basically non existent now. Embarrassing behavior from grown ass players who are getting paid millions.
"Rudiger and Bellingham, two of Madrid's dirtiest players but the other gets saved from PR."
Such a toxic culture in that club. Any other league would’ve sanctioned them to pieces for what they do.
Throw object on pitch 1 match ban. Touch you nose 3 match
"I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a more-petulant, self-absorbed bunch of pricks. I’m thrilled that my club dumped them out of “their” precious UCL and almost as happy to see them miss out on the Cops del Rey as well. I can usually find some grudging respect for other, more-successful clubs, but I have nothing but scorn for this clown show."
Has there ever been a bigger bunch of bitches to wear that white jersey?
psychopath needs to be banned from playing football for life
Rudiger would be doing dumb shit if it wasn’t for football
Whiny manbabies.
He should be in a mental asylum rather than on a football pitch.
Real Madrid have the biggest victim mentality in football I swear to god.
"Referee’s official report:

1st official was thirsty, player #22 for Real Madrid provided water. 

Rüdiger receives one get-out-of-jail-free card."
Them being sore losers make the win taste that much better
Rudiger should be banned for 12 months for that. absolutely unacceptable behavior.
The team is full of entitled pricks. Look at them casually stroll into the pitch.
"Real Madrid is a fucking disgusting club.
Threating refs before, during and after the game.

Multiple Madrid players throwing stuff at the ref?

Rudiger should receive a serious quarantine for this, it looks like he throws the ice from his bandage as well towards the ref, and it was actually  very close to hitting the ref."
Good guy Vini and quirky Rudi
On God they're so unlikable
Joke of a club
Classless club. Just a sad sad club.
Thinking you are getting robbed after such a game is insane
"unhinged cunts, that whole club

""Unfortunately"" they never get properly punished"
"Sunday League mentality, take the L boy."
Rudiger is an ass. Plain and simple. Man is going to end someone's career. Reckless player without class.
These motherfuckers get mad because another team throws themselves on the floor and ask for fouls. How many times this team wastes time using “dark arts”. Fuck these cunts.
Statement incoming how the referees are targeting Real Madrid and not allowing them throw things at referees when every other club does it
There needs to be something done about this. These Madrid players think they’re above the law. There’s been so many disgusting acts by all of these players this season with no discipline.
Bloke was going to throw ice bags until Madrid players and coaches hooked his arm. He was ready to throw it several times too. 1 game suspension tops for them all cause the league protect the team that makes them revenue
"Such likeable players, playing at the most likeable club."
"Suspend and fine, these actions at the highest level of football should be punished."
Is Trent really joining this team?
"Madrid fan but vini and rudiger need to grow the fuck up, vini esp needs to stop making a scene like a entitled 5 year old everytime things dont go his way."
"Unlikable, disrespectful bunch of twats. Referee already did all in his power to help you win, what do you want more? No red card to challenge against Pedri and then 2 %100 clear penalties not given back to back as well. They literally tried to rob Barca blind but at the end lost anyways. Love to see them get beaten in every corner."
"there's also a video of him assaulting a kitman a few months ago, he is really a piece od shit"
"Any other team, they both would get 5+ game bans...but it's Real Madrid so they will get a slap on the wrist."
"I've always respected Real Madrid because of the Galacticod era and the Zidane Manager era.

But this season, they have shown their true dark colours. What a bunch of cry-baby cunts.

I hate them now more than ever.

I hope Barca once again decimated them on May 11th. Humiliate these annoying cunts.

They have not a single grain of professionalism."
"God, RM must be the most entitled and idiotic Club in the World... So many hateable players..."
Lolol and Madrid will whine about the refs when they got bailed out hard…
This is embarrassing. 🤣. But I'm here for it. 😭
Such an unlikable club
At this point not even a meme or whatever anymore guy is going to cause someone serious harm some day.
He knows he can get away with murder now that it's the final. Missing a match or two in the early next season doesn't matter.
"Absolutely deserving of a multiple match ban, gets away with far too much shit"
He looks like a crazy horse with broken knees who needs to be put to sleep
Typical Madrid hooligans. It's been part of their DNA since forever
Thanks. I definitely needed reminding of why I absolutely despise Real Madrid.
Insert Kyrgios reply “ it slipped out of my hand “
"These guys just cannot handle losing, can they? It's embarassing"
"Flo: Madrid is appealing the suspension of Rudiger and Vinicius because the ref clearly wasn’t falling for our shit.

For a club that’s won so much, they’re terrible losers. No class."
"the entitlement of vini and whoever else went onto the pitch, RM are actually an embarrassment to football"
and everyone’s big bad “Don” is letting it happen
How someone like rudiger is still allowed to play is beyond me
Love watching them lose
1 game ban max because of the you know who.
How long will they enable this entitled mug?
"Competition sometimes brings out the best out of people and enables them to transcend their previous limitations.


And then there's just people like Rudiger. Pretty rare to see shit stacked that high."
"More like *Rude*iger, am I right?"
"This video was flagged for violating our [Community Guidelines](https://streamable.com/community-guidelines)

why?"
I don't like either RM or Barca but fuck me seeing the way both teams acted today just made me a Barca supporter for every upcoming Clasico.
"Should be banned for few months
https://cedirates.com/news/ghanaian-player-banned-one-year-for-beating-referee-with-stones/"
"Post in r/realmadrid *""The referee was impartial and made small mistakes on both sides today, but overall was very good.""*

Absolutely shameless fanbase

To their credit, they acknlowledged that Rudigers behaviours towards the end was horrible - but thats like the bare minimum.

I'm not sure If I'm allowed to link to them but you can check it out for yourself."
Isn't this the same club who had a horror red card reduced to 1 match? Why are they always crying?
"I hope the referee can see all the love the players he was protecting have for him. They are despicable bullies. Even if you bow to go kiss their feet, they will kick you in the mouth. 12 match ban for every Barça player incoming for triggering Rüdiger. I hate these scum, and I'm glad they lost."
Ronaldo pushed a ref and got 6 games ban soo if he doesn’t get at least 10 then ……
"""suspended for 45minutes"""
"disgusting headloss, deserved a lengthly ban for sure"
Least unhinged Rudiger moment
"Good arm from the cunt tbf, had the ref stayed where he was and didnt move it probably hits him. Pathetic scenes."
Why was he still allowed on the pitch afterwards?
Madrid are a disgrace.
Imagine wanting to go to this club lol
I don’t care for either team really but I’m so happy Barcelona won
Probably? What?! He DEFINITELY threw it.
Ah yeah and they wonder why refs do interview now
La liga is Spanish WWE lol
"Not surprising, always been an unhinged cunt"
Rudiger and Spanish football is a match made in heaven
With mentor like this i understand penicius animal behavior.
"Honestly if they keep going like this for 1 more month, i wouldn’t be surprised if we see a FIFA-level action against RM. Old man lost his mind"
"Throwing a chunk of ice at the referee or any human for that matter (and clearly aiming for it as wel) can break bones. Doing it while you work and get paid € 280.000 weekly is absurd. Under any normal circumstances, you would get fired for attempted assault.  but I'm sure over 2 weeks he will be on the field again complaining to referees."
What's sweeter than today's victory is the grand exposé of this corrupt club!
"Rüdiger is such an piece of shit, he really wants Pepe’s crown"
"Rudiger, a lunatic."
"As a madrid fan, I'm ashamed to see our players behave like this. I don't like to say this, because rudiger is our best defender by far this season but he needs to banned for the rest of the season or banned for minimal 3 matches. His behaviour is so unhinged. As for vini, he needs to grow up or leave, because his acting as a spoilt child needs to stop. It doesn't help his performance and it only will stain his career. We will be stronger again, but we need to change a lot."
Most unnecessary crashout
I will never understand why this team of world class complainers is considered prestigious
(Off target)
This Madrid team is full of so many giant babies
Bunch of cry babies
Fucking entitled cunt. This guy has some serious mental issues
He’s the football version of Isaiah Stewart
A team full of entitled cunts
"Anything less than a healthy ban, I would refuse to officiate games as a collective groups of refs. 

Referees can be shit sometimes but there has to be a baseline or respect and adult behaviour. 

You cannot have 6 foot 5 athletes, displaying threatening behaviour like this towards someone simply doing their job. Clubs need to control their players. 

If I behaved like that anywhere professionally, I’d be fired the same day. So far beyond acceptable. "
"Probably? GTFO. 

He fucking threw it."
The biggest bunch of privileged babies in the world sport.
Glad the putoblancos lost the Cup 😂
Absolute garbage club with such a loser’s mentality. They’ve always been entitled but this shit is beyond insane.
Real are really showing who’s the title holder between the match of the two most entitled clubs and fan bases. Real can’t ever handle their comeuppance.
"Disgraceful, doesn’t matter how bad the game was you should never resort to violence especially as a grown man who gets paid millions even if he did lose"
"NGL hope he gets a lengthy ban, that's a really stupid thing to do and he had to be restrained by team staff too, hope the club punishes him hard for that even after he serves his ban."
I swear Real Madrid are a stain on this sport...
This headloss will feed me for months
Generational hatewatch
Way to be classy
Ancelotti should be the one taking most of the blame for all of this BS this season. Wtf is going on at the club?
"Trent, you sure want to join this shitshow? I mean, I guess you’ll be rich so it’s whatever, but still."
Ban this mf till 2026-27 season
What a disgraceful club they are. Cannot accept losing fair and square.
The serial killer community lost a real one when it turned out Rudiger was good at soccer
We all know he'll only get 1 match ban because the next one will be another El Clasico
Rudiger belongs in certain organisations :)
"Rüdiger and Vini (for the right money) should both leave to Saudi in the summer 

Absolute clowns and Ancelotti can't and won't keep them in check"
Ban incoming for referee for pissing Rudiger off. How dare they can do that
Fucking despicable man. Your club intimidates the ref then you physically assault him? Ban these fuckers from next year's cup entirely this is getting ridiculous. They need to understand that they aren't in charge here.
3 game ban for Lewandowski 👃🏻
Proper Chelsea behavior
"absolutely no class from these lot, it's gonna be absolutely glorious if we go 4/4 against them this year"
I’m loving this headloss
fucking embarassing. get his out of realmadrid
I am embarrassed. See yall next season fellas.
This is .... one game ban
One game ban.
"those are at least 3 red cards at once lol, this will give a very hefty ban"
Disgusting mentality at Madrid
This is pure cinema
Best I can do is 2 matches appealed down to 1.
"I was mad at the referee too but on a sporting level. This is borderline bullying at this point on a personal level. I won’t be surprised if this ref legit quits or goes into depression. Getting slandered during the game is bad but expected but before and probably after? 

If Real just showed sportsmanship before and during this game, nobody would have really mocked them and in fact commended them for fighting back against Barca despite all odds, but they had to shoot themselves in their own foot."
Team filled with cunts. 
"I'm a Liverpool fan. But...

*Real Madrid need to remember the uniform.* It may be hated... but always respected.

This thuggery stands as an affront to those wearing it in the past."
If not for those 3 guys he would have been banned for life and in jail..
1 match ban
He's gonna get a 1st half ban for that
Evil has lost today
"Entitled pricks, top to bottom"
C*nt’s gonna c*nt
Can we just ban both of them please.
Nothing to see here.Nothing will happen
Scum bag team.
"Florentino Perez is collecting Galacticos, but this time with unprofessional players"
Rudi completely lost it
"I want this guy out of the club, he’s too unhinged."
What the fuck is wrong with our players for God’s sake
Ugly club they are
"Should be some game bans, this isn't ok."
Need more angles on this one
he is mentally deranged
"You can safely remove that ""probably"" from the title brother"
Embarrassing from Rudiger. His behaviour is unhinged.
"Absolute shameless behaviour.
Pathetic from players and the entire club"
Crazy stuff.
"Time to end this farce. Ban Madrid from next year's participation. They do it again, ban them the year after, too. Until there are real consequences this shit will never stop."
"""probably"" lol yeah I'd say a probability of 100%"
If this will not get a heavy punishment it will create a dangerous precedent
"I’m sure he’ll get banned from one match. After all, he’s wearing white"
"This kinda says it all about Ancelotti time at the moment. He lost the team completely, a coach in charge of the team would never allow these reactions from the players."
"RealJilling, not Real Madrid. Fuckers"
He was throwing very harsh german insults too. Like 10x in a row you can read it from his lips
I don't even have a La liga team but I'm so glad they lost lol
"Should be lengthy ban, but probably nothing and then wonder why there's a chronic shortage of referees."
I think a fair punishment is for Vazquez to start every match next season.
And I have to watch this psychopath playing for my country. I'm disgusted.
Bunch of crybabies harassing the refs the entire fixture. Nothing will happen to them because Perez made the call!
What a dumbass.
Gotta respect the aim
Entitled shit players
"What an embarrassment. Complainers and moaners now this. Man, RM fans should be ashamed of their team and club for the slander they’ve put out recently. Disgraceful"
I think both Rudiger and Vini should be announced as joint Ballon D’or winners!
What was he saying to the refs?
"This kind of behavior from players should be strongly condemned to make sure it doesn't happen again. I understand emotions can run high during a match, but this is pure aggression that creates a dangerous precedent for the future."
Horrible player from a horrible club
What a bunch of sore losers
Real Madrid will need a manager that will demand respect and authority. I don’t like targeting Vini but he always seems to be at the centre of everything bad about Madrids attitude and behaviour
this will improve their already flourishing reputations
1 match ban incoming! Mark my words
"As a famous tennis player once said…

“It slipped out of my hand”"
Biggest bunch of absolute fanny's.
He's a Real Madrid player so max 1 game suspension
I can't wait for the RMTV video justifying this
"Ref was obviously thirsty. Rudiger saw that and threw him some ice, and then very respectfully said drink that ice bro, don't get a heat stroke.... at night"
"""Poor refereeing performance led to these reactions""

And then they go and abuse the next referee in charge of a classico and act shocked when the referee comes out saying he's being harassed. And r/realmadrid also act entitled and shocked"
"No matter what he did, he did it WITH RESPECT"
He's being hailed as hero by Madrid media
Can’t wait for RFEF to do nothing
"Ref report: «Rudiger wanted to drink, bottle slipped from his hand »"
He actually threw it respectfully
"remember, mbappe changed the game for madrid and he only played cuz of his 1 match ban"
"Madrid's kit man will not survive the next week, someone needs to crowdfund for his protection."
How about ban him for the club. Wtf is he doing. Just so unnecessary especially when the ref didnt do anything wrong. We were lucky not to concede a pen before.
Ref's report says he made an attempt at getting the ball so no worries
"1 game?

Are you kidding me?

*RFEF recinds Rudigers red card upon review Tuesday*"
"Laughable if this isn't made a statement. It's actually towards a ref this time and not a career ender so it should be more serious consequences (yes it's not football, it's la liga but this is how it works)"
You should be surprised if they get suspended at all
"""he was only trying the pass his extremely dehydrated teammate a water bottle, we find it repulsive that you would think other wise and not care for the well being of our players"" some bullshit like that"
"Ban? Lmao ofc not, the ref didn't even die.. biggest /s of my life"
"No suspension. real will do their magic and it will automatically be forgiven

Fuck those bastards"
At this point I can even imagine the ref being banned for standing in the way of his throw
I'm surprised they didn't award Madrid a penalty as an apology.
This shouldn't be surprising to anyone. He's been an unhinged piece of shit for a long time. He just tends to get away with stuff so he doesn't have a huge reputation.
Even Ancelotti looked embarrassed
"Tuchel deserves a lot of credit for coaching Rüdiger to play clean at Chelsea. 

He had one collision with KdB and (i think?) a biting incident if I'm remembering correctly.  But that was pretty much it. 

Ever since he's moved to Madrid idk what it is but clearly he's been given free reign to be as dirty as possible."
Fucking thug
Rudiger is a legit psycho and I can’t be convinced otherwise
"It's Real Madrid, nothing will happen."
Ban for what? He saw that the ref was thirsty and acted accordingly. /s
"Lmao, Mbappe got a 3 game ban reduced to 1 game for a leg breaker. I doubt this will result in anything *especially* if RM don't get punished for the whole Ref drama beforehand"
"That's my guess too, specially because of how far the object travels."
1 game ban incoming
"Valverde once waited for a player and punched him in the parking lot, and nothing happened lol"
"1 game, he was going for the ball"
"Yes. I am guessing that he didn't throw the initial bigger ice ball. Whoever did that should suffer a ban as well. And if it turned out he threw both, the ban should probably include part of next season."
Nah you see he didn't touch his nose so it's okay
"No, this was a bottle. After the red he tried to throw his icepads"
If he wasn’t stopped by his teammates he probably would have been banned for life.
Basically like throwing a rock. The speed and distance of it showed it could have done some damage.
That's a good point. A fan does this and they are probably banned for a very long time. Why should a player who is on the sideline be any different?
"In Australia, a fan has just been banned for 2 years for throwing a folded up paper poster at a player."
Kreisliga mentality
Biggest club in the world comprised of absolute children all around
"Also insulting him as a ""Hurensohn"", translated to son of a bitch, but in german it's a much harsher insult than in english."
"I fucking hate this team so much.

  
They always act so small for such a big club"
I saw some Madrid fans in that thread saying we should blame the club not the players. No mate. They’re all cunts. The mentality exists from the fans all the way to the top. Fuck Madrid.
"Watch them unleash further propaganda against the ref.

Even though he actually was way more in favour for them. Now that they lost, they'll make it about him."
they thought Franco was back in charge
Only club to have multiple TV channels and papers to hound referees on regular basis
"Yeah, but they can use Rudiger's red card in the last minute where he is on the bench to justify why they lost in the match, not because they are bad but because ref screws them"
Couldn’t agree more
The fact that the whole pre match ref fiasco worked and this guy threw something at the ref that favoured them the entire match
"Loser mentality. Hopefully, they won see any trophies this season. Cunts."
Apparently they are “classy”.
"Don't say that for Vini, he will call you racist. One of the most unlikeable players I've ever had the pleasure to watch"
Why are y'all acting like Vini was the only one on the pitch?
should add a few more for threatening the ref before the match. Rudiger should take one for the team. lol
"""Best I can do is a warning"" RFEF"
"Add the ""Hurensohn"" (son of a whore) to it."
"I don't even understand what they're mad about. Half the time they were furiously asking for handballs that weren't. If anything felt like the ref was kind for them, could've given Barcelona a penalty or two."
"I wouldn't be surprised if I learned Rudiger has murdered someone lmao

He's completely deranged"
a serial killer if he hadn't played football
"He was trying to get more ice after being shown the red, btw."
Don’t hear anyone say that when players get choked by other players. 
Can't believe Trent wants to be a part of this clown show.
We won the title and generational crashout by RM...this is every barca fan's dream
Rightfully so
100% People praise how calm and collected he is but Flick will tear shit up if his players pull a fraction of that shit and it's not unusual for him to drop stars for disciplinary stuff too. Ancelotti's man management is very overrated as we can very damningly see here.
Here's how Ipswich can sill survive relegation.
Ocon +10 sec
"Exactly, La Liga has said they want to protect the refs. Rudiger is literally providing water to the ref after a long game. I think Lewa should be banned for 3 games, he did nothing."
it just slipped ofc
"I don't understand why he has the label classy, he seems to have lost it 2 seasons ago."
For legal reasons. RMTV are dangerous.
ShOuLd HaVe WoN tHe BaLlOn D'oR
lol this 10x boy is overrated af
Always have been mate
They should have done this when RM made that statement. I would never expect Liverpool TV or Arsenal TV to do the same thing.
Madrid under Mourinho was one of the worst although they had legendary players.
"The more they forgive these attitudes from their players, the more severe will be whatever makes change happen."
Just Rudiger and Vasquez apparently. Could’ve sworn Vini got one… he deserved one
They got 4 reds tonight.  Let’s see what the bans are lol
because it showed madrid being dickheads ig
And a red for Casemiro
He seems to not behave as bad for Germany or Chelsea for example
"""Rudiger was trying to catch the ice with his mouth but the ref got in the way!"""
I am tired. Roberto
RMTV are gonna go full Fox News with this
Top ten respect moments in football
RM were really upset that VAR didn't step in to award the penalty against them at 90 +4'. Their commitment to fair refereeing incensed them against this injustice.
"I just went to that subreddit, and I do not see them acting the way you described. All of the upvoted comments are reasonable takes."
"Referee wanted to drink water, Rudiger provided"
Ahh the nick Kyrgios defence
Real TV will make a whole documentary about slippery water bottles
Ah I see rudiger went to the nick kryrios school of drinking water.
"Also, penalty for Real Madrid"
In fact he was only going for the ball
We went from Milan will pay for this to the kit man lol
"He looks absolutely unhinged in this clip, bro needs to be sedated and sent to a psych ward"
It’s crazy how the media will talk about the foul that led to this and not the pens VAR missed.
Perez should ban him for the rest of the games. This kind of behavior can't be seen in a club of Madrid's stature
">the ref didnt do anything wrong


The ref did fall for Eric Garcia's dive right before this. (Which absolutely doesn't excuse Rudiger's actions.)"
"Nah, it’s just a 1 match ban so he is rested for El Clasico part 3."
“The player on the field still didn’t see the bottle after gently providing it in the first place so he just wanted to go get the bottle to be able to still give it to his very thirsty teammate”.
"He's allowed to get away with anything on the pitch.

Once he's out, it seems refs are not able to excuse his antics."
Yeah Papa Flo prot€cts him
"Ngl, such behaviour in the league should warrant a suspension from the national team"
And then he doesn’t do a damned thing about it.
"Just a casual bitting incident, as normal human being do"
"> He had one collision with KdB

That 'collision' was Rudiger throwing his shoulder into KDBs face when the ball was already long gone. Broke KDBs face and fucked up his CL and WC. And IIRC Rudiger got away with it too.

Watch the replay, it's intentional. This guy does this shit all the time, I hate players like that."
"Real Madrid saw Rudiger take out the opponent's star player in a CL final and knew that Rudiger was the perfect Ramos replacement. 

That's why Trent's situation is not just about leaving your boyhood club at the end of the contract on a free, he is leaving to the team that knocked them out of the CL 4 times in 6 years,. a team that resorts to some fucked up things like harassing referees and how Ramos/Rudiger/Pepe assault people, Vini and his entire crew and fanbase crying like babies after missing out on Ballon d'Or "
I hated his sorry ass since then. Garbage human being with refs on his boss's payroll.
He is a bitch not a thug.
"Cunt is what he is, thug feels a bit loaded"
"Most likely just a ban for the copa del rey cup next season, not affecting the league whatsoever.

Am I guessing correctly?"
"One game ban at most, Mbappe style."
Thats what happens when 2 of the 3 people deciding ban lengths have worked for Real Madrid
Plus the ice will melt so there will be no evidence!
"Game was heated, he just thought things needed to cool down"
good guy rudiger
For the referee 
"Surely the parking lot counts as international waters, right?"
"They went to court over that and it was proven that what the player said that happened didn't match what the camera on the parking lot said, what would you expect to happen?"
"I don't know how this is in other league - but in Austrian non league football, if you get a red card, you have to call officials a few days later, explain the situation. if it's because of a failed last effort tackle or sth, then this is no problem, but

if you did something like Rüdiger there, then you are seriously in trouble"
"Children mostly dont behave like this, only scumbags"
Boys who spent so much time doing nothing else but playing football they forgot to grow up.
"Galácticos would never, they had some class"
Top to bottom they are like this. It can't be a mistake at this point. One of the richest clubs in the world and they don't want to pay transfer fees. One of the best clubs in the world and they want unfair advantages. One of the most successful clubs and their fans boo and whistle when they don't win every game. Absolutely entitled.
"Goes to show that this kind of problem comes from the top. If the leadership is rotten, hardly everything else wouldn't be as well"
Draco Malfoy energy
Funny how our team acts more mature here when we’re literally playing high schoolers and college freshmen on our starting 11
Yeah my three year old is more respectful and understands right from wrong better than they do.
"If they were just normal too it'd be hard to hate them but they're the most entitled brats in football. 


The Ballon D'Or stuff and then pretty much everything since. "
"Is it like whoreson, that fine old Shakespearean insult? I MISS IT."
The kind of insult that should only be reserved for Timo Werner and Dietmar Hopp
"Son of a whore, not bitch"
"I'm pretty sure I also caught a ""Missgeburt"", but not certain."
"i'd translate it as ""son of a whore"", ""son of a bitch"" is to casual like you said."
CSGO staple.
Bullies with a victim complex.
Exactly... If you wander in madrid sub every comment will reveal that they are entitled cunts.
I genuinely don’t get what he’s mad about. If he pulled out a pistol and shot barcas front 3 they still wouldn’t be satisfied.
We just ignoring the guy on the left as well?
I mean Vinicius does get a lot of racist abuse. He's a twat but both things can be true.
Vini can be a cunt and also a victim of racism.
The pleasure to watch lose*
"He still receives endless amounts of racist abuse, just because you don’t like him there’s no reason to downplay that"
"Bro I’m a Barca fan and we had shit fans chanting muerte Vini before the game. He does get racist threats, and he’s also a cunt - two things can happen without you needing to downplay the racist hatred him and almost all other black players receive in Spain. Do better"
Say up to a year match ban. Then reduce to a 1 week ban.
Imagine a CB pairing of him and Mancini
">I wouldn't be surprised if I learned Rudiger has murdered someone lmao

This comment perfectly encapsulates the ridiculous drama around these two teams."
he still has time
"This team's fans booed Kaka,Bale even Ronaldo,hell they booed Mbappe this year.

Trent will get crucified there.

Best of luck to him,but i kinda want to see how he'll react when that inevitably happens."
shame it was at the cost of so much energy but on the other hand the crash out wouldn't have been so grandiose if we cooked them from the start
This is always the added bonus when you beat a rival. The crash out is just so extra sweet to watch lol
The real question is if this is a worse crashout than the one after the Arsenal game ? I believe it is lmfao
"Got to coach a team of wankers though. Hard to single out players. Although he is gone in the summer, it would be great to see the old boy tear into them for this disgrace."
catching strays everywhere
"Probably genuinely has given up with a squad consisting of psychopaths, criminals and straight up arrogant assholes."
Barca One TV will never do this.
"Are you sure about Vini and Bellingham?
Sofascore and Flashscore says its only red to Rudiger and Vasquez"
"Honestly, they were lucky they were even allowed to play with the actions of their club before the game."
"Before the game when they wanted the referee changed they agreed with the club that the referee should be changed because it wasn't fair he commented on the harassment he received from the club.

Not sure what posts you're reading if you can't find that."
+3 points to Real Madrid in Laliga
1 match suspension rescinded
Real Madrid is looking at the kit man with anger in their eyes. The mood in the locker room is one of vengeance.
Agreed. I hate to see this attitude of completely losing the plot when things dont go your way. We are the most successful club so we should afford to show some grace.
Draymond Green vibes. After the first technical of the game he gets away with everything.
3 and a half million karma lad what in the actual fuckballs your condition is terminal holy shit
"Seriously. No one's saying he's got to be a strict disciplinarian, but this is too lax."
Feeling cute gonna bite
Well anyone can make a mistake once
Suarez approves.
Yea it was pretty brutal ngl. Should have been a red.
"Him getting away with that was fucking insane. Seriously, of all people, fucking Rudiger. It wasnt an accident."
Wasn't that the cl final in 2021 how would that have had an effect in the wc the year after
Being a thug isn’t exclusive to any one race
"Dear lord that's just American nonsense, no matter what color a guy is if I see someone throw stuff like he did and behave like he did I'm calling the police"
He lacks the warmth and depth of a cunt
"You act that way you deserve to be called one. Be it white, black, Asian, Arab and so on"
Bans carry over to league iirc
"(That's what happened in the turkish cup when Mou squeezed Buruk's nose after losing the semi-final. Got a 3 game ban but only to be served next year in the cup, provided he's still employed by then of course.)"
He threw the ice respectfully!
The perfect crime!
Can’t believe the ref would bully him so much tbh.
"His poor son will get bullied at school now no matter how much he tried to throw this match, and this is truly sad...."
And point deduction for Everton
"Sounds like a great system actually, would be funny to see it in professional football too"
"In my school district in the US, a red card meant you had to have a meeting with the athletic directer of the district and risked suspension from school and ever playing again that season  - ditto with multiple yellow cards.  So refs rarely gave them out, zero understanding on how yellow cards are supposed to operate. 

Compared to a star player on one of the American Football players who was arrested for possession of an illicit green herb and was allowed to play without missing a game."
"Lmao kinda has the ""Call this number"" vibe that you get from ATC when you fuck up as a pilot"
I played in non competitive leagues and every year there is always a team with a guy like this and they ban them for the year for something this stupid. However they will be back next year to do it again. Waste of 125 bucks.
That's why they got to where they are.
The downside of the power of friendship
Now whats the reason for the media and admin team around them?
"Salgado would stab your grandmother and whine about how dirty his knife was, but other than Salgado, It had a lot of chill personalities."
Naturally. That team had San Iker and Roberto Carlos.
Yeah Madrid seems like an extremely toxic environment to be in
My papa Perez will hear about this
god damn what did they do lol
Vasquez also got sent off for entering the pitch
People struggle to keep those two things separate. The abuse he receives is vile and I feel for him. He is also an utter cunt.
Yeah let’s not downplay racism cos the guy receiving it is a fanny.
"lol. He’s only human, right? /s"
"Nah I mean he’s done a lot of weird and physically malicious stuff.

If you had to guess from a random lineup of 11 people who’s a murderer and you know for a fact one of them physically/verbally abused a ball boy and teammates who are you guessing?"
"nah rudiger definitely has some mental issues, guy is seriously not right in the head"
He’ll be sobbing about the rampant racism within a month
5 second penalty for Ocon
"Lol years of daily karma farming, dedication."
least kinky German
Some eben make them thrice
Injuring our most important player on the pitch
It was the EUROs.
People will just say anything I guess
"Don't be obtuse. It very clearly, and famously, used by people to describe black men negatively without being overtly racist. Almost exclusively without evidence of violent or aggressive or illegal behavior. Often due to clothing or the way they speak, or the music they listen to."
"No it's not, but people of other races rarely get called thugs"
Exception will be made this time
The rules don’t apply to Madrid
"... Also what happened with Mou when he stuck his finger in Tito's eye in the Super Cup. Except the ban was then removed ahead of the following Super Cup. 

Spanish football."
"The ref needed to cool down, he did him a favor!"
"I get yellow cards in Sunday league for talking shit more than anything else.


I apologize to the ref in the moment and after the game, but I'd genuinely enjoy being forced to call the ref again on a Tuesday just to tell him I'm sorry for being a reactive moron."
"> In my school district in the US, a red card meant you had to have a meeting with the athletic directer of the district and risked suspension from school and ever playing again that season  - ditto with multiple yellow cards.  So refs rarely gave them out, zero understanding on how yellow cards are supposed to operate. 

Sports administration at the youth level is such a joke sometimes in North America for this sport.

I remember 10 years ago when I coached 5th grade boys we weren't allowed to keep score. Didn't really stop any of the kids, parents, coaches.

When I played in highschool a few years before that if you got a yellow card, you had to get subbed off for a play. For 17-19 year old boys."
Iirc in the Netherlands at least during the 70s/80s players had to go to the HQ of the FA in person to a hearing if they got a red. Not sure if that is still the case.
The real friends were the manners we picked up on the way
"Hopp is hated by Bundesliga fans because he kinda circumvents the 50+1 rule with Hoffenheim

I don't know why Werner is hated by German fans other than giving off cunty vibes but it's catchy to chant it lol"
"He does receive racist abuse, but also claims that he didn't win the ballon d'or because he's black. So basically, what you said."
"A ""most likely to be a murderer 11"" isn't exactly dispelling the notion of ridiculous drama but, regardless, Rudi wouldn't make mine. 

Anyways, here's mine ...

  
GK - Jens Lehman

RB - Sergio Ramos

CB - Jaap Staam

CB - Vinnie Jones

LB - Ben Thatcher

CM - Nigel DeJong

CM - N'Golo Kante (yeah, don't trust that smile)

CM - Zinedine Zidane

LW - Arda Turan

CF - Maradonna

RW - Quincy Promes

Manager: Antonio ""I prefer to kill him"" Conte"
"Don't mix these. Vini may be a little cunt but he's definitely been the victim of racist abuse.

I still don't like him but he's not making the racist part of this up"
100 points to gryffindor
Enter Luis Suarez
RM players have a history of that in big games.
I think this is definitely true for America but in English sports and over here in general the word doesn’t have that kind of baggage
"That's only in America. Historically the word referred to Indians but in modern English, used in England, it usually refers to lower class white people. Just go to any tabloid website and search thug."
Dosent change rudiger is defo a thug
They don't? I didn't know the racial connotations. What's the relation? Teach me some English please.
50+1 rule i get that one i guess Klopp is dead for you guys now?
">I don't know why Werner is hated by German fans

I think it's because of his [dive](https://youtu.be/FSAOzXnQMdI)"
I always thought because of his RB Leipzig stint.
"Honestly, I'd put Pepe over Ramos. He just was more Sinister. Totti over Zidane. Suarez needs to be there. Not sure I'd have Lehmann over Kahn, how could you miss Barton, he's properly unhinged. Andoni Goiko, honorable mention. Wasn't there also that Liverpool keeper that might have been a legit killer, served in the army and all."
Conte can’t even be debated that man has killed.
"I am acknowledging that, and I am saying as soon as he encounters it he will regret his decision"
He's probably talking about the Madrid fans who racially abuse Barcelona players.
Deducted from Everton's
PENAL PARA MESSI!
How Messi is still alive is beyond me tbh
We were called whiners and delusional for calling out Ramos when he intentionally injured Salah
"I appreciate his time here, but him going to Red Bull 1000% leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Not gonna speak for local/other fans but I think it's similar"
That MFer was too quick
"I’m Liverpool so I’m obligated to love him but, I too, don’t like the franchisation of football, so seeing him leap at the job of Red Bull director was pretty disappointing. Buying a football club and then plastering your brand all over it is an affront to everything football stands for, and I would’ve liked to think he was in favour of that view. That said I see why he’s done it from a personal view. Almost removed from managerial duties, decreased workload, get to travel the world etc. like it was a bit of a no brainer, like I’m sure his Mrs would’ve been kicking him if he didn’t take the job"
"**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**

"Other than losing tchou on the corner, a rather perfect game from him."
Brahim saw the ball coming to him and just casually walked away
"Kounde is so clutch man. He's literally adapted from being the best defender in La Liga, to an amazing crosser, and even a long shot maker, depending on what the team needs on each minute of the match.

On top of that, he's missed virtually no matches (except for the ones Flick benched him cause he arrived late). The best signing we've made in the post Messi era.

I love and respect him so much."
Counter terrorist wins
Best player in the game
What does RMTV have to say about this
new york training arc paid off
The “hold my beer” of goals right here
Brahim was so fucking lazy here. Fresh replacement for Vini and didn't even challenge Kounde. Not to mention all the other poor decisions he made today
"Flick doesn't lose finals, does he?"
What a player!! Best RB and he's not even his natural position
"He could play another hour, was by far the best player in extra time. Insane"
Best RB in the world since the World Cup
We deserved this.
Signature assist from Modric
Flick could pull off the treble.
So fucking satisfying
"jules, you beautiful man, you"
We absolutely deserved it! Love you Jules
Absolute banger by Koundé.
JUSTICE FUCKING JUSTICE and to top it all of a comeback 
Low Driven Plus
Best rightback in the world
"Kounde didn't want to miss another penalty in the shootout, so took matters into his own hand."
Who would've thought? not me
This goal by Kounde (RB!!) really shows how absurdly high pressing of the Flick’s Barcelona is.
Our fucking RB.
"He did really say F it, imma do it myself"
My man got rested for one match and came back a monster.
Thank you Jules you actually defeated the devil today
Who you got in the clutch: Kounde or MJ?
I swear if he went to chelsea that transfer window
Bro wanted to finish the game early so that he could go on his off match/training run.
Kinda reminds of that Messi goal when we opened the league up
Living up to the number on his back!
What a beautiful finish
That poor guy just out there running in the rain
Brahim fucked up
That’s what a fullback finisher does. And Kounde is really good.
Kounde is so good. Even off the pitch he's got great things to say. Wish he was the national team captain
Daisy cutter. Lovely.
"This cat never scores these, his last one I recall was against... guess who.


He chose today to do this, Pedri too lmao"
"1. Brahim is sleeping
2. Perfect placement (I’m getting flashbacks of Rice)

Unlucky, gg Barca"
Absolute cinema!
This bitch done hurt me
Can’t believe 2 mistakes killed us 🤦🏽‍♂️ shoulda won in 90
Best right-back in the world !
🖕🙂🖕 Puta Madrid. Fucking cheats
"Ball looked slow on stream, I can't believe it beat Courtois"
"Jules Kounde, Barcelona's Valverde!"
This loss is on Brahim
We can always trust Modric with the assist.
Fucking disgusting from madrid 2 pens the one to cubarsi and another to ferran all the fucking match with horrible challenges and the ref allowing it fuck them
"People are rightfully blaming Kounde but that pass from Modric was also awful

Edit: fuck meant brahim"
What a smash and grab hit! I love Kounde so much!!
"Fuck it, I'm Kounde"
"Look at the poor guy, just placing it bottom corner. Poor guy."
great goal.
SherineFCB doing cartwheels in her living room as we speak (iykyk)
hi my name is brahim diaz and i do not run to the ball when it's passed to me.
Half effort from RM defenders.
Not alternate. At all
Kounde motm
"Diaz and Courtois have been near perfect in their roles when they’ve played, mistakes were bound to happen, and they’re easily forgiven because of their commitment and high quality level (And to be clear, Courtois couldn’t have done much better here, I’m talking about the second goal). 

But what a terrible time for them to happen…"
"That lazy Acensio defending is something I see on Wednesday evenings playing with 40+aged men with two kids and a beer belly coming to play a ""fun"" game with friends."
Brahim Diaz and Endrick are so bad istg. Why do they get playtime is baffling to me. Not Real Madrid material whatsoever.
For football
Very happy to see barcelona returning to good ways.
"Jude was not quick enough to get back in position, first the goal that Pedri made and now this, he is really struggling in his new position and needs to changed back to the position he played last year."
This is what I keep saying! I feel like he did everything right
"He is having quite an insane season
Glad his goal highlighted that"
"to be fair, Tchouameni is bigger (and probably stronger)"
"He was in attack mode, did not anticipate a bare chested Kounde marauding through the lines dragging his big balls along with him"
He was absolutely awful from the point he got in.
"If you see where Kounde started running from, it's genuinely such a long distance that I think Brahim probably didn't expect Kounde to even attempt to close the distance. That's probably why he let the ball come to him."
Brahim felt like what your fifa/fc defender does when the game is scripted against you
The minute his Chelsea move dissolved into a Barca move I knew he was going to make our lives miserable. He was so good at Sevilla
Funnily enough i knew he was bound to do this someday when we signed him after he dribbled half our defense and scored a goal when we played Sevilla that one time
Kounde is a person of value *I* admire and respect
Thanks to alba
He was a very underrated part of today's game. Kept the attack of RM in check in the first.
he is absolutely vital to this team and he has it in him to become a legend if he stays healthy.
Funny cuz Arteta is from La Masía
Site retaken by the CT
I was seeing a lot of play acting and terrorism from both teams tbh
“The ref uses telekinesis to stop Diaz from reaching the pass!”
Should have been a penalty to Real Madrid.
The refs gave too many offsides on them otherwise they would have scored and won.
"It’s not laziness, he was thinking of attacking, he didn’t expect Kounde started a run from that far off to intercept, Kounde threw an all or nothing gamble in, that could have backfired disastrously for Barca if Kounde didn’t get the ball, the pitch was totally exposed there.

It was even a risk to shoot as the ball could easily deflect back into Brahim’s open path.

Against all odds, Kounde decided to pull this off on this night."
"late, but anulo mufa"
it's def his natural position at this point
It his his natural now. He even plays RB at france and has massively improved offensively.
Timber is worth mentioning in that conversation as well
I wouldn’t say better than Carva but that may be my bias so idk
Most importantly Real deserved it.
"His pass was honestly fine, Brahim just stood there like an idiot waiting for it to come to him."
not really his fault tbf
"I feel bad for Modric, cause all the RMA fans will turn on him and will probably exit with a whimper."
It's on everyone
i didn't see mbappe after the goal
And Modrich
blaming kounde? 🐸
It was Brahim’s fault more than anything
"That pass was fine, it’s the dumbass Brahim that backs off from the ball"
Hes done for so long
"He's the modern Gary Neville. Consistent as fuck. Rarely gets caught out. Always available. Not flashy but way more technically sound than old school fullbacks. 

We are lucky AF to have him on the team"
Maybe bigger but kounde is a tank in strength....also if you see that corner kounde was marking Bellingham and tchou completely got missed behind him.
"Fuck it, I'm Kounde"
"So graphic, so accurate"
"He is good as a sub, but he is not a first squad player. Ancelotti’s squad pick is in many ways wrong. He should have put Guller in the first squad from the start of the season. Lucas Vazquez should never have played. He’s not even good as a sub. Put Valverde as RB as soon as Carvajal got injured. Lastly, Endrick should have been given more chances the whole season, not first squad, but many more minutes in exchange for Rodrigo."
When is he not.
Couldn’t agree more. He was awful. He was even off when mbappe won a legit pk
"The fact we got Dani Alves and Rakitic from there and you were able to get Sergio Ramos (and all three of them served their respective clubs for almost a decade or plus). Sadly, they're having a downfall of a period"
"Exactly, that goal is what made me a fan of him. "
one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter (real madrid hatewatchers)
Tetenyahu wasnt the terrorist in their tie tbf
Mourinho also earned his coaching badges in Barca during his time with Sir Bobby Robson and Van Gaal
More respect for Al-Teta the goat
"OK, Barca dived a lot - but for the love of Henry you can't both sides this.."
"""He should have disallowed all of Barca goals cause' they weren't wearing white"""
Well better start bullying the ref's kid then
And to control Rüdiger to throw a missile at him to garner sympathy
Barca would've been lost in the penalty shootout. They even subbed Ferran so they wanted this to finish in ET at any cost.
What are you talking about? It's not 7 out of 7 finals.
He’s the best RB in the world for me tbh. Defensively always great and now the offensive part is there. He plays every game every minute. Best ability is availability
Timber also phenomenal. Hakimi and TAA the best in attack but Kounde and Timber shut their side of the field completely down and it’s incredible
"You could switch to saying best since Euros for Kounde, Carvajal and him both incredible"
Carva was invisible today
Gg. See you again on the 11th of May.
Never thought I’d see the day when Barca and PSG fans would be in the same camp 😅
Just stood there? He moved away from it 😭
That’s a risky pass. Brahim could’ve done better. Both things can be true.
"He holds half the fault, that was a really risky pass. "
He kinda Viera'd it.
Was brahim’s fault
Nah Its a risky pass but It’s not his fault Brahim is an idiot and decided he wants to just stare at the ball.
"No sane RM fan will.

However, all the plastics from south east asia will harass him big time"
Brahim at fault 100%
"Real career starting how it ends, with the fans not giving him any respect"
"> all the RMA fans will turn on him

club legacy"
No one would. It was more Brahim's mistake
Jesus I’m tired I mean Brahim lmao
And dude has lungs
The only bad game he had I loved was in doha. 
It looked like he was marking Tchou but he ran into Bellingham because of the angle of his run to me
"I know this season hasn't worked out well for you guys but man, you are so lucky to have a player like Valverde. Dude is always there, always running, and will play absolutely anywhere the manager asks him to. He's my favorite Madrid player at the moment."
"I’ll never understand why Guler never starts, Modric is great but he is slowing down, and Guler has performed at least solid every time I have seen him play, and he is a beast internationally."
I feel like Lamine would have rinsed Mendy more. Mendy got some great brainfarts in him.
Nah he’s shit as a sub nowadays too
"Both legs in the Champions League against us (unfortunately).

Scored the winner in the first leg and made Real's attack (that looked relatively harmless for the names it has IMO) more dangerous when he came on in the second."
"It’s because they sold their best player ever, Bryan Gil"
Casually forgetting Keita and Adriano SMH 
"Hello everyone,

Discussions surrounding Palestine and Israel, and their ongoing conflict, are both complex and prominent in our everyday lives. These issues draw attention from people with diverse backgrounds and a
wide range of views, including within our mod team.  

Unfortunately, this also attracts hate speech and brings in individuals from outside our subreddit, r/soccer. Such a complex issue evokes high emotions and inevitably leads to discussions far removed
from the subject of football. This often brings out the worst in people, including the users of r/soccer.  

Due to such brigading and external influences from outside our subreddit, as well as creating division within our community, we have been striving to maintain civility. We are trying different
approaches to manage this.  

You can help us by avoiding heated debates, keeping discussions on topic and related to football, [not breaking community rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/wiki/rules#wiki_community_rules) and
reporting comments as necessary.  

Thank you to everyone for bearing with us as we do our best to manage this challenging situation.

/s obviously"
Yeah both are world class on defense
"Ok bro he injured, bit too much lol"
I’d rather not tbh. But gotta work for at least la liga
"Barca are pressing like mad, any pass carries some risk. In the end it was a fine pass, Brahim just did not behave like he should have for being in that part of the pitch"
"What do leopards think?

e: Noo why did you edit away the typo :("
you clearly dont play ball
"Its 50/50 you cant play that one there

To elaborate: brahim was moving away even before the pass was played, even if he turns around his control has to be perfect because Kounde is coming full speed"
"You think the average RMA fan has the mental acuity to figure that out?


They still think Real Madrid are unfair victims of referee abuse..."
What running in the busy and rainy streets of New York does to a mf
I love Carlo but he hasn't been brave enough to step on established players. Asencio was dropped after his debut in favour or Tchouameni. Fran has been dropped a few times for Alaba (look at the Arsenal games). Rodrygo keeps starting games when he's been playing horrible for months. Guler is just another one of those players for him.
Makes sense that the bots will be the ones having Man U flairs.
Lmao I’m just seeing this. Just know that I laughed haha.
You don't play ball. You can't play a ball crossing the field that soft and brahim was literally facing away to start his run
"Ball wasnt fast enough for brahim to go back tbh, he should have come front to get it"
Man u dont move away from the ball in that situation. Amateur play by brahim
"brother you have never played ball. this pass leads to a goal is because brahim fell asleep at the wheel - every player knows to get the ball the fuck outta there when the press is high, you're gonna get clamped down on quick, and modric escapes under that pressure. perfect time to start a counter and get the danger away. but brahim fucked it"
Ngl i hate such fans who just go on without even thinking.
"**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**
  

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
"He said fuck it imma shoot

AND IT WORKED"
That’s why he goes running in random places on his days off
Another great finish. What a strike
"Yeah, someone had to score. Both teams were making so many mistakes"
Box office stuffs
He just said fine I’ll do it myself
"Best in the whole of Barsa's team by far, he comes to this after saving like 2 clear goals."
BEST RIGHT BACK IN THE WORLD
KOUNDE MY GOAT
"Im so ready for the excuses real madrid officials, players and fans find"
Absolute Cinema this game
Horrific from brahim to wait for the ball instead of go get it.
HILY FUCKING SHIT
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOO
"Brahiminho, my boy, what are you doing"
Always rated Kounde
Always rated Ozuna
being a nuetral must be so good
Brahim Diaz still waiting for the ball to come to him. He has been absolute trash.
YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS
"2-0 to 4-2 in semi Finals against the 3rd best team in Spain. 


2-1 to 3-2 against the second best team in Spain. 


Fucking stuff of legends. If you don't watch Barca this season you're losing on absolute cinema football. 


If it's not a crazy ramontada it's a 7-1 demolition with some of the best football you'll see. Hansi made them the best entertainment in Europe"
FUCKING DESERVED
Diabolical from Brahim. Absolute shit today
WHAT A GOAL HOLY SHIT
Another remontada completed
Unanimous support from the VAR and Madrid still lost lmao
Hahaha get fucked
The sheer determination and stamina required to come up the pitch as Right Back and score after having played 102 matches continuously for club and country. Absolute Machine.
Absolute mental
"Suck it, Madrid. Deserved after all that hate towards the referee. Hope they sink"
LESSSGOOOOOO
JUSTICE FUCKING JUSTICE
Whats brahim doing bro
INSANITY I JUST LOST MY MIND
Proper thundercunted goal.
Not sure I agree with the commentary that Modric pass was perfect and that it’s all on Brahim Diaz there lol.
Haha hold that RMTV
I'm glad Iñigo missed that tackle on Modric lol what a goal. Koundé deserves it. The guy is a machine.
Bruh I could have been sleeping
MOTM and it's not even close.
Waiting for a new video RMA makes on the refs after this despite being favored. Whiny club.
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING BRAHIM??
Brahim might as well go celebrate with them. Stinky sub
"No matter the team, no matter the game. There is but one truth in all of sports : ball don't lie. 

Cry me a river and maybe pull a gun on the ref during the game. You might win then."
We've been WAY TOO FUCKING sloppy in possession
Endrick came on and shit the fucking bed for them
What a fucking strike
116th has something with Barcelona.
"Again, 100% deserved"
What a strike
What a fucking goal holy god…
Juliano Belletti would be proud to watch the Barca RB score the winning goal
"AS A NEUTRAL, LETS GOOOOOO"
Nuts to pick it up and then pick that spot.
GOODNIGHT EVERYONE
"My fuckin general.


!!!"
"Great goal. The first thing they teach you as a kid is to go forward and meet the ball. Not wait for it to arrive. Kounde MOTM, solid in defense and lethal going forward."
Just like everyone predicted.
"Fine, I'll do it myself"
IMAGINE IF THAT’S THE DAGGER
Criminal from Brahim
"Wow great all around play by Kounde.

Well hit young man."
Who's the Real Madrid #21? Absolutely no urgency or spatial awareness on display
KOUNDE YOU'VE DONE MIRACLES ON ME.
They scored right when I lost my stream lmao
Must be the referee's fault
Brahim's controller disconnected lmfao
VAMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSS MHDP MHDP MHDP
Brahim diaz massive fuckup. Amateur like behavior
 Anyone who blames Modric for that has never kicked a ball
Get fucked loser club
"MY GAY ICON

GET INNNNNNN"
Modric showing off his ballon'dor assisting skills
LETSGOOOOOOOOO
BEST RB IN THE WORLD
The best Frenchman.
"POOORRRNNN, Roberto Carlos type of shit"
Best rb itw
Kounde channeled the spirit that helped him score against Barca in the past.
"Endrick and Brahim with back to back boneheaded plays

Raphinha wasted the first chance. Kounde took his"
Well that was a fucking stupid thing to do lmao
Brahim threw the game away
Madrid are so cooked 😂
"**HOLY SHIT**

**OH MY GOD** 

**WTFFFFFFF**

**KOUNDE I LOVE YOU**

**HOLY FUCKING SHIT**"
"Dude Kounde wtf, that was fuckin incredible"
"what a game, but ball doesn’t lie"
Such a stupid mistake by Brahim
Get fucked Madrid
KOUNDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE I LAV UUIUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
The deserving team won
Joules kounde with the clutch
"Kounde, I love you"
There was no gas left on that pitch. They were all running on fumes. I just wanted it to end.
Kounde best rb in the world!!! He’s been a rock this year for us ❤️
"them having Kounde and us having to play cafucas is tragedy 

nice planning rm board"
Ball don’t lie
Blame the ref for that one
"You can't wait for the ball like that, basics..."
Modric loses it with Brahim. He really did his team dirty there.
"Most of the players on both teams are huffing and puffing and then there's Kounde running into the opponents box! The dude is an engine! 

What a player, what a strike to win the trophy!!"
"Nice. Don’t care about Barcelona winning, just want Real Madrid to lose."
"Trent mate, you ain't gonna fix this lot. 

I hate Madrid, rent free, to my own demise. But I can't dream of anything I'd cream over more than RM capitulating into the same state utd are in.

However, it's great football to watch and I know Trent will shine if games are this open."
Var cant take that away🤣
Can VAR save them now ?
Another vintage assist by Modric
The most experienced player made the rookie mistake.
My floor is white
Good guys won in the end 😊😊😊
YEEAHAHAHAHAHAHA
What a match what a goal omg
What day is it? It's Kounde!

Justice will prevail
MAN OF THE MATCH
[https://i.imgur.com/e9nglU8.gif](https://i.imgur.com/e9nglU8.gif)
how dare the ref call that a goal
holy fucking fuck
HOW COULD THE REFEREE DO THIS
"He was already having an incredible defensive display
And now this goal

MOTM performance"
"good, fuk em.

lets see who has a reason to cry this time."
You love to see it
"Statement goal. Endrick was lucky just before, Modric not so much. Sloppy passes are costly."
Real get fucked
ball dont lie
"He's been in the right place for 116 minutes. Deserves that goal, what a strike."
LETS FUCKIN GOOOOO
Fucking Assist...!!!!!
that's a mega joules kounde.
Get fucked.
Real are winning nothing this season 
I mean what do you even do with that lmao
"That was a ""fuck it ill do it myself"" run to the ball. Let's go Kounde!"
The gas tank this guy has
What happened with Madrid after that 10 minute stint 😭😔
FRENCH FUCKING KING
and here I was thinking he'd fucked up by not waiting to slide in Yamal
Fuck madrid hahahaah
Both teams are fucking tired man
"What a strike, but what the hell are real doing"
Good game tho. I just wanted them to fight for it
Well that escalated quickly.
My fucking heart...
RMTV eat your heart out
"Yes, lets go"
What a fucking game
AaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Thank you Brahim for handing over the win on a silver platter
daaaaaaammmmmmnnnnnnnnnnnn
"I watched Kounde this season and thought, that guy can't never score. He had a lot of opportunities and was almost never able to score and now he does hahaha. Football!!!"
"Dude came outta nowhere to score that, beautiful"
"Modric what a pass, thanks a lot!"
"Give this man the Bayern job, iykwim"
"If you look closely, you can clearly see this is the refs fault."
So that's why he was wearing that headband
Kounde has 5years to prepare the shot.
Best right back in the world
My man is getting some TREATMENT in the Sitges bathhouses tonight
Brahim playing like elderly people do
Watch Asencio’s attempt to block it. Absolutely embarrassing defending!
Absolute cinema.
Ahahaha rudiger get fucked ya fool
I think the last time I enjoyed a Barça goal this much Koeman was still playing.
"Fuck RM, yes!!!!!!!"
"Modric was at fault there too, shit pass"
Kounde you absolute beauty!
yamal flat on the ground lmao
Brahim did not learn that you need to go toward the ball not running from it. Terrible player
Absolutely cinema
What a goal from el negrito ojos claros 🔥🔥😅 Ozuna baby hahaha
had to be him!!!!
"What a beautiful match it was enjoyed every second of it, pedri's goal was absolute cinema let'sssss goooooooo"
And they say Brahim is the next football superstar. Can’t even attack the ball on a pass..
Kompany flashbacks
"As he's winding up im definitely thinking ""don't shoot the ball you fucking idiot""

And that's why i'm on my couch."
It was so much than just the shot itself though. He made a goal out of nothing by intercepting that ball.
i know i am spending too much time on this sub when i got the reference
Lmaoo in new york
He is just running in the rain...
El Clasico always delivers
Instant classic. What a game. What a strike
"Lowkey banger, a striker's finish"
This is not an easy watch lmao. Completely dead legs all around.
Yeah a tired mess and still time for more.
I have genuinely aged 50 years from this game
"Can't blame them, they're exhausted"
The fatigue was severe.
What an assist by Modric
they were knackered
120min will do that to a team
"Hate both teams but Barcelona fucking deserve this. Spend the whole week crying about the refs, have a penalty decision rule in your favor, and then lose. The best timeline."
Cubarsi too.
Yeah he's been a fucking rock and a half on defence
i want to run with him to sitges holding hands together into the sunset
"He’s a stud, wish my Chelsea sealed the deal with him"
No wonder he s never rested
I can't wait to hear how they defend Rudiger nearly assaulting refs 🥰
I’m just looking forward to what they’ll pull out in the coming league match. Or they might get Fernandez x2
It's happening and Bellingham is leading the charge. Apparently every 50/50 decision went our way.
Looks like Negreira's back on the menu
"It’s even worse than waiting for it, he was backpedaling away from it lol bone headed decision cost him the match."
Hate to talk bad about Modric but not the smartest pass across the box given the circumstances either.
"Definitely his fault mainly, but you'd think modric wouldn't roll something slowly across that part of the pitch with all the nearby Barca shirts either"
This is literally the first thing they teach you. Do not wait for the ball to come to you.
"Not a good pass by Modric either. 2nd Barca goal was a gift, this one wasn't much better either."
he was moving away from it and then even just started backing up blindly.
Not the best pass from Modrić but Brahim decided to not even look at the ball....
Worse from modric tho
The pass is worse
Best player on the field today
Billy fucking shit
They need a nice slice of humble pie
Fully deserved and what a finish as well
Kounde as we all expected
AAAAAAAAAAAAA
"Not today Floro, not today!"
why didn't he get a red card? he's playing naked
Best player of the match
HILY INDEED
Thunderbolt outta the back
Horrible play all around from brahim honestly
"# chat shit, get banged"
He broke that streak earlier this week actually
he didn't see kounde there. Lmao. He was waaay too casual
I think Brahim was sitting still and Modric passed it as so. Then he seen open space  and tried to wait for it so he can run.
"If you pause at the point where modric releases the ball, Kounde isn't even in the frame. This is sloppy by a player who came on the 89' minute."
"You learn it as a kid, you always go towards the ball."
"He was running towards Kounde and still got caught offguard, good player scans the field multiple times during that pass and this kind of pass gives him time to decide whether he goes towards it and waits for it, booting it towards Brahim gives him no option and it arrives later giving Kounde more time to be on him and Yamal to catch up and he almost certainly loses it then. It's all on Brahim this one, you are Real Madrid player, some things are expected from you and that expectation didn't arrive from Brahim's side in this instance."
yeah when a missed tackle works in our favor😂😂😂 thats a rarity
"Look at rudiger tantrum now on the sideline. Can’t get enough when he is on the losing side and cries like a baby. Real played well in 2nd half, but off the field were complete immature idiots."
Now Barca has to defend extremely well in the last 5 min. I swear if he adds more than 2 min then the ref should retire.
Good guys prevailed
Brahim Diaz lost concentration
His longshot attempts are comical at times.....
"I thought it was pretty even, was going to go down to who got a good finish"
Come on you’re not a neutral LMFAO
"wouldn't classify ""athleti"" fans as ""neutrals"" tbh"
Brahim Diaz
"lmao, though comeon man. Thats more on brahim"
"I mean what an assist, get fucked"
Don’t shoot!  Don’t shoot!
Tbf Aguero said the same to kompany so you’ll become a world class striker
Glad he listened to me then.
I think all Portuguese thought the same about Éder on that 2016 final
Please help me understand 😭
I spend way too much time here.
It really was him? Lmao
poor guy...
Not always but today was great 👌
Dunno about that. I haven’t enjoyed an El Clásico this much in years.
Messi-esque finish
Inter s rubbing their hands
"Inter it's time to put all subs tomorrow. 

You won't win Serie A but you might have a chance against Barca."
Even Courtois looks exhausted
The defensive sharpness and rigidity in ET even with the dead legs is impressive. This defense has mastered the offside trap to an extent even fatigue can’t hinder.
How is brahim exhausted he played 25 minutes of awful football to that point
"rudiger was swinging full punches at the ref by the end lol, real bench was about to jump him"
"1 penalty decision ? Valverde, Ceballos, Rudiger you can choose and interpret which ones are 100% pens.

And if all the 4 French commentators on L’EQUIPE said that Tchaouemni’s tackle should’ve been a red, I’d believe them."
"They cancelled the raphinia penalty (which is 100% the correct decision) but also ignored 3 other calls, two of them in my opinion clear penalty. The Valverde hand touch was abyssmal. Didn't even land on that hand. 


Real deserved this so much. And they still make noise at the end like Eric Garcia didn't get slapped. Bunch of losers "
Even worse if everything the ref said just got verified by Rüdiger nearly hitting him with a thrown bottle
I hate that i have to watch it on espn. Steve mcmanaman is so biased during commentary.
"Cubarsi is a fucking cheatcode.

How can you play like a 36 year old veteran at that age?"
Just give the man his flowers
Really. What we did to have so many amazing 17-18 years boys playing like fucking legends????
Cubarsi had an incredible game
Gona run down the streets of new york after this
r/SuddenlyCommunist
He was just cooling his hand and the slippery ice accidentally slipped from his hand with great acceleration
"That wasnt nearly assault, it was"
">Fernandez x2

Did you refer to the ref here?

If so then his name is Hernandez^2"
"They lost today even with the ref bailing them out. Give them whoever, theyll still lose"
Yeah I’d say the mistake was 70% Brahmin 30% Modric
what option did modric have? if brahim didn't move backward to wait for the ball he would have got it
Agreed. Strange risk to take for such an experienced player
That ball was totally fine if Diaz had any spatial awareness and would have done anything except for running away from the ball.
"I think it’s 50/50, poor ball and poor anticipation."
"Then you don't know anything about football, he had all the space to himself, if he goes towards the ball he gets to take the first touch and still have nobody on him, for a player that plays for Real Madrid that should be a minimum. Moreover their counter attacks are always consisting of one midfielder taking and carrying the ball from the midfield, 1 winger goes wide and striker comes down to receive and go towards winger's side, this pattern has been played 1000s of times last 15 years in Real Madrid's history. Professional football can not be analyzed by counting all the scenarios that can go wrong otherwise no decision would be good enough ever."
Didn’t have a better option to be fair.
Depends on the pass made yeah but it's always annoying to pass a ball to someone and they just stand there.
It's your beloved Croat that gave the alwful pass stop defending him
Immense in all areas
He’s been SO good in 2nd half time & extra time.
By some margin. It was weird to see pedri getting tired early.
Nah but he's ACTUALLY underrated af
Best full back in the world
I'm tired watching him. Absurd stamina and quality as well.
Easy also prevented goals
"No doubt. cutting crosses off in front of the goal consistently, then going forward frequently including that fantastic strike."
Yamal tchoumemi valverde and pedri would like a word
All that running into stiges helped his cardio
He made the mistake on Tchouamenis goal tbf but other than that immense performance
Silly fucking shit
a true hily moment
Vardy to Madrid confirmed
We're having a vardy party!!!
Kounde really got the after burners to get there.
XD I thought the same thing
"Funny, The part where he won the ball actually reminded me of KDB against Aston Villa on the final day!"
Bruhhhh I can't stand that goal
"Context:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caUy0FfDF2c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caUy0FfDF2c)"
This season's Clasicos have been **CINEMA** tbh.
This season it has definitely delivered for me all three times
You didn't enjoy the 0-4 spanking from a few months back?
They are playing tomorrow and have to travel. They got unlucky with Pope's death.
"Everyone's out of juice, European competitions are battles of attrition at this point"
lol. As if we’re looking fresh
"They rubbed them really hard against Milan.

All big teams are cooked at this point of the season, it won't make much of a difference."
We are also dead lmao
Inter might be more tired
Put our players in cryosleep until wednesday laporta I beg you they need the rest after this
The same Inter who just got demolished by AC Milan 3:0? Yeah iam not convinced they are in their best shape either
Inter looked completely dead vs Milan too
"Yeah let’s see about that, loosing 0-3 against Milan and then having one day less pause will also catch up to them. Especially with their point situation they can’t chill whatsoever, they have to win against Roma"
Inter schedule is as bad as Barca playing every 3 days from the end of March till mid May
They look worse than both of these fuckers combined.
Why won't they win serie a but they have a chance against Barca? It's more likely the other way around
But they can still do both
they are first place in Serie A
ok not him lol
"Rudiger: If I speak, I'm in trouble.""

Also Rudiger: ""Let me talk!"""
I can’t believe Ceballos didn’t get a card this game either wth this guy is such a prick
Valverde maybe not. But the other two are.
Almost forgot about that Valverde handball. The commentators (and ref) just moved on so smoothly from it it  almost felt like I dreamt about it.
The fact that both of them are still a solid 6-7 years from their “prime” is a terrifying prospect. They’re literally not even done growing yet.
"Tbh there are A LOT of world class or almost world class youngsters nowadays. Everyone gets all these players in with their diet, training, tactics super young and they’re basically 24 year olds by the time they hit 18 with a teenager’s body. Some of the guys who grow up a bit earlier are basically 24 year olds with a 21 year old’s body"
Gonna celebrate by running to Sitgis 
crossinh the atlantic while swimming
Yep. Wasn't absolving Brahmin. He's got to go to the ball. He was also one of the freshest players on the pitch.
"Much more on Modric imo, tired, tired pass."
"It never was a totally fine pass. I mean, just stating that Brahim needed to have more spatial awareness indicates how much of a risk this was, from Modric. This was a high risk, low rewards kind of pass."
"Simeone was right about Diaz, he is not rated. He is Milan level and can count himself fortunate to have so many minutes this season for Real Madrid due to poor recruitment and injury issues."
Weird comment
Sure ig but u don’t just fucking stand there and wait for the ball to come like its an under 6’s league.
Most well Kounded player in the world
I mean it had to happen at some point
Yea he was getting sloppy in the second half giving away some balls including the one that led to the free kick Mbappe scored.
No he's not. Anyone that watched Barca knows he's the best RB in the world and he's a CB
Flick resting him against Mallorca earlier this week mightve ended up being why we won this game. Because Kounde still had the energy to do this in the 115th minute
Fuck it we'll take him might do a job here
Vardy trolling Barca fans would be something to see.
Funnily enough I don't even mind that one anymore. It was a great way for the club legend to sign off and we got ours next season. Also helps that Kompany is a class act all around
Muchas gracias.
easy for you to say lol
"After all the chaos tonight, I have a strong feeling the 4th Clasico is gonna pop off even more."
"I'm sure it must have been good for neutrals for pure shock value, we hadn't dominated Madrid like that in a long time"
People saying that haven’t watched a single El Clásico this season
Any loophole to take a Serie A game to extra time?
In a must win game too
All planned
match delayed because pope's death?
"Also, Thuram injured, no? Massive loss for the counter - attacking strategy"
This time around Inter got hit with the volcano luck.
"Sounds like the reverse 2010 volcano in Iceland, minus the difference that they don't have to travel by bus."
It really feels like they are burning the players out really badly as time goes on
"It always been a battle of attrition.


I remember the one time United pull out of FA Cup to compete in the CWC. In late 90s to early 2000s a really succesful club can reach around 70 games a season due to having two different group stages in the UCL."
At least you didn't play 120min a few days before. Makes the tie a bit more balanced
"Arsenal and PSG are both fresh tbh. We are in full rotation/recovery mode to prepare for CL fixtures with the league out of reach, while PSG won Ligue 1 two weeks ago."
How’s PSG looking atm?
"Yeah the Valverde one wasn’t a pen we’ve seen previous incidents of that already being ruled in favor of no pen. But the other two, VAR was trying so hard to not get on Real Madrid’s bad side and intervene with the game from fear of backlash and left the ref to do everything by himself. It’s unbelievable"
I truly dont understand why youre downvoted you cannot slide tackle while pulling your arms his arms were in a natural position.
"I seriously pity the ref who had to go through this. He went up to shake hands after the game ended and he looked like he was about to cry.


People should talk a lot more about what Madrid did yesterday. I'm a Barca fan so I never liked them but they had my respect until yesterday. "
"i am actually going there this thursday, hopefully i’ll bump into him"
"You can see in the replay how Kounde is soooo far away when the pass is made, and Brahim just doesn’t go towards the ball. I’m inclined to say it’s Brahim’s fault, he goes to the ball and this never happens. Schoolyard stuff."
"How is it much more on him lol. Yes pass should have been a bit stronger, but Brahim should go towards the ball not slowly go away from it after seeing pass being a bit slow.

Also it would be more understandable if Brahim was tired and it was his 120th minute, but no he only got in in 89th minute, he should run like crazy not be passive like that."
"What? The guy who got the ball started from 20m away, the guy who should've got the ball was 2m away. And you say it's the fault of the guy that passed? Utterly insane. These are top, top level pro footballers, the pass in no way was at fault, if it is then you must think that both teams commit 50 errors a game smh"
Disagree. Shortly after the ball leave his foot you can pause the video and see how massively closer to the ball Brahim is than Kounde - like half the distance - except Kounde bombards towards it will Brahim literally stands on the spot.
"These guys are assigning blame on anyone else trying to protect Modric lol. 

This is like 90% on Modric hitting a shitty under-hit suicidal square pass on the edge of his own box."
"His evolution since joining us has been kind of crazy


First he was a CB being played out of position because we lacked a natural RB, then he turned into a solid defensive fullback, and now he's developed attacking ability and has filled the almost decade long hole we had at RB"
"I would say it's the same for neutrals too. Maybe except Man Utd fans, they seem to root for Madrid."
"tbf for this game, even if we lost I'd say it was cinema. Wouldn't be happy with the result though."
Think itll be a win for Madrid tbh. Weve just played 120 mins and well have to play 3 games before the Clasico whereas Madrid only plays 1. Were gonna be incredibly tired going into that game
"30 minute injury time, here we go."
they ban football games for 3 days….inter should have played on saturday now they ll play on sunday
"Yep, I was tired looking at the tired legs and faces of the players. Valverde was almost out of breath."
"I mean fair, but today's matches are a lot more intense and there's a lot more running and pressing. Although medicine and conditioning have progressed significantly since then too. However, I really feel like it wasn't this bad in the late 2000s and the 2010s."
That was my previous question… is 120 but 3 days rest worse or 90 with 2 days of rest?
They have to play tomorrow because of the pope’s funeral then have to travel to Barcelona so they have one less day of rest plus travel.
Good thing you two are playing against each other and we'll only play either of you in the final so we'll have some rest by then. Inter is almost just as gassed.
I mean we have huge injury/suspension issues regardless. Havertz/Partey/Gabriel is the spine of the team. But at least the team is rested and  that is huge.
PSG got the biggest advantage. Whereas we’re still in a tight title race
Psg don't look very fresh. The team has not been playing like it recently either. And neither have you guys
yeah but they play each other. It won’t be a big advantage before the final because either Barça or Inter would have a week off after their final league game
I distinctly remember an identical situation involving Pique a few years back (probably against Real too) and it was given as a pen.
"if they still had your respect, you haven’t been paying attention"
Just start running and he will suddenly appear and zoom past you
Passing across the top of the box is just as much school yard stuff as not going to the pass.
A square ball in front of your box between opponents as you're being pressed is the definition of a high risk pass.
"To play a weak pass across the box in that situation is suicide. It’s not just the weight of the pass, it was just a brain dead decision in the first place. Brahim obviously should have come for it, but that would be cleaning up Modric’s mess."
But barca will have almost 5 days rest after 2nd leg inter game to league el clasico. And it will be at home too
"Flick has developed a taste for beating Madrid


He will not allow the team to switch off"
"> Valverde was almost out of breath.

This can't be true. Surely?"
and Yamal just right there chilling
fake news . the boy was defeening in 115. jfc what a player
Probably same same.
"That was my previous question… is 120 but 3 days rest worse or 90 with 2 days of rest?

Edit: for anyone curious, here’s what our infatigueable AI overlords opinion:

Really sharp question — and actually super practical for understanding real player performance and risk.

Answer:
→ 120 minutes with 3 days rest is worse.

Here’s why, broken down carefully:

⸻

Physiological side:

Scenario	120 min + 3 days rest	90 min + 2 days rest
Load on body	Extreme: glycogen depletion, microtears, muscle soreness, dehydration risk	High but normal for top players
Recovery needed	More than 72 hours ideally	48–72 hours is manageable if handled smartly
Inflammation	Higher, peaks 48–72h after heavy load	Moderate
Injury risk after	Very high if full recovery isn’t achieved	High but more manageable

120 minutes isn’t just “30 min more” — it’s often 40–50% more physical load because extra time is frantic, tense, and sloppy, meaning a lot of high-intensity sprints, decelerations, and explosive movements when players are already fatigued.
It causes compounding fatigue — not linear.

⸻

Psychological side:
	•	Mental drain from 120 minutes (especially if it was a tight or emotionally draining match) is bigger.
	•	Harder to “up” again mentally in just 3 days for something like a Champions League tie.
	•	90 minutes with only 2 days off feels rushed, but your mind and body aren’t as brutally drained.

⸻

Real-world examples:
	•	When teams play extra time in a domestic cup before a Champions League match, coaches often heavily rotate or their key players underperform if forced to play again too soon.
	•	Klopp, Guardiola, and Ancelotti always talk about how extra time kills the squad more than a “short rest” does.

(Examples: Liverpool 2022 FA Cup Final went 120’ + pens → 3 days later almost flat in the Premier League vs Southampton.)

⸻

Practical Recovery Windows:
	•	After 90 minutes:
	•	48 hours = heavy fatigue but recoverable
	•	72 hours = close to full recovery
	•	After 120 minutes:
	•	72 hours = still not fully recovered for maximum sprint effort
	•	Often need 4–5 days for true peak physical return

⸻

Final judgment:
	•	120 minutes + 3 days rest is worse than 90 minutes + 2 days.
	•	Especially right before a Champions League tie where explosive effort, speed of mind, and sprint duels are everything.

⸻

Would you also like me to sketch how a manager might practically manage this situation? (e.g., training adjustments, how to save legs before the UCL match?)
Could be interesting if you’re thinking about it from a tactical or preparation lens.
Want me to?"
120 really takes the life out of you
Yeah if we played against those two it’s gonna be a long semifinals for us. PSG can outplay us if we’re lacking energy and can’t press in time and Arsenal will just sit deep waiting for us to use up all the meager energy we have in the first place just to hit us on the counter. Shit’s brutal
"I think they’ve changed the regulation on that specifically about players going down on the ground using their hands as support being in a natural position, so it may have been a pen back then but I don’t think it is now"
I hate them as much as the next Barca fan but I still held them in high regard when it came to football. Now even that is gone. Disgusting club and management. So happy that they lost and in such a sad way for them. Also after having 3 penalties for Barca that weren't given. 
"True, but teams like Madrid make those kinds of passes all the time, with high pressing and playing from the back so common now. I think it’s just the visual of Kounde running to intercept from *so* far away, Brahim being so much closer, and *still* getting beat to the ball just makes it look worse."
"To a wide open player it's not, Brahim had like 3 business days to check his shoulder, see that Kounde is coming from 30 yards out towards the ball and just take a single step towards the pass and he'd have easily shielded or flicked the ball past him. Step towards the ball when under pressure is a basic ducking concept that he's supposed to have drilled in since school age."
"I mean yeah but that doesn't mean to never do it. Its only risky because usually in that scenario there is no space/getting closed down quickly. Brahim should know this and not 1, wait for the ball and 2, keep the ball for a long time, you wanna get it the fuck up outta there. Here there was plenty of space its not that risky - even with a ball thats kind of slow. brahim fucked it up, he was caught sleeping (even if for just half a second, thats long enough to get punished for it)."
"Brother, it's not level football. If you're criticising this you're criticising 40 passes a game. Get real. It's not the school yard"
"Risky passes happen, he was getting pressed by 2 players and saw some open space towards brahim, not too much choices at that point if you want to continue the attack, and of course in hindsight it would've been better if he just shot it as far away as opposed to this.

 Pass was definitely a bit weak, but IMO it's much more understandable than Brahim who came in 89th minute just watching the ball, then looking to the right and actually going away from the ball that is clearly not going fast enough towards him.

If teammate is getting pressed usually you run towards him also and make yourself open right?"
"If Brahim stood there he'd have gotten the pass, but he moved away.  Though he's not a midfielder so his reflex might be to run in same direction as pass so he can accelerate away."
"I mean perfect passes will not always happen. If the pass was just a bit stronger and would've come to Brahim acting as a cone there would be no discussion on it even during the match.

Sometimes you have to correct teammate mistakes and Brahim's was just a big blunder IMO. I mean look where he is at the start of the pass and where Kounde is who has been playing for 115 minutes at that point.

Not only is he not moving towards the ball he actually took few steps from it."
I hope it's not true
He was pressing and tracking back a lot this match.
He is doing what Messi started doing after 30. Chilling and then playing insane through balls
sure chat gpt
They will also celebrate 🎆🥂
This donest include that inter has to travel away for the game
Yeah same. They were rivals but there had been a grudging respect. Now that little respect is gone. Scums
Flick already made clear there's no celebrations if they win this.

Rudiger has absolutely lost it
"Damn he finally got the red. He is still shouting at the reff, that guy is genuinely not right in the head."
"Guy was ready to throw a pack of ice at the ref, should be a lengthy suspension. "
What the fuck is he trying to do? Assaulting the ref? Fuck this guy
"Whats he gonna do, beat the ref up? Tf."
Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy
Fucking embarrassing.
Has to be a long ban
"Such a strange grown man, complete and utter wanker"
What a clown LMAO
Generational head loss
Fuck this cunt
LMAOOO WHAT A BITCH
couldn't happen to a worse fella
Pathetic player
He's looking to attack with that ice pack
GET ABSOLUTELY SHIT ON
My man is ANGRY
What a clown
these RM post match interviews are about to be insufferably unhinged.
Mentality midgets
What a clown
32 year old man
fuck off cunt
He is such a twat
"He is a clown, simple as that"
What a bunch of cunts this RM team are
Jesus fucking embarrassing.
"The most embarrassing club on earth. Every time they lose they act the same way, pathetic."
"let me guess, nothing will happen to him"
this is so fucking pathetic from the real touch line. especially vini and rudiger
Biggest cunt in football currently
"WTF is he doing man. I don't understand, he needs to get a 3-4 game ban"
"That should be a ban, he acts way out of line after that card, fucking nutjob"
"Why are they holding him back? lol it looks worse when they need 5 people to restrain him to not ""attack"" the ref. As if he doesn't know he'll never play football for the next 5 years if he touched the ref."
Rudiger is the posterchild of headers causing CTE. His brain needs be studied.
Did he throw a fucking water bottle? Jfc...
That needs to be a long ban. That’s unacceptable to be doing that.
So the ref found out Rudiger could be carded
Rudiger isn't a shithouse he is just a violent person
He’s a psycho
Real Madrid players are so embarrasing man LMAO
"Can’t throw a bottle at the ref any more without getting a red, game’s gone 😤"
"Honestly, box office kind of stuff. Don’t see this kind of thing in football anymore, rightfully so, but it brings me back to not too long ago when players were villains."
You know for a fact that there will be an official communicado reprimanding the red card. You just know it.
Ban for the rest of the season. Easily. Straight up launched an object at the ref. And fuck Real Madrid. Crazy how you can simultaneously be the biggest club and Most garbage club in the world at the same time
What an embarrassing player
what is his problem
Malding cuz the ref didn't get bought 😭
Fucking psycho.
fuck off you pathetic cry baby
Fuck Rudiger. All my homies hate Rudiger.
holy shit they are embarrassing
about 50 minutes too late
"Pathetic player, pathetic club"
ban him from the sport
"Absolutely pathetic, tiny club mentality"
Fucking psychopath
Slap a big ban for this
Pathetic. Long ban
what a fucking clown
"Would have done the ref good to show him two red cards, even three. Classless"

Bro thinks he’s 2009 Drogba
Proper thug
WHAT A WHINY CUNT
What a headcase
Throwing shit at Referee is despicable. Long long ban should be in store for this guy
Fuck this utter cunt. Cancer on the game
"I'm so fucking happy that this ugliest club ever are losing their mind. Fuck them fuck everything about them, youth won"
this has to be a 1 year ban
Dude's always been a racist useless cunt.
Absolute joke of a club facilitating their players to act like this. Embarrassing
"Ban the whole fkn team at this point, disgusting attitude that runs in their blood"
"""Goodness knows what sort of a ban he's going to get for that""

... if Mbappe was any example, one game, probably in the first round of next year's CdR against some fourth division side with a combined market value of half a Modric"
This guy is such an ars*hole. He needs suspending for a long time. Very unsportsmanlike and dangerous behaviour if it hit the ref.
"Ban him for months please, what a fucking thug"
Bruh ready to assault hm
Ban him for 50 games
Pathetic....
Grown man btw
Complete headloss
Clown behavior
Pathetic just pathetic
Fucking man child lmaooo
He's mentally unwell
womp womp rudiger
"Biggest joke of a club, won it all and they’re all children. Embarrassing beyond words"
animal behavior
keep crying Madrid 🤣
Haha fuck off dirty tug say goodbye to la liga this season
he’s such a loser
\[Great throw\]
Dude would be a murderer without football
That was pathetic from the Madrid bench. I kinda feel bad for the referee now. No one deserves these abuses just for being bad at your job sometimes.
SUCK MY FUCKING DICK RUDIGER
There’s no way even Madrid fans like this clown
Absolutely unacceptable and he should have a long suspension
Erstmal Hurensohn schreien😂
Prob only a 2 game ban? Man legit tried to get on the pitch to get at him after. Insane
Man what the actual fuck. This is the first time since Pepe i’ve seen this bullshit as a Madrid fan. The dressing room has lost the plot.
"What was he going to do anyway? Beat up the ref on the pitch in front of the king?

RM is pathetic for trying to intimidate the refs"
Looks like a mental hospital patiënt
Madrid make it so hard to root for them these days. Whole team seem like a bunch of pricks. 
"Disgraceful behaviour to show children 

I fucking hate how pro players crowd referees…

FIFA really needs to fix this and fast"
That should be a lengthy ban. Assaulting a referee. Can't believe Vini escaped a card as well.  Maybe Carlo should stress discipline a little more.
RMTV are playing that clip in reverse as we speak
I love these type of reactions. When they only use 10% of their strength to pretend he’s wresting the person holding him back. If that person wasn’t holding Rudiger back he wouldn’t do anything anyway.
Should be banned for 15-20 games .
Can't wait to see how RM spin this into them being the victims again.
One of the most dislikeable players in world football
He will get a 10 minute ban for this
The definition of LOSER
I love watching these entitled pricks cry
There’s nothing that could happen to Rudiger physically on the pitch that he wouldn’t have earned either directly or karmically. Up to and including a career ender.  Dude is an absolute piece of shit in every way and the game will be better and safer when he goes away.
"rn players are the epitome of entitled cunts its hilarious. 

how anyone supports that club is beyond me, they must be just like the players, booing them when they 'dont play how we want them to'"
Justice. Absolute POS dirty player.
No surprises. This man has criminal vibes all over him.
victim FC strikes again
Real Madrid are the biggest crybaby bitch club in world football and a total embarrassment to the sport.
"Wait, people thought this was ambiguous? Hahaha, ffs, some people will defend anything."
Of course in their entire history Real Madrid have never ever benefited from a similar decision in a game /s
Pathetic dive from Garcia to be fair but the headloss is funny
"Yeah, that's not a foul on Mbappe but it's about time they got one against them. Rudiger showing what a cunt he is. Hard man pretending like he's gonna go fight the ref"
How fucking embarrassing. Absolute clown. Please leave my club.
"Not defending rudiger at all, he should get a ban. 


But that foul was total bullshit"
Ahahaha same iq and attitude as their fans.
Absolute Cinema
90 minutes late
"What the hell is he complaying about? What a disgusting player. I hope he gets a long, long ban

Spoiler: He won't."
[great throw]
"Yeah, because refereeing this match was tooootally against Madrid /s"
Rudiger is capable of receiving a card? Let alone being sent off? News to me
Should be a long ban but he's a Madrid player so 1 game ban.
What a cunt
"Is this what people mean when they say ""generational headloss""?"
Legitimately should be like a season ban for Rudiger if he was the one who threw something at the ref.
Rudiger is still trying to fight the ref. Pathetic team
Calling the ref a son of a whore in german. Stay classy Rüdiger.
"Real Madrid is such an unsympathetic club, holy shit"
Rudiger Vinicius and Vasquez all should be punished
The Real Madrid cycle: embarrass before the game - lose the game - embarrass after the game
Hope he gets a long ban fucking wanker
What a disgraceful clown
"That's a pathetic dive from the Barca player there but it's nice to see rudiger sent off, he gets away with too many crimes"
Most embarrassing player in the game. How he’s not had lengthy suspensions multiple times over this season is shocking.
Was a dive but holy shit man chill
What a cunt. After another game where he got away with all kinds of bullshit. Get fucked
Throwing an object at the ref is legitimately attempted assault…. Lmao he better get a long ban
Antonio Rüdiger is a thug that just happens to play football. Complete scumbag.
deserves to be locked up in cage
Absolutely embarrassing by all the Real Madrid players
Rudiger had to be off the pitch to finally get a red. Ironic
"Grassroots you can be banned for months for this sort of thing, let along this alleged ""professional"" and so-called ""role model"". What a pathetic club."
did i hear a strong hu\*\*\*sohn from Rüdiger in there ? classy
Let this man run on the pitch. Wtf is he going to do lol. Absolute clown.
Enjoy the ban mate
Absolutely shameful. No excuse for that.
Rudiger literally looks like a serial killer
Absoluter Asi. Wahnsinn.
His theatrics were more appropriate for WWE.
Only one game ban tho because he’s wearing white
I really hope he gets a hefty ban with how he's acting. Disgusting with half of RM squad
Mbappe kicked ball at the ref in that play after foul was called. Should also be looked at.
If he is not getting a longer ban than people will lose even more respect from referee
"Least unhinged Madrid personality. 

They're so used to special treatment that they can't believe they're not getting every call they want."
"Disgusting player, Karma…"
Most unhinged and batshit crazy player in football at the moment. Ban him until he can prove he won’t be a massive cunt again and again.
Just the worst group of players! Toxic
Incredible that they're still blaming the ref. How about blaming your fucking game bruh
Whining losers. What a bunch of saps
"I am no expert in lip reading, but pretty sure he shouted ""Hurensohn"""
He is not right in the head clearly
fucking physco
"Utter scum. A bully, and a loser."
Can't wait to see RM fans defend this.
Real are a massive bunch of babies
Fucking idiot
"For such a prestigious club, this Madrid has absolutely no class"
"At least he didnt touch his nose, so he wont get more than a one match ban"
the light that sparked in his eyes all of a sudden was quite scary
"What if no one going to hold him , what can he do , murder the referee? Clowns"
"Rudiger, Vini even Bellingham (Madrid have so many cry babies) lmao"
Must be the referee's fault. Oh wait
Should've let him go. This clown always acts tough when his team is holding him back. The fuck is he gonna do? Punch the ref? Let him.
"For comparison, in Ligue 1, Paulo Fonseca got a 9 months ban for yelling at the referee chest to chest without actually touching him. If RFEF has any integrity whatsoever, Rudiger should be sitting for at least as long, too."
"Man they really need to hand out lengthy bans for this, absolutely no place for it in the game. There is a definitive line between disagreeing with a ref and being outright aggressive."
Biggest inferiority complex in world football
Ancelotti just standing there shrugging.  I’d never be able to show my face again.
"Madrid really worked themselves into a shoot.

Most rattled club I’ve seen - they whipped up a controversy then lost their heads from the chaos they created."
Still to this day I can’t believe people tried to tell me he’s not a dirty player after he shoulder charged KDB in the UCL final and broke his eye socket. Absolute rat of a human with genuine psychological issues.
Fucking hell Real are just pathetic
"Trent watching this thinking ""yeah, that's the team for me""."
Can’t think why people say Real Madrid are entitled
Rudiger is such a terrible human being man
No wonder people hate those guys
[ Removed by Reddit ]
And I wonder WHY people hate Vini and Rudiger????
How soon for the comunicado Oficial falling this a bs red card?
Should be a lengthy ban. Will be like 1 match at most.
I just kept thinking what was he genuinely gonna do? Punch the ref? His ass would be arrested before he picks up his losers medal😂
"Dude was in Kill mode.  
  
  
What do you guys think he would do to the reff if Real players didn't hold him back?"
embarrassing as hell. what was he thinking? should be end of the season for him
Fiiiiiiinnally a red card for rudiger.
"They're all saying he's getting a long ban, it's Real Madrid we are lucky if he misses more than 1 game lol I will believe it when I see it. Real Madrid will just bully their way into getting what they want"
Rüdiger! nicht so tiiieeef!
3 game ban for Lewandowski
Ancelotti deserves some blame for the biggest bunch of whinging cry babies in football
"He should honestly be screened for the antisocial personality spectrum, and this is coming from a Chelsea fan who used to adore him"
1 match ban for Rüdiger incoming...
Lifetime ban. Crazy fucking idiot
3 match ban for touching the nose. Let's find how many matches they give for this hooliganism
What a bunch of fucking babies
Real Madrid is a disgrace.
Deserves a longgggf ban for that. Maybe even a seasons worth. Disgusting.
Real Madrid god complex shining again. Running onto the pitch and throwing things at officials because they didn’t like a decision. They think they’re above everything and they can do and behave how they want.
Insane foul call to be fair
Trent do you really want to leave a title winning team for this? It's not too late to have a change of heart lad
Clown behavior
Absolute fucking cunt
Madrid have been embarrassing over the past few days
This whole club deserves sanctions at this point the behavior is pathetic
Mad lad. I miss him at Chels.
"Most disgusting club on this planet, actually embarrassing the pure arrogance of them cunts. People complain about the likes of city and psg for oil money owners, but no club will ever reach the level of cunt as this club."
"Why are these clowns even mad for ? Rudiger ? Fucking Vini is getting mad throwing bottles... like brother, you did exactly JACK SHIT whole match, you should just go sit on your little bench and learn to play fucking football you petulant child."
Anything less than 6 months will be a travesty. That's literally assault.
He was about to kill
He never had it
I really enjoy the few moments of comeuppance he gets
Every time i see him play there is always one moment where he turns into utter clown.
"I don't even understand how he's doing this shit while his team is losing in the last seconds of extra time. So ridiculous, RM behaving like spoiled children."
FINALLY getting what he deserves. Such a violent player all around.
Madrid meltdown
They'll still blame the ref for losing
"He loses it for a moment every single game, but gets away with most of the time"
He finally went full crazy
"It's been a while since he's lost it, tbh.

I can't remember a time when he wasn't a Hothead and a bit of a cunt."
"I wish that they wouldn't hold him down just to see whatever the fuck he was thinking

But at the same time, he's a fucking psycho"
Wasn't expecting to hear 'Hurensohn' during the Copa del rey final lmao
I mean if there’s one player I could see in another life going to jail for hacking someone up with a machete it’s Rudiger tbh
"""HOLD ME BACK HOLD ME BACK!"" *yawn* just fucking leave Rüdiger"
He's bullying his own teammates lol
"Should be banned from the sport, together with Ramos and Pepe. Stupid old school mentality "
Like we will meme on him being mental but that's literslly attemted assult with a weapon
">should be a lengthy suspension. 

1 match ban and 10 Euro fine will be enough"
Correction - second pack of ice. He threw one already
"considering he literally threw  a bottle at him, yes"
"No, clearly the ref was wrong for standing in the way of the thrown object and should be banned from conducting matches"
I used to laugh at his antics but it has been creeping into a bad way. This has got to be the tipping point.
He wanted to touch the referee like how Messi touched Lamine Yamal
"Everything he does is so obviously forced and animated it’s painful to watch, absolute lunatic, the only time where I’m okay with using word cringe because he’s an embodiment of it."
Genuinely reckon he might have if he wasn’t held back. He is lucky he can kick a ball well or he’d be in prison in another life.
Friendly spat
There’s a reason his teammates rush to hold him back. They knew what he might do.
The Madrid kitman will pay for this
He is so hate able its insane
Disgusting player
It's always the person who you least expect
Always the least you expect smh
Hahaha for some reason these comment always make me laugh. Fuck that guy
Actual Psycho Rudiger
"He has no place on a football field. Absolutely scum of a creature, he is not right in the head."
Very embarrassing for a grown man to throw such a tantrum. Very childish.
"I dont watch La Liga often but this pathetic display I didnt expect. Rüdiger himself should be happy he wasnt sent off on the pitch, as Tchouameni. How can you act as if the ref rigged it against you after this game??? Absolute headloss."
Genuinely what the fuck is his problem? There's other players in that Real team that act like entitled children but Rudiger always seems like he's on the brink of doing something that will get him arrested.
This guy ain't right in the head. Had the audacity to throw shit at the ref that favoured them the whole match. And the sad part is that he's probably getting a slap on the wrist for this
1 match ban
Cancelled on Monday.
Most I can do is one game
"Just like that Mbappe one, right?"
Absolutely embarrassing
Complete headcase
Minimum the rest of their season surely
"He's beyond embarrassing, dirty twat"
You know he’ll only get one game
"Was using the bottle to challenge for the ball I'm afraid, 1 match"
Nah he will be suspended for one game at max
"Odd cos Vini looked like he did the same.
Just a big old tantrum."
One match it is!
If that hit the ref it could've hurt him. NEEDS to be a long ban or else is corruption
This is some of the most disgraceful shit i have ever seen. Real are a total mess
Long = 1 day
"Embarrassing display. 

Relegate real Madrid for this shit"
"Hope so honestly, had it coming"
Generational crashout
"Believe it or not, point deduction Everton is the only punishment (Rudiger plays for Madrid)"
And it would be deserved. Total idiot.
Half a Game tops
He's so clearly got some issues that have just never been addressed. A thoroughly horrible player who has got away with far more than he's deserved to.
I remember some quotes from Morata and Gimenez saying Rudiger pinches the striker's nipples to distract them.
Nah that was Blades of Glory
Genuinely one of the nastiest players in football and somehow for years it’s been played off as hilarious
Pathetic club
I worry about his wife/kids if any
"And I think it's about high time that people start talking about Carlo as well. He has been enabling this kind of behaviour for years. From Rüdiger, from Vini, from Jude, from Carvajal. Entitled, spoiled, bratty cunts that'll act out when they don't get things their way. Carlo is part of the issue, part of his responsibility is to foster a healthy culture in the dressing room. His eyebrow vibes don't change that."
Blud is trying to shiver the timbers
Average Brühdiger Moment
They got that Segundo mentality
"First time I’ll ever cheer Barça winning a trophy. They deserve it.

Fuck Madrid and their petulant bullshit, football doesn't belong to you."
"They dominate most teams during high pressure games, but the second they play against Barcelona they can't keep their shit together. Absolute cinema"
"It’s the big difference between the current Madrid side and the consistently Champions League winning Madrid sides over the past decade or so. They had so many mentally strong players who’d never give up, hence how they could get wins from dire conditions.

The current side, no matter the world class players, seem to be in a state of constant tantrum if things are going badly, and the club culture at the top seems to do the same too. Not enough headstrong players to keep them focused"
32 year old ~~man~~ child
Not even the biggest cunt in Madrid
Madrid love them type of players. Pepe now Rudiger
"Diego Costa got a 8 match ban for saying puta madre to the ref, Rudiger was literally throwing things at him and needed to be physically stopped from assaulting him."
Not enough imho. Can’t attack the fucking ref.
"That red is 3 games in itself, but he deserves like 10 games for this"
"He threw something at the ref, should be a 10 game ban atleast"
Should be close to Fonseca's ban
"He threw an object at the ref. If La Liga had balls, he'd be banned for at least 6 months."
"Should be 20, just to make an example of him"
"""Best i can do is 1 match - otherwise Real will be mad at me"" - whatever that clown-federation is called"
"Ngl this is 10-20+ game ban at least for any normal player. But it's Madrid so I would say maybe he gets 8. Anything less than that is an utter disgrace, this is much worse than Mbappe. If a fan throws any minor shit and hits a player it is a 3-0 win automatically, this idiot threw stuff at the ref."
He wouldn’t actually touch the ref if he was let go of lol. I watched him take out Ferran away from the ball and then saw Ferran drop him the next play. Guess what he did to Ferran? Absolutely nothing. He’s a wanker that acts tough stuff for show.
[don’t hold me back](https://youtu.be/e1KEC_3vygc)
MBC (Antonio Brown) of Spain
Had to be quite full to go that far
"They’re just Getafe with 12x the wage bill this year, honestly"
this sequence is just both clubs peak DNA at work lmao you couldn't script it any better
"Different times now but people in the years to come really need to watch it with too much Barca glazing otherwise you get another insufferable [UEFAlona](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/30/article-2674800-0958E0C2000005DC-775_634x333.jpg) ""More than a club"" era. This sub barely existed back then but the European streets have not forgotten."
Mate if you want all clowns to leave your club you'd barely have a squad
Mbappe hand to the face was pretty clear. Madrid won a game off Bellingham getting that exact same foul before.
"  doesn’t give u the right to charge at the ref like that,Atleast a 3 game ban"
"RM was lucky to not get one of the 3 potential penaltys against them, at least one should have been given"
He isn't right in the head competitive and psychopath  is different
honestly I was scared. His eyes were so scary
Yeah his celebration was serious during the CL
"like any ""tough"" guy when being held but in reality if not held he will get on the pitch and do fuck all but extend his suspension and that's the main reason he's held back"
was gonna say we’re talking about the same man who shoulder checked kdb’s nose while he was looking the other way. he was never all there lol
of course not. he's an actual psychopath that intentionally hurts people. yet some people in this sub will attempt to gaslight you into believing he's just a quirky lil guy with a competitive mindset.
Always been a nutter
"People shit on Vini Jr and Mbappe way too much, I actually don't dislike either of them really. But Rudiger? That guy is really really weird in a really bad way."
"Never forget r/soccer defending his cutting throat gesture towards Atleti fans with ""it's just a celebration""

The guy is an unhinged psychopath. One of few players I wouldn't feel sorry for if he broke his leg and tore both ACL's"
"Draymond green of world football.
Should be sent off every game but still cries."
"Wdym getting what he deserves, he deserves a 6 match ban at least and will get a slap on the wrist."
"He literally stepped on a kid and got nothing for it, could’ve actually really injured him. Disgusting and mediocre player"
honestly embarassed
Probably would have postured a bit more then fucked off. Would-be bullies are always cowards.
"I soo fucking wanted him to let go, just what would he do"
"Right? Referee should come closer and not running away. Stop pretending ""hold me back"" moment."
„Hurensohn“ und „Missgeburt“. Classy.
Sprich Spanisch du Hurensohn
"Maybe in this life, even."
Don't hold him back instant 6 month lol
In one of the broadcast angles I think he bit his own trainer's shoulder?!
"Rudiger is much more a Pepe than a Ramos. 

Ramos was extremely dirty but he never lost control like this. Rudiger and Pepe have a screw loose."
Think he threw ice from his leg 😭
Well done for not using an s tag
seems like he is lucky his teammates held him back right here or he would be in prioson
"He wasnt going to do shit, would have postured some more and backed off at the end of it"
"Imagine you're on a night out, you and a another guy have a disagreement, you start shoving each other. As you're about to hit the guy, suddenly your hear ""HEY"" you turn your head and it's a coked up Rudiger in a full sprint coming at you"
And somehow the hate are all deserved.
Pepe/Ramos regen
It's the badge innit
"Person*

He’s disgusting overall. Don’t believe me? Google his video assaulting a RM employee during training"
probs missing the El Classico too so really making you a favour here
"I mean their whole club has been in that atmosphere for a year now, it was bound to mark the players eventually lmao"
He threw more than just a tantrum….
This is literally every third game by Rudiger
"2 penalties not checked by VAR, two potential red cards for Madrid, and a penalty (correctly) overturned for Barça. Yet they will cry foul anyway, because of that foul at the end. It’s ridiculous but it is absolutely conscious intimidation tactics towards refs for exactly the stuff you saw in this game. VAR is too afraid to intervene most of the times unless it is for Madrid."
This sounds harsh. How about a couple of stern words?
1 dinner ban.
Penalty in favour of Real Madrid.
somehow I don't think they'll pressure the ref to say it was nothing this time
Lol. It'll be 1 game.
Vinicius made a throwing motion but I don’t think he actually THREW anything?
"Nah he didn’t throw anything, they showed the reply on ESPN"
Vini didn't launch a water bottle
Real Tantrum FC
"Nah Vini just ran out and did a motion, but rudiger threw something and then wanted to throw his ice pack too before being held"
Vini always throws a tantrum
Pretty sure it was just tape. Either way it should be many match ban
Might’ve lost you La Liga too if he gets banned for long.
No idea how more wasn’t made of the obvious stamp on MLS.
"Jokes on him, Morata loves that shit"
"I mean his antics are often hilarious, but it seems he’s been slipping further and further into dangerously violent behavior. At this point he makes peak Ramos look like an altar boy"
"I swear he wasn't nearly this bad playing for us,  just maybe an above average level of dirty at worst,  could potentially attribute that entirely to bias memory though"
"Man, I've been totally neutral in the Madrid-Barcelona rivalry for my whole life. I've really barely ever cared. The last 6 months or so has completely changed me. I'm revolutionized. Fuck Madrid. This club is obnoxious. These people are annoying. These players (except Valverde, love that dude) are absolute idiots.

Fuck Madrid. Let's go, Barca."
Seriously if he does this shit in public… 👀
he definitely beats his wife
Same. I'm not fan of barca at all but real madrid's intimidation towards the referee before the game made me want barca to win
Madrid dominate high pressure games? What? They usually win those games but they're the ones who usually get dominated especially in the CL in recent years.
"curious who youd think it is, for me its clearly Rudiger"
1 match ban. Overturned by next week
If this is not a 10 match ban its a disgrace
"\>If a fan throws any minor shit and hits a player it is a 3-0 win automatically,

Literally last week in ligue 1 a fan threw a coin at a ref.

He spent the night **behind bars.**"
"What the fuck was that he threw towards the referee? That should be a looooong ass ban, 10 games+ *at least* but since it's a Real Madrid player I guarantee he will get nothing"
Were? That’s how he always is.
He still wont be punished still sadly…
"Definitely looked like a psycopath, would not want to be near that guy when mad"
"Please. What are you scared of? A football player?    
Just digusting behavior. Should be banned at least 10 games."
You were scared? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 watching someone get mad on tv and you got scared
"Can't be a monstrous competitor without the monstrous. He's always been like this, he thinks it's part of what he offers."
[He is a pathetic bully too; think it's fine to slap people in the face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzcPY7ljnCs)
">Never forget r/soccer defending his cutting throat gesture towards Atleti fans with ""it's just a celebration""

Yes it quite literally is just a celebration lol. Whats next, you're gonna say that the sniper celebration towards fans is someone actually trying to execute them? 

His behaviour today was unacceptable. But pretending that his throat cutting celebration is something crazy is a bit much lol. He's been doing that for years."
has rudiger perfected the art of natural kicking motion to the balls? until then draymond still has the edge lmao
He's worse than draymond
"Nah, my GOAT Felipe Melo would have absolutely floored the ref."
I think he is a bit more than just bully. It actually looked like he completely lost it here.
Idk man he seems like he is genuinely insane and would do something like pushing the ref at least.
HOLD ME BACK BRO
"Thing is, if Rudiger actually decides to get physical, he’s done for as Rudiger is twice his size. I wouldn’t gamble on it"
"The referees are there to deescalate, not provoke further conflict."
Also dropped the Missgeburt? That one is actually crazy wtf.
Calling someone a son of a whore and someone with birth defects. Bruh
habla aleman hijo de puta
Definition of a meltdown.
"Could’ve killed him, straight to jail"
"To be fair no, its really him.


I remember chelsea's champions league winning run, seeing him play and thinking ""why is this man allowed on a football pitch?""


The badge just made it so he isnt punished half as much as he should, but the issue is much deeper than the badge, deep inside he is not fit."
Or how he bullied our youth players
Yeah I saw that one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzcPY7ljnCs
Royal Mail posties are just doing their job. That's disgusting
"I liked him at Chelsea, but I’m also a Chelsea fan. He has always been a crazy mfer, but I had felt that was his passion bubbling over a bit. Since he left, my opinion on him has soured because of shit like this and that video. Countless examples of him being more of a crazy a hole than anything. 

Idk if I feel that way because the blue blinders are off, because he ended up at Real, or because he’s actually just transitioned into a crazy a hole. Maybe he’s always been this way. Regardless, for me it’s disappointing to see him like this."
I fucking hope he's disgusting and a dirty player
Every third game is being generous. Dude is a total nut case
"Seriously, he's a MMA fighter who sometimes happens to play football."
And a 100 € fine
"I'm sure he was fighting for the ball, nothing malicious."
"Most definitely lmao. Throwing something from the bench at the ref SHOULD be more

Surely Vardrid won’t piss shit and cry about this all week"
A tape would not fly like that I think.
"That was grim, fair play to MLS just shaking it off though. Played with more maturity as a 17 year old than basically all of that Madrid team."
"Yeah, he surpassed Ramos, his next club goal is surpassing Pepe"
"He was at Chelsea when he destroyed De Bruynes face by blindsiding him in a CL final.

Might have gotten worse, but he's definitely done shit with Chelsea."
Valverde and Modric
To behave in this manner at the end in a match where the referee favoured them I can only imagine how things usually are 😖
Bro is finally radicalized.
"Honestly, I think this has been the exact same experience for a LOT of people, me included."
Didn’t Valverde also avoid getting banend after punching Baena after a game or am I thinking about a different player ?
"Both clubs are insufferable, but Real really is on another level..."
"these clowns should have been knocked by leipzig in the round of 16 but the ref was paid so it was only a yellow instead of red, I remember that game had more rigged moments too"
"the big man himself, FloPe"
carvajal would give him a run for his money if he wasn't injured
It should be 15+ games to be honest. Stamp that shit out of the game for good
Given it’s a Madrid player it’ll be reduced to 1 game and a 10 Euro fine
He yanked his icepack from his legs the second time he tried to go for the ref
looked like a ball of bandages
"\*looks at colour of the shirt*—""Best I can do is 1 match."""
If a Barca defender did that Madrid would start a Spanish revolution.
"He also screamed ""Missgeburt"" (miscarriage) and ""Hurensohn"" (son of a whore) to the ref in German, you could hear it very clearly on TV"
I think it was a bundle of ice. It should be a season ban at least imo
"Water bottle I think, didn't miss him by much either lol"
The ice-pack for his leg.
calm down man he did it respectfully /s
The only precedent I can think of is Arda Turan in 2015 when he threw a boot at a linesman. Believe it or not I think he just got a yellow for that
Commentary saying it was like a paper ball
"They\*

Vinicius and Vasquez were also involved"
"Did pepe even get 10 for that GBH incident? Now if they actually let rudiger get to that ref lol, would have been a spectacle let's put it that way."
"I remember I grew quite late (now I am tall, but till like 15-16 always a smaller kid) 

and I played with older guys in youth football

I used to be scared of other players way too much\^\^"
"he's been a psycho for years too. in a vacuum i'm on board with saying it's just a playful celebration, but given context, it's obvious that it's not just that."
Lewis-Skelly nods
Thanks for 2010 xoxo
Pretty normal german swearing words tbh :D
top bins by you
What happened with youth players?
Guy is a huge  piece of shit. Even with us he always  had a screw loose.  Remember him trying to two foot someone in a match  where everything was already decided and outcome didn't even matter . And he did it in several matches not once...
That would make more sense but he'd get his shit rocked by any professional fighter half his size.
Evra's found his opponent
50 € and a penalty for Real Madrid
That's fine
he was actually just trying to make sure the ref stayed hydrated. Nothing but compassion and concern for his wellbeing
"Oh absolutely *should* be a long ban.


This is Real Madrid though. It'll be one game."
But didn't you hear Jude?! Everything is going their way not ours! This isn't faaaaaaair
You mean to say the ref has to pay the 10 euros right??
"Well, if Mbappe only got a one match ban for a ridiculously dangerous challenge, Rudiger will be grand."
Also a disappointed tsking.
10 bob and a pickled egg fine.
Swinging that at someone’s head would be like swinging a wet sock full of batteries at someone’s head. The ref was lucky Rudiger was held back holy shit
"Bio weapon, 10 game ban and a trip to the Hague for crimes against humanity imo"
Looked like a golf ball the way it flew halfway across the pitch lmao
That could cause a serious head injury if it connected. Rudiger is deranged. Season long ban hopefully.
"Which was a disgrace, he should have been banned for a long time. I mean Diego Costa got 8 matches for calling the referee's mom a hoe which isn't anywhere near as bad"
that’s stepping on the balls
Yeah he stood in the way of the bottle. Could have destroyed vital equipment for Madrid.
No ref gets 10 match ban for not catching the bottle.
Ref has to refund the payments.
Yeah and he got 1 games banned!
It's not the object itself being thrown that is the problem here(unless it is something genuinely dangerous obviously) but the intent. If you let him get away with this you set a precedent that it's perfectly fine to throw objects at the ref
10 games should be a minimum.
"This reminded me of a crazy incident in a Sevilla derby about 20 years ago. Betis fans threw a bottle of frozen water from the stands and hit Sevilla's coach Juande Ramos in the head. He was knocked out cold

He genuinely could have died there it was extremely scary"
"> you set a precedent that it's perfectly fine to throw objects at the ref

We should all care about this too because these leagues don't just set precedent for themselves they set precedent for the people watching. There's a reason there is a huge dearth in referees at the grassroots level and its because coaches, players, fans, and parents think this type of behavior is okay.


When its gotten to the point that the FA needing to put body cameras on refs for grassroots games you know there's a problem."

"Love everyone with their catalan, basque, andalus, and canary islands flags"
I like how both Ter Stegen and Araujo got to take it and lift it 🥺🥺
MATS lifting two trophies without playing in any of them lol. Levels!!
Hansi Flick you have changed my life
Hopefully not the last lifting this season
"Beautiful 

Im not crying"
Most entertaining team in Europe can’t help but tune anytime I can to watch them
"I love this team so much 😭😭😭 Copa del Rey is usually Barça's, specially in recent years... But this one feels so special"
something something football has won
Full kit wanker MATS /s
11 v 12 and we still won
"At first I didnt buy it in Euros.

But I legit think right now Yamal is one of the best player in the world right now, def top 5. Dude just dont make mistake and always make the correct play."
ancelotti got the saddest farewell ive ever seen in my life
"At the end of the day they didn’t disappoint us, thank you barcaaaa"
"I am fucking pissed that we had to play an extra 30 minutes with the CL semis coming up because the referee didn't award two stonewall pens to us.

Maybe if we mobbed the referee and bitched like Vinicius and Bellingham, it would've helped.

Absolute narcisstic cunts, capped off by the psychopath and mental patient Rudiger."
Now they'll schedule their high school trip.
"Absolutely euphoric and cathartic at the same time, what a clutch performance to not only win the title but to make Real crashout like pathetic bitches"
The world is healing
I legit cried. I love them so much.
"Not a Barca fan by any stretch but so glad they beat that utterly disgusting, classless and entitled club."
The tiny trophies they have are so cute
Emotional thinking about all these kids who get to lift their first trophies with Barca this season. I hope this is just the start for them and we're witnessing the beginning of a new golden generation.
VISCA BARCAAAAA 💙❤️
4 years since we won our last one damn
Well deserved!
Let’s gooo! Visca Barca!!
Did they put ter stegan in the squad just so he could get a medal?
Can't wait too see what the next communicado and madridTV have to say about this
"I'm not a Barca fan (or any top EU clubs in general), but after seeing the Real Madrid clownery in the past few days, seeing this makes me so happy and satisfied lol. congrats!"
What's Real boycotting this time?
I fuckin love this club.
Eat it Madrid supporters
Visa Barca 💙❤️
Barca saved football today
"Football won today, and I say that totally unbiased."
Take that ye whiny cunts
Absolute beauty 
So happy for them.
Much deserved.
"Honestly happy for them, well deserved"
"I've been a casual real Madrid fan ever since I was a child. My family went on holiday there and the barman gave me a real Madrid kids shirt.

But their behaviour recently is pathetic.... Not a fan of Barcelona but seeing them win was GLORIOUS.

If real Madrid want any respect they'll deal with their man child players harshly. Disgusting behaviour."
"great moments. this Copa meant really a lot, to both teams."
Will there be a special cigar for Tek for every title he won there?
I wanna know who lifts the UCL if we win it(Anulo Mufa)
full kit wanker
"Just give it to them at this point, let's not hold the tournament next year. 32 out of 43 finals, bloody hell."
"Blud think he's part of the team

/s"
"Theatricals and dirty play won today. Such a pity! Not the first time though, we already got used to it..."
Spanish nationalism in shambles
During the king’s cup too lol
"most barcelona thing ever, not one spain flag spotted"
Ceballos spitting with fury
Guys the king is literally right there
yeah Spain clearly lost today it seems
Fuck Franco and his football team 🇮🇪
A bit odd since they didn’t start but at the end of the day if they wan their captain and vice captain to lift it I get it
Means so much that he lifted it. Araujo alone would've been weird lol
"he will win 2 more on the bench, legend"
"Tek is such an upgrade, maybe not distribution wise but shot stopping feels much safer"
"Imo that was the best contribution he could have made this season. Tek isn't perfect but there is a chance for a big game masterclass, with MATS it has been 10 fucking years since he consistently saved us in big games. He carried us in La Liga though and was a top 10 keeper, but never top 3 and that is what makes the difference in those top top games (and that is the main reason why Barca doesn't have at least 10 CLs with the players we had historically)."
"At least two lifts left 100%, maybe all three"
la liga it is. Take a well earned break after that /s
Madrid are though
"The schedule has clearly taken its toll. The speed that I saw from some players in the past was night and day compared to what I saw yesterday by the 60th minute. The playstyle will also be a factor. Overall I'm concerned that the fluidity and the speed of our attacks will keep dropping.

Example: How many dribbles did lamine attempt after Fran came on, how visible was his impact in the second half? He was class in the first half. But was hoofing crosses once the tiredness set in.

Lamines age has me very concerned about this but the others in the squad generally give me injury anxiety."
"I mean our last Copa was 4 years ago. Whole different team (think only Pedri and de Jong were there) , whole different vibes, kids from the academy, and a possible (non-messi) Ballon D'Or winner with us. Does feel different."
11 vs 13. Include the VAR also.
"this and the man united arsenal game in the fa cup???

I've said it before and I'll say it again. FOOTBALL IS TRULY BACK!!

and this still feels more legendary"
Propaganda really works huh..
"And it's the way he does it too, that pass to Ferran was filthy!!! His confidence with the ball, to move forward, to stop and make decisions at an instant... HE IS 17!! Insane, it's so cool to see a star in the making"
He had a few mistakes throughout the match where he shot it and gave up the ball but besides that great match
"Also so fucking disrespectful from the players imo.

This is the last final the most successful manager of Real Madrid history is managing and you decide to see him off by being psychotic, complaining manchildren.

The GOAT deserved better. I'm sorry you were let down, don Carlo. You'll be missed."
shit got me real happy
"You know, I sort of shrugged off the blatant favoir for Madrid since we managed to take it in the end, but you're absolutely right. This is unecessary fatigue before the semi final."
You guys better win the league as well. Complete the treble of meltdowns.
This game was incredibly !??! !
By far the most entitled fanbase that’s for sure.
"I want Flick raising that shit, brother changed my life."
Can Ter Stegen even lift it if he's not in the UCL squad?
Worry about PSG first theyre scary af
Those players didn't win the cup tonight blud
And he can suck a big one <3
"Franco literally saved Spain from the Soviet Union and from WWII, let's show some respect"
"It’s always been this way though. At least every time Barça wins a trophy I’ve seen them do it. 

Abidal lifting the UCL for example after he beat cancer."
>Alex Song disliked that
Yes certainly better than only 1 lifting it
"I don't think by a lot, he's got height advantage to do things Ter Stegen can't like inches to parry or simply collect a high ball which might be dangerous for Ter Stegen. But today we see Tek being beaten by the same sort of goals Ter stegen been eating.


Ter Stegen however has a baffling consistent weakness at near post. I assume he anticipates the harder side which gives him a chances to save far post at the same level as taller keepers, but it's a huge sacrifice for near post."
"Ter Stegen has immense reactions and covered for our lack of defense for many seasons, but Tek is more confident and competent in nearly every aspect of ""traditional"" goalkeeping. He's a good shot stopper, good in the air, doesn't have Neuer-esque adventures into no-man's land (he did for the first month, but has adapted well and rarely makes these mistakes anymore). 

While we do let in goals, they usually come from the incredibly high line combined with late season fatigue and Araujo and Martin not being adept at keep the offside trap, instead of goalkeeping mistakes (these have happened, but are rarely the deciding factor in a loss)."
Let’s calm down here
Rudiger definitely is
I‘m gonna be so mad if they run Yamal into the ground by overplaying him. We _need_ to see just how good that kid can become. He‘s an absolute freak.
14 vs 11 RMTV is also playing
"Var was there, I thought there was No Var for this game"
I can’t believe VAR was so fucking scared shitless of Madrid that they refused to get involved until they were forced to at the end. It’s ridiculous
"It's been nearly 4 months and you are still bringing that up lmao.

We had a goal disallowed for offside which deflected off a united defender. Shit happens, move on."
"You guys are disgusting, just so you know that (you already know that)"
It worked on the referee anyway. Bro was scared for his life and Rudiger still had to throw those tantrums..
Right? Propaganda like RMTV mass broadcasting one-sided narratives as if Spain was still under the Franco regime.
"No, i just have working eyes and a functional brain"
The rmtv? Apparently yeah
Have some shame.
That's rich.
No having 2/10 eyesight should do the job.
"Well, yeah, RMTV propaganda"
"I think we have long passed the ""making"" phase."
If you are mention the last 30 minutes he simply didnt hve the legs for more
"this is what happens when u hire more ramos type thugs in ur club, go employ some player with brains"
One of the greatest managers of all time
"Genuinely curious, who do u guys rate more between ancelotti and zidane. They seem pretty even on top of my head."
"You guys played well though?

It's been a bad season but the only player who was meh today for you was brahim"
Legendary manager. Hoping the eyebrow memes last decades.
i pushed myself into staying awake till midnight so i can make sure that my favourite la liga club barca wins it.
The popes death balanced it out though. Inter play tomorrow
"Nah, fascists don't get respect."
Fuck off facist.
Spurs flair commenting this is wild
"*""We have saved Europe from Fascism but they will never forgive us for it""* - this quote rings true every single day."
"It has always been like this. Even in the first UCL we won, Jose Mari Bakero was the captain on the night but the club captain Jose Ramon Alexanko lifted the trophy even though he was on the bench the whole game."
It's just a shame that Barca legend Alex Song was robbed of his moment with the league trophy.
Abidal wasn’t even the captain
**La mufa no pasó de mitad de cancha.**
Ter Stegen sometimes can do 2v20 (with Messi) but the other times he just stood still and pretended that the shot is too hard
Ter Stegen has dropped off quite a lot tbh - 2014 till the liv loss he was always top 3/5 in the world and top 2 for ball distribution with neuer
"Tek also doesn't have those bozo moments like ter stegen. He's very good on set pieces not because of height but because of his style. 

Don't think I've seen him concede with a big mistake like stegen. 2 seasons ago I would have said Ter stegen was the superior keeper though."
"he still does a lot of late tackles to my liking, that one against dortmund was too funny"
Bro thinks they have a chance
"like a baby, lol. thanks kounde for helping me sleep well, and to get two bastards sent off."
"We can't even rest lamine, cubarsi, pedri, kounde or raphinha until the coming Clasico ends. This is getting really close to high injury risk territory for basically all of them(raph has seemed slower these past few matches and cubarsi never gets mentioned by people in this conversation)."
"This is part of the reason his intensity is dropping. Look at his running stats over the season, and you'll see that he covers a shockingly small amount of distance (well into UCL Vini territory). He's clearly been instructed to not overdo it, because they've prioritized giving him as many minutes as possible."
11 v 15. dont forget the herbert the pervert!!!!
"M afraid they really dont know that.. proof? Go check rm sub. Those guys are even justifying rudinger bottle throw with excuses like ""any passionate player would lose his mind with ref mistake"""
"Ramos mentality without Ramos skills, rudiger deserved the red card."
"Yeah, it comes down to personal choice.

It's Zizou for me because I doubt we'll ever get to see something like the threepeat again - that squad was just unstoppable and so fun to watch.

But don Carlo delivered the decima, the most entertaining CL run of all time and another very entertaining one with an incomplete squad. And he overall has the most trophies in Real Madrid history."
The don imo
"Lucas, Ceballos, Rodrygo and (arguably)Fran were all awful as well"
"There was a season when I saw players broke through 1 v 1 him that my heart didn’t even beat faster because he was so consistent at coming out top winning that duel. The surprise is when they do actually score, not that he beat the attacker.

Imagine that form with Hansi’s high line. If it ain’t the team actively offside trapping you successfully, there’s still a final boss that will get you."
"Bro, if there is a keeper who embodies bozo moments then that is Szczesny, love him but sometimes he makes brainless decisions"
Didnt Tek give away a penalty stupidly vs Dortmund not even 2 weeks ago. Sure he recovered and made a good game after that but still saying he doesn't have bozo moments is just not true.
"Tek has his bozo moments too. Even in Italy, a known negative trait of his is him mistiming coming out only to foul the players. Here at Barca you got that plus the collisions against his teammates, it stems from the same principle."
"> Tek also doesn't have those bozo moments

I assure you he does."
"Yeah, his late tackles seem very desperate at times. Hard to pass full judgment since our defense is reduced to meme-level at certain points, but he and Araujo definitely have some bad individual mistakes."
Fran was great man. Yamal did not have a lot of joy on the dribbling side of things. You know a LB has done well against him when his highlights are mainly his passing.
Fran was good though?
"As many as Ter stegen?

Ter stegen also seems pretty mid in big matches"
Lolol. I never knew he did that in Italy too
I didn’t think so but we can agree to disagree
"I love Tek but this is an insane take, I know he wasn’t completely matchfit yet but he had his insane headloss vs real earlier this season and a couple of bozo moments vs benfica"
Let's not forget about red card vs Madrid and Pavlidis' hattrick
Madrid TV is going to declare world war 3.
I got to say Rudiger was close to getting restraining order.
Rudiger threw something at the ref. Crazy dude.
1/3 of a game each.
"Rudiger should be banned. Not from the refs, from madrid themselves. Can’t they see what he was behaving like?"
Who else besides Rudiger?
it keeps getting better we on a historical hatewatch run
"Does that mean they don't play against us, or they just apply for the next Copa season? This might be huge for us hahaha"
Livescore is showing Rudiger and Lucas Vasquez with red cards.  Who's the third player?
"Generational crash out. First the organization crashed out with all the refereeing drama, and then the players themselves. It's a truly great time to be a Barcelona fan or even a Real Madrid hater. I'm guessing Liverpool fans have really enjoyed the last 24 hours lol."
"Marca is shit I can't see the article fuck

Lucas should be one of them 100%. The fucker jumped far into the pitch yelling at the ref like a madman. We just got distracted by the psyco of Rudiger casting his ice spells at the ref lmao"
Referee making up for his in-match performance
do these mean anything?
If La Liga doesnt hand out very severe punishments everyone will finally realize the corruption in favor of Real Madrid.
Livescore says Lucas Vazquez and Rudiger but who’s the third player?
Rudiger is truly a Pepe/Ramos regen
Inject it into my veins
OP needs to be sent off this sub for posting half ass information
"All this aside, I just want to talk about Arda Guler. Boy put in a 'Fuck you, Carlo' performance today. What a talent left to rot for nothing 

Mbappe was massive too"
is it across all matches or just copa del rey? 
"Still fucking angry he got away with literally pushing olmo who was running against him , then literally planted his feet not attempting for the ball the second time and then swiped ferran of the back of his feet and the idiot got red carded after all this shit show damm ."
Madrid haters eating really good today
"Rudiger, Vazquez and who?

Edit: Gonna guess Vinicius as he ran on the pitch in the same incident as Rudiger"
"These are the ""classy"" team who used to mock Xavi for talking about referring."
Team seems to have just completely lost all discipline. Pretty embarrassing behaviour tonight.
Absolute cinema
"What baffles me is how they think every decision that goes their way is correct and everything that doesn’t is an abomination. 

Look I get that’s football in a nutshell but this is different level. I’d say Barca were clearly more hard done by this game and any rational person would say that. 

So this victim mentality wherever it comes from has to stop. You cannot have a player or players react like that. You’re fucking millionaires playing a game at the end of the day. Get a grip. 

The fans aren’t innocent either. It is rotten how entitled this club is. It’s not a cute gimmick or expecting the best. All it does is make people root for you to lose which of course adds to the victim complex that’s so craved. And the cycle continues."
"Deserved. Absolutely embarrassing and disgraceful from Rudiger and others.
WTF was that attempt to throw ice pack at the referee."
30 minutes of community service and they can play next matchday
"The incoming manager has a helluva job getting these man to stop behaving like brats and instead show their abilities on the field. Farming all this ego is a massive task in itself, forget tactics and making them fit on the field. "
"You know they were saving this outrage until they knew they would lose.

Made about the refs before the game, during the game and after the game. Which I am certain that will not be the end of that.

Exactly as they planned, now they can play and spin this whole ""oh they punished us because of refs pre-game comment blabla""."
I think Vini got one because official Barcelona account tweeted a red card to Vini.
RMTV is gonna make a film trilogy and TV drama series about the ref.
Should be Lucas and Vinicius who were the cunts going into the pitch in the final play
This man ruidiger was about to commit attempted murder
Do they all fit in the clown car?
"Hopefully we get a coach with a belt next season, unacceptable behavior at the end, not even Ramos would throw shit at the ref"
Do they carry over to the league?
"what can you say, actions have consequences?"
"Really embarrassing for them as professional players and looks really bad for the club. 


I doubt they will but Madrid should fine the players for this, inexcusable behavior."
"Referee gave a red card basically to RM TV, well deserved. "
The sorest losers
Honestly ref lost the game when he did not put a red on Tchouameni in 1st half. He let real Madrid players and coaches become more and more virulent and obnoxious at every possible action afterwards. You could feel all that pressure Madrid put last week on the ref really pay off during the game...
Honest question. The Barca corner where the ball bounced off the post it looked like Lucas literally dragged down the Barca player by the shirt to prevent the tap in. How is that not a pen?
"This is better than any show on netflix. Please keep up the good work, Madrid. Gracias."
"I feel like, RMTV, or rather the club Madrid's tactic of pushing the us against the whole world narrative is doing the people who actually participate on the field some serious disadvantage.


Even Mou wouldn't have dreamed of this. I hope Xabi Alonso brings some of the gentlemen mood back.


Right now they are eating their own bile up."
Who aside from Rudiger got reds? Can’t make it out from the article
"The Spanish league has allowed Real Madrid disgraceful behavior for too long. They need to bring the hammer down on these guys, BAN RUDIGER!!!!!"
Referee woke up after the final whistle just to hand out cards. He was sleeping the whole match.
"Vini and rudiger deserve some serious punishment

The former was on the pitch when he was already sub off and the later throwing something to the ref."
Be nice if they actually got them during the game
Nothing happens after this. Disgraceful players!
It is now abundantly clear how dirty the team is. From unnecessary drama about refs to this.
Congratulations to real for radicalising their players. Enjoy the fruits of your hard work.
"What a calm, measured and consummate professional, the experienced 32-year old Rudiger is here to show such restraint in the face of adversity towards his adversary, the ref. /s"
Absolute meltdown
Doubt we’ll see any suspensions.
"Real Madrid, for how prestigious their team is sure have a sht ton of clowns playing for them with even worse clowns on the management not being able to control them."
If only our president was focused on our squad rather than the super league. Time to give Vini an ultimatum. Focus or leave
Rudiger is fucking maniac
What a fucking shit show as a rm fan. SMH.
do they miss next season copa del rey or do they miss la liga games?
"Deserved it 

  
they are just garbage players

  
LOSERS."
They went ballistic when the ref called a foul correctly. Can't make this shit up
Please be Vini instead if Bellingham. Cant lose Jude.
Sadly all after the game. We all know which player should have received a red instead of a yellow in the first half.
God is good
They see the club acting out there just following
"Jokes aside, Rudiger is very scary and intimidating. I really don't wanna mess with that guy. He can explode at any time and crazy stuff will happen"
Tchouameni should've gotten one for his scissor tackle
What an bunch of losers.
Ha peasants
“But the refs”
Real MadDiva
It was a really lame foul tho. Not excusing any behaviour.
And 3 of them avoid them during the game
Penalti al favor del real madrid.
Crazy German won Chelsea the champions league and I’ll always love him for that but he’s clearly deranged 🤣. Everyone on this sub talks about the loss of passion from these overpaid mercenaries but when someone shows heart we crucify them.
can't wait for the ref compilation.
Perez going to tariff Uefa.
Can't wait to see what they cook up for the classico in couple weeks. Most entitled paired with the biggest victim complex
Will be a fine show... an ocean of tears expected.
I wonder what he would've done if they didn't restrain him.
Good thing he’s a footballer and not in the mafia
There's legit no reason for him to even be that angry when the ref let him get away with so much on the pitch. He's the football version of Draymond Green brilliant players who cant stop being assholes
Why not name the three players in the title of the post?
Another 1 match ban incoming for three of them.
Should be an instant exit from the club.
He’s genuinely such a horrible player. A pretty awful person too - especially after the way he treated the Real Madrid coach a year or so ago.
Took three people to hold him down as well. Unacceptable behavior from him
"That's what you get when a whole club goes on a delusional entitled tantrum for months. It enables the craziest of them acting out like this. Won't be a bit shocked if some fan does something regrettably worse to someone in future. Not saying their fanbase is like this, it's just something that this kind of deranged campaign takes out of the worst of any group."
He threw his runners up medal at him.
Collectively*
Sounds fair to me
Out of control. No discipline. Disgusting behaviour.
Entitled asshole who bullies other people? He fits right in
Lmao commentators saying that's a lengthy ban. Mfkers that's a restraining order look at his eyes. Watch it be a 1 match ban
"Either banned for a long time or just straight up kicked out of the club, this behavior should not be tolerated"
He was MAD. I’d be pretty worried if I was one of the Madrid training staff tomorrow
"Why would he?



Perez is pursuing a policy of arguing with everyone over everything, fuck knows what for



I can imagine he likes seeing that, if he doesn't, he sure doesn't behave much differently"
He’s been doing this shit for years. He should have at least a 6 month ban with no pay or something similar.
Madrid condone this behaviour though. Long list of dirty players
Rudiger is looking at them with anger in their eyes
They will not renew him. Im sure
Kinda hard to ban the only *reasonably* fit CB they have.
na big pr bits incoming. same as when that video of him slapping the kitman was leaked
"Madrid would be glad for it, though. Entitlement is the point!"
Madrid isn't really known for being professional football club
"Lucas Vazquez got one, I received the notification from One football. I don't know who the last one is."
"“Vini and Jude Bellingham went over to the referee after FT, and he gave them one of them a red card. Unclear which”

-Rodra on X

One to Rudiger, One to Vazquez and a third one to either Jude or Vini."
"Fabrizio Romano says it was Vasquez, Bellingham and vini."
"Vazquez is one but I have no clue who else, Vini was also going on to the pitch shouting"
"Its actually 4 players
Rudiger
Lucas
Bellingham 
Vini"
Vazquez and I don't know the third but probably Vini?
"Vasquez and for the third ony Marca doesn't know either. They just write ""there was a third red card, we'll see for whom"" and then that's it."
Vazquez and an Unknown one.
Vasquez and Bellingham
"Walked onto the pitch with a cryin ref who let him get away with anything. Bruh left his knee on the field. Gave it all he had. Lost brutally and took out his frustration on the weakest person out there: the ref. 
It ain't right.... but I understand."
Tune in next weekend for more!
boutta have a nice sleep
When’s the next one
Generational crashout
Tomorrow we'll get Negreira news.
"Thats what i was thinking, their defeat was good, this made it even better lmfaoo"
Keeping up with the Galacticashians.
Generational headloss hatewatch is what I've learnt from this sub
"Isreal Madrid hate watch > Yanited hate watch. 


Harry Maguire is at least a likeable dude compared to Galactichole Rudiger. "
"It depends on how long the ban is, I believe."
"Rudiger absolute getting banned, 10+ games "
Either Vini or Bellingham. Still unsure who
Scorecard on Google confirms it's Bellingham 
Well I for one am absolutely feasting right now. Absolute toxic cesspit a certain free agent will be joining
Oh I'm absolutely loving it
"This was an amazing hate watch. The tantrums, the crash outs. PIT IT IN MY VEINS!!!"
"As a Bundesliga fan, I used to despise Madrid for getting away with offside goal and all favorable decisions against Bayern in crucial UCL games. Was never really a hater, but now I am.


I hate Yanited for covering up poor club management with PR, even against their own players, but Madrid is just a disgrace to football. 


Can't imagine the times I used to worship Zidane playing for this dirty club and constantly played RM in Fifa 2004-ish times. "
"I actually went to sleep in extra time and missed quite a show :(

You can see that the RM ref pressure worked, they were too lenient on many occasions. Also the pull when the ball hit the post from the corner, boy how does VAR miss that???"
Such a plastic club lmfao. Do any “Madrid supporters” who didn’t grow up in Madrid even watch their games if it isn’t a cup final? Pathetic ass fan base and club.
"Hey, whenever Madrid, Barca or United are in the shithole, I'm eating my man"
I never understood why people liked to be called “haters” it’s such a weird thing for me regardless of what club it is
It seemed like it was Lucas and Vini.
ice spells lmao. That’s some black magic shit.
I for one vote for the lengthy ban to be given to Vazquez instead.
He’ll show this and say see I carded Real
"I think the referee did a very solid job considering the insane pressure  of the match and all the bullshit whines from Madrid last days.

The only stains in this match came from plays I understand him not calling and that the VAR mysteriously ignored"
He’s going to write in his report that Rudiger was actually justified and shouldn’t be banned.
"Honestly I think the ref handled this match really well. Were there inaccurate whistles? Sure. But good luck reffing a super intense match between arguably the most famous rival clubs in sports history for 120 mins. This match had an insane amount of 50/50s and I wouldn't say all of them went one way at all. Also kept it pretty tame, not even a single actual fight"
"Yeah let's just keep on hating the referees, that will lead to a healthier culture in football around them. Such a cowardly move to try to put down a person brave enough to go make decisions in a game like this. Every player figthing with every trick they have, bending the rules, trying to find the gray area and get the advantage. 

But sure, the referees have an easy job and you could do better from your sofa, without even thinking about it too much."
"What the fuck are you talking about, especially when you factor in how awful Spanish refs are, and how tense this match was and how much shit was thrown around it before it started the ref did really damn well"
The carry over to the league ( if i am not mistaken)
"If they are reds+sanction, they'll miss games in La Liga. Ruddiger's one may (and should) be a long ban."
Regular reds I don't think so but I believe sanctions on any Spanish competition carry over to la Liga don't they?
They might miss the la liga el classico
Ronaldo got 5 match ban for a very slight push on this exact same ref. Only way Rudiger doesn’t get at least an equally long ban is if they say it’s cause the object didn’t make contact.
We already saw it today with the referee giving everything to Madrid and ignoring 2 blatant pens and 2 red cards
"They will be slapped with a ban enough to cause damage to the season but also in a way that seems Real Madrid have the referees in their pocket. So maybe 1-2 game ban or until Clasico. But people will forget it takes two to be corrupt.... so the way I see it either the refs are complicit or incompetent. Or they will put some ungodly ban just to flex their authority or as revenge for the ref comments saga. 

I don't know what is the proper punishment but it must be by the book and not arbitrary, otherwise its just corruption."
"Come on, the corruption in favor of Real is already obvious to anyone who's honest with themselves. With the amount of questionable decisions they benefited from in the past years, at this point I think a Real player would have to get away with literal murder for anything to change"
He somehow is worse
"I wouldn't compare rudriger to them man , swear they both were shitty but i don't think they ever had 3 man holding them from beating the ref"
Literally threw ice at the referee. Needs an 8 game ban minimum.
Maybe I’m deluding myself because I rate him so highly but I don’t ever remember Ramos being this unhinged towards a ref at least. 
"Hey man even Marca did not know the third player who was sent off lol, it was bellingham if you are wondering."
"Yeah, who is this 3rd player? Not mentioned in article"
Guler and Mbappe made me jealous of Madrid's bench.
"Took Carlo til the end of the season to figure out that having both Arda and Luka on at the same time on the pitch helps a lot, lmao

I'm curious to see what our new manager will do with Arda"
all matches
I'm a fat little piggy on this blessed day.
Vazquez? And Vini
Ceballos i think
Up the post they mentioned Jude. It seems he approached the referee after the game.
What Vazquez do ? Only got notification nothing else
Ice wizard from cr
Anyone with more than a single braincell should be able to see right through it. The red kept favouring them all through the match
Looked like he threw something as well maybe
They only got two red cards?
"Ngl Ramos was the dirtiest player player ever, but he did have his limits. Rudiger doesn't, he is a fucking unhinged animal. Can't imagine how much he would have lost his mind if he had to face Messi and co."
"Nothing will change, this is an issue with your club from Perez down. 

Till the culture changes, you'll continue to have this behaviour."
Vazquez is the other one. 3rd maybe Vinicius but I’m not sure.
Same. No consequences for the football darlings. The money makers for suits they won’t allow it
"
“Vini and Jude Bellingham went over to the referee after FT, and he gave them one of them a red card. Unclear which”

-Rodra on X


One to Rudiger, One to Vazquez and a third one to either Jude or Vini."
Dude your season is over I think you can stop worrying
You did this whole game and did alright
Bellingham got red
"You know, in Brazilian football, Corinthians and Internacional had been brewing a rivalry, mostly due to refereeing controversies in previous years.

So, in 2009, they were set to decide the Copa do Brasil final (Brazil’s version of the CdR), when Internacional’s president announced he had delivered a DVD compilation of refereeing mistakes favoring Corinthians to the CBF.

Corinthians won the final, and a few years later, they would put up ‘[Put it on the DVD](https://jpimg.com.br/uploads/2017/04/2212342494-o-poe-no-dvd-estampou-o-telao-da-arena-corinthians-no-ano-passado.jpg)’ on the stadium displays after beating Internacional.

Just an idea if any of you guys happen to know whoever works the displays at the Camp Nou."
Ref was fair if not lenient today.
"They already did the compilation, and referee decid3not to disappoint them"
"It would be amazing if Barca wins it before the Classico. 

I don’t know about la liga tradition but something like a virtual guard of honor in a Classico during that season would be hilarious."
reminds me of israel
That game is going to be bonkers.
"As a non-Spanish speaker I think he may have been shouting “hold me back, hold me back”"
a 1 match ban
"If it was any other player, I'd say threats and taunting toward the ref at most and that'd be it.

But Rüdiger is genuinely insane. I would not have been surprised if he would've went WWE style on the ref"
Absolutely nothing like the bitch he is.
"Probably nothing, he knew they wouldn’t let him go and started to put on a show"
"Yeah, Mendy and that coaching staff maybe saved him from some jail time"
Absolutely nothing. He knew they'd hold him back. He wanted to look like a tough guy
Nothing. He was putting on a show.
I'm pretty sure he was trying to throw additional ice when they restrained him.
yep. for now.
He’s not even that good anymore.
"It's the Madrid DNA. The most entitled, whiny, and insufferable club in the world. They literally never stop bitching about being treated unfair. When it's demonstrably not true. "
"I cant argue the asshole part of Draymond Green.

But Dray is one of the greatest defender the game ever seen.

Attitude wise, pretty similar. But skill wise, they are not on the same level."
"Rüdiger, Vázquez and the third is for Bellingham according to Arancha Rodríguez (Cadena Cope) though Marca notes ""We're still waiting for the report"""
With the option that any one of the three can serve out the ban
"So is nobody understanding german here? He clearly called the ref a ""son of a b*tch"" (H*rensohn) like 5 times. Once was really loud then they went ahead to mute the sound."
"Tuchel deserves a lot of credit for coaching Rüdiger to play clean at Chelsea. 

He had one collision with KdB and (i think?) a biting incident if I'm remembering correctly.  But that was pretty much it. 

Ever since he's moved to Madrid idk what it is but clearly he's been given free reign to be as dirty as possible."
This sub has no understanding of a sarcasm lol
I will upvote for their ignorance
Fits right in.
Galactic-hole
Bro makes pepe look tame
It’s most likely a minimum 4 (4-11) for aggression towards a ref. Because it’s so many they will be carried during the league games.
Remember that  video of him being a fucking dick with the kit man? I’ve wanted him out since then but since hes good it won’t happen
Rudiger should receive a huge ban and I fucking hate the prick. But no shot Madrid bans him. They had Ramos and Pepe for around a decade.
"Yeah but your club will continue to encourage aggression towards referees like it always has, and pretend that he’s been hard done by."
"It's not worse than Pepe trying to remove a players spine with his boots, so doubt it"
Brother it’s your whole club lmfao. What about Vini and Rodrygo
"This is the reality from the top down Madrid wanted to make a ""us against the world"" thing. I would say from Perez it's to distract from the fact yous aren't winning shit all this year despite the years chasing Mbappe. 

Rudi losing his head is a mix of him being a little nuts anyway plus Madrid leadership trying to demonize this referring team."
Probably Vini since he also rushed out onto the pitch like Vazquez
Fabrizio's post says Jude got one too
"i think it was three not including rudiger, as in 3 received them after the match not total. vazquez bellingham and vini"
Some webpages were saying bellingham
"Damn, one football sending red cards out here to viewers. Really tough. Enjoy your three match suspension."
"I fast read the sentence as 'Lucas got one, I received one' and did a double take "
Wtf are they bitching about? That Ferran didn't get a penalty? That Modric didn't get a red?
Hopefully both.
Bellingham was the 3rd red card.
My guess is vini...
Then it's four with Rudiger. Complete meltdown.
What a shock the entitled pricks of the team.
Real Madrid Z!
"City vs forest 🤞

Definitely not any other 4:30 games"
May 11 Clasico
It really depends on what the referee writes in the postmatch. One word can mean 3 matches and another just 1.
"Yeah, I read that's the case. Let's hope Rudiger at least doesn't play, so we can get more chances of beating Madrid."
"Probably 0 matches, given that he plays for Real Madrid"
"What fucking clowns, mentality midgets as soon as they don't win. And I speak from experience having watched my team in UCL."
"Bro I was wondering why Liverpool fans started hating all of a sudden, I completely forgot about Trent. 
Also, why are Dortmund fans hating? What’s going on?"
Can't wait for RM defense to be even more shit. It's already the worst I have seen in my 25 years of watching this game.
If only there were a German word for that feeling.
"It had **EVERYTHING**

Literally every single thing that could've gone wrong for Madrid went wrong. Including a fake Remontada and all their cockiest players getting red cards post match. So satisfying."
I take it these carry over into the league or does Spain have a different setup.
He’ll put on the sheet they were clearly going to play the ball and will receive a 1 match ban
"100% the usually post match statistics fixing, will make everyone happy"
"Missing at least one penalty, forgetting to card Real players  so often and keeping Tchouameni on the pitch is far from a solid job. I understand the pressure but it seems it worked"
I think so too. The ref did an amazing job in a match like this. He's very consistent in similar situations for both teams.
"Missing at least one penalty, forgetting to card Real players  so often and keeping Tchouameni on the pitch is far from a solid job. I understand the pressure but it seems it worked"
"No, he didn't, he crumbled other than a few correct decisions."
"Oh come on. Var could have atleast reviewed Ferran and Cubarsi incidents. Pedri and Olmo were hacked down multiple times in the first 30 mins without any action too. 

Referee encouraged petulant behaviour from Madrid by favouring them overall because of the prematch pressuring and sadly will still be called a thief."
"Besides not giving 2 clear pens (without counting raphinha's dive cause that was a clear dive) and also not carding half the madrid team, yeah I would say he handled it pretty well. It's even hard to blame the man for any inconsistencies after all the drama"
"Most 50/50 calls went in favor of Madrid. 2 clearish penalties for Barça that weren't given. A bunch of yellow cards not given to L. Vázquez, Tchouameni, Rudiger, Asencio. They kicked the shit out of Barça players during the game.

Let's see what he writes in the game report because Rudiger should get a 6-10 game ban for that. Bellingham probably insulted him, and should get multiple games... And RMTV will most likely spin that against the ref saying he showed his disdain and bias against them."
Yeah I thought the on-field ref did alright all things considered. The VAR on the other hand seemed a little bit biased to me.
While the first half he did pretty disastrously he did pretty fine the rest of the match. I was worried the madrid boycott wouldve made them be nicer to them but im glad he did his job at the end.
No hate. Just sympathy.
"He wasn't good, man. In the first half, he was letting Madrid get away with shit. Ceballos slap on Yamal, Ceballos pull on Cubarsi's potential tap-in, Tchouameni scissor tackle, Asensio behind-the-back tackle.  
He became better as the match went on though."
This is such a great comment.
"Oh RM fan there. Honestly, quite disappointed with how Madrid chooses to focus on non footballing things and tries to influence the game outside the pitch despite having one of the best squads there is. Can’t defend, can’t attack, can’t pass. Just keep protesting like entitled kids"
That’s why clear card fouls on Olmo and Pedri weren’t even considered in the first half? The ref was clearly influenced by Madrid pregame pressure and tended to favor them overall.
"I think they carry only if the offence is serious. This means that if it's three or more matches ban, they carry to the league. That was the whole situation with Mbappe's red. He was at risk of not playing only if he got at least three or four iirc."
"It carries on to the next cup amtches, but if the ban them for 3+ games (Remember Mbappe red card debate) they will be banned also for league games."
Not if they reduce it to a 1 match ban. I'm sure there is a chance Madrid appeals and they get rescinded too 😅
I believe if its less than a 3 game ban in Spain I believe it doesn't carry to other domestic competitions. So they'll be banned for the first round of the copa next year - similar to when Madrid got disqualified from the tournament because they missed that Cheryshev was suspended from the copa and fielded him.
Rudiger > Pepe > Ramos in terms of shittiness
"If Mbappe got just a 1-match ban for that horrific tackle, I don't see how any of these three players get anything more."
"Not only that he also gave 2 not existent pen to real, offside saved us."
also their two scorers shouldnt have been on the pitch... mbappe should have been suspended and tchoumeni should have seen red earlier
Blatant pens?
Nothing is worse than Pepe
What Rudiger did is fucked up but I'd rather have him throw an ice pack at me from a distance than Pepe winding up to kick me like he's trying to make a PRIDE soccer kick compilation.
"That I agree, Pepe and Ramos got hot headed always when they were losing in classicos, then they played super dirty.

But the amount of dirty tackles from Rudi is out of this world. Mans dancing around getting a red every other game."
Pepe committed legit assault
Pepe straight up assaulted assaulted Football players
Tbf Pepe did that to opposition players not referees
"Bro really forgot about prime Pepe  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKt4IBxD5oo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKt4IBxD5oo)"
Just like Mbappe got for trying to break a guys leg?
Ronaldo got 5 match ban for a very slight push on this exact same ref. Only way Rudiger doesn’t get at least an equally long ban is if they say it’s cause the object didn’t make contact.
"Ref no, but if you watched the classicos where Real got repeatedly whooped by Guardiolas Barca. You could see the man was on a mission to break legs."
It looked like he was just throwing his arm out in protest. If anything it was him nothing off because you could see he was definitely swearing at the ref after the red
jude i think
We are 1 point behind if we win the clasico. Its the hope that kills you.
"My entire knowledge of Brazil could most certainly summerized in roughly a dozen sentences, but whenever you banter I instantly connect with that, cuz it has kinda the same vibes as balkans banter.

Cheers."
That's hilarious
"Would've been crazy but no chance now. There's just one game before classico, three after and 4 point difference."
"Real Madrid, the Israel of Football"
Reddit try not to get political moment
He was shouting profanities in German
Anyone who shouts “hold me back” while actively choosing to act like that is mentally unwell. Fully aware that how he’s behaving is wrong but doing it anyway. 
"The funny part is not Rudiger saying whatever, is the guy who first locked him saying ""Ayudadme, ayudadme"" ""Help me, help me"" bcs he was looking himself helpless trying to Hodor him."
K&Peele style!
He doesn’t fight anyone who can fight back
"""Let me at em, let me at em"""
They'll explain tomorrow how he was doing it respectfully like Jude was. Never have I seen such a dislikable squad of utter bellends
Because he was doing unhinged things respectfully!
with any other player yeah but Rudiger is an actual mental case so who knows
"Nah, just played the role like anyone held back. People act like he will fight someone for real on the football pitch, let alone the ref"
Yeah draymond green is still an amazing defensive player… Rudiger was awful tonight
Watching Casemiro at RM made my blood boil if he was anywhere else he would not finish half of the matches he played
"I get that people are mad at Rudiger right now, but the dude is a really good player. He's an idiot, but he's one of the best CBs in the world"
And the ref needs to pay their fines.
He can fuck right off.
Just Ancelotti giving him freedom to express himself
Just the old biting incident
Just calling it a collision is more than than that twat deserves. He intended to smash in kdbs face.
Always felt he did that to KdB on purpose but the general opinion around the time was that it was accidental. Thing time is proving that I was likely right.
Oh I know what it is
how many times have you copy and pasted this?
Replacing Ramos with something even more insane…
"Wasn’t clean at all at Chelsea, he was a right dirty cunt"
Man really posting that exact same comment on every single thread about the game
You don’t need discipline when it’s impossible to be punished. The devils club.
"The minimum clearly doesn’t mean anything anymore though, given Mbappé got 1 match for a straight-red (after already accruing enough points for a 2 match ban per La Liga rules) mere weeks ago"
"Yeah there’s a good bit of over reacting here. 

Like don’t these lads know that for every generationally gifted teenager Barcelona have, Madrid balance it out with a wall to wall fucking lunatic. 

It’s the yin and yang of Spanish football."
"There is report on X that Vini and Jude went to the ref after FT, ref showed red but unclear to whom"
Yeah it looked like he threw something as well
It's that mouth of his. You just know it.
"Probably told the referee to fuck off, like he always does. Always whining."
This sub and its PR machine about to have a meltdown. JUDE!?!?! You mean the guy who they say is above Zidane in his prime?
"I hope, he didn't deserved to finish the 90 minutes. What a dirty cunt."
Who was it that almost killed Dani olmo?
Saying that Mbappe’s foul wasn’t a foul
What happened with Modric? I must have missed something.
Unironically yes as someone who hates you both. You losing doesn’t do anything but delay the inevitable
Can we just draw the other game please?
"I mean, I'd probably lost it it isn't a long ban. Though I wouldn't be surprised at the same time."
"""Rudiger looked at me with the purest, seething rage in his eyes; the man was out for murder.  I was not safe, save for the three men holding him back.  I feared for my life.""

""Right, that's a game ban then."""
It would be a disgrace if Rudiger got away lightly with this.
Fuck I hope you guys humiliate them. Please bro
after todays game I think he is seriously injured. I don't see him playing anymore this season.
Also would be great for your players physical health
Guess what team Dortmund lost the ucl finals to last year and it’s easy to hate on Madrid this year given their whiny bitching record.
"Brother, Liverpool lost two UCL finals against Madrid within 4 years, plus another elimination, it's no surprise here.


Edit: Even with the Trent drama."
I've seen chelsea fans supporting barca over madrid recently so that should really say something
Cause Madrid robbed them of two UCL’s
All of a sudden?
Everyone hates the most successful team in sports.. its universal
Generational hate watch 😂😂
The Rudiger one definitely carries over to the leauge. If the Jude Lucas and Vini reds are bad enough to be a 3 game ban then yes most likely else it'll just be the next conpa game next season
"The ref doesnt control the VAR room.  He did well this game, ESPECIALLY considering what La Liga refs are normally like."
"1. Var reviews are not the ref's responsibility
2. As I said, there were inaccurate decisions (much in madrids favor in the first half) but I think as time went on there were less and less, whistle balanced out and in the ET if anything, barca had the better whistle.
3. Real vs barca is literally the hardest match to referee, ever. Because it's not only super aggressive but also super high stakes and everyone's eyes are on the ref. Especially with all the built up pressure RM had on the ref before the match, it's really hard to not take any bias whichever way in a situation like that."
"Cubarsi and Ceballos were grabbing each other mutually until almost the last second, that’s a good no call. I agree with the Ferran incident, it merits a review though I don’t know if it caused his fall"
"Which was the other clear penalty? I was 100% pulling for barca this match but I thought ferran penalty was too soft and even the cubarsi one could be argued to be a double foul.

I do agree first half was reffed pretty poorly in terms of real getting away with too many harsh fouls. But it's real, this is expected."
"I mean Tchouameni got a card, it was just the wrong color."
VAR made his job a lot harder. The two penalties call should’ve happened and he got no support there
What are you talking about you're the one talking about the refs supposed failings
"Dissapointed. Although seeing that Rudiger behaviour, I wouldn't discard a long ban. Let's hope they can't play against us next week."
I'm a Barca fan but those two were definitely pens imo if they werent offside
That Getafe meltdown of his.. Ill never forget it
Pepe was a better defender than Rudiger
"Pepe and Ramos are thuggish on the pitch, Rud is thuggish both on and off the pitch"
Pepe was worse in in-match cuntery. Rudiger is worse when you combine his in-match and outside of the pitch cuntery
This was his first red in a Madrid uniform.
"Ramos then , pepe was a bald headed baddie"
"Surely not, the Mbappe one can be considered (if you really need to go to spec savers) an attempt to play the ball. This is straight up trying to injure the ref, and then probably insulting him for a good minute while needing to be held back. This should be a long ban."
Either way.  A subbed out player entering the pitch and screaming and swearing at the refs is surely deserving of a red anyways
i want your optimism
we've lost the past 4 games against Barca
He basically didnt play today
"Many of us in this region (north Argentina / south Brazil) are Balkan descendants 

Yesterday I learned that a town near from where I live has the biggest Montenegrin diaspora"
Ah ok. That’s too bad lol
After the game then? ^^
"""no politik here"""
Human rights are more than just politics
"Look who's talking, the Bayern fan 🤣"
"yeah, hurensohn and mistgeburt were very easy to hear hahaha"
"Scheiße

Edit: spelling"
"""Holden Mein Baken!"""
It’s Rudiger. Him being mentally unwell is known and accepted
"I wouldn't say mentally unwell. I think anyone who is mentally unwell just charges towards their target without shouting for people to hold them back. Those who do say ""hold me back"" come across as performative and overly dramatic. But not as someone whose anger you should take seriously. Like sure, go ahead, release him. See what he would do. I'd be surprised if it's anything physical."
"More like ""hold me back"" means that it's just posturing. If he was actually unhinged he wouldn't ask people to hold him back."
He wasn't shouting hold me back
A guy I used to hang out with was bit mental. Picked a lot of fights at bars but would only really try to go at with someone if we were “holding him back”. One day we got sick of this happening and just let him go after going total aggro. Not surprising he got his ass kicked. We stopped hanging out with after that. 
"Yeah welcome to hyper competitiveness in capitalism.

The same behavior happens in corporate world, among the rich, politicians etc. It's just more visual in sports since they are already doing a physical activity. But behind closed doors politicians get angry and irrational too ans go and make policies to harm those without power."
"Your word choice ""actively choosing"" exemplifies you don't know what you're criticizing"
"Players routinely get 3-5 game bans in Spain just for saying that a ref was bad or they were robbed, if they translate the stuff Rudiger was saying there were like 10 very bad German insults much worse than that kind of stuff lol"
I’m glad somebody said it.  I think they’re the worst bunch of twats I can ever recall.
"Chances are never 0% ofc you never know
edit: plus he already got the red card"
"You can replace Casemiro with Sergio Ramos , Pepe, or Arbeloa and it still holds true. It's got to be a culture thing by this point"
Do you guys like him ?
"And smashing another players face intentionally taking him out from the most important game of his life. You know ... the usual stuff.

But seriously, Rudiger is such a deranged player that those being the two biggest incidents for a couple of years at Chelsea makes Tuchel a prime candidate for best psychiatrist of all time. He collects 2 jail worthy moments per game now"
"Seriously, it's mind blowing that these cases aren't reported to the police. Or if they are, I'm not aware of it and the press should talk much more about and make it very clear that such behavior have consequences beyond the football field.  
This is very important to set and example for amateur football too. Where I live there's no problem with violence in society at large, yet amateur football has become frankly scary. People are starting to use it as an outlet for their violent urges, knowing there's no real-world consequence unless they go way way overboard.

Of course there are some inherent risks to the sport, and when you step on the field you agree that if you're victim of e.g., a bad tackle, you just let the referee do justice. I'm also happy that I don't have to fear legal consequences everytime I step on the field, as long as I am exercising fair-play.  
Biting is not part of that agreement. Fuck biting and fuck biters. The UEFA is making a joke of itself by allowing biters to ever play again."
"> Thing time is proving that I was likely right.

Time really didn't change much here, he had these Issues in Stuttgart, this is why he took the detour over Roma, before he signed with a big club.

Plus him doing dumb shit afterwards doesn't mean, that this specific incident can't be different."
"Anyone saying it was accidental is stupid. To this day I have yet to see any other player make a front on challenge leading with their shoulder. If his aim was to stop kdb, an arm would have come out to drag him back. His only aim was to hurt him."
"It's just something that was in my head for weeks really, and since he lost his head today it seemed like a good time to talk about it. 

This Rüdiger is genuinely not the same player that he was at Chelsea. You watch replays of him and it's crazy to see how many dirty plays he's started doing regularly since he moved to Madrid. 

I think people don't fully appreciate the impact the coaching staff has on this behavior. Tuchel literally used to make the players practice with tennis balls in their hands so they couldn't grab onto shirts. 

It just seems like Madrid have told him to approach with a different philosophy and try to be as disruptive as possible."
Prolly the PR Merchant who curses at refs.
Nah he just threw his hand in dissent
Him and Rudiger are a genuine embarrassment
He was complaining to the refs at half time in the tunnel 🤣🤣
Respectfully though?
"No that’s just the English in him, it’s a term of endearment here

/s"
"Another cunt get's a red card, no surprise"
We have a winner
Tchouaméni that was a red as well tbf
Olmo was hit so many times in the first half.
"Both Tchouameni and Rudiger in the first half. Tchoui's foul was atrocious, looked like a straight red to me, but guess referee pressure worked well."
"What do they even expect? ""Oh shit you're right I award Real 2 complementary goals"""
He made a pretty bad foul. I haven't gone back to look at it though to see how bad it really was.
Sure. We both score an own goal and forefit the game
"At the same time, I wouldn't be surprised. Not even a bit xD."
It *will* be a disgrace *when* Rudiger *gets* away lightly with this.
"Hard, but there's no harm in trying! As I said, if we win, we celebrate together :)"
"PSG fans in on it because of them complaining about refs after the Benzema no call, wrong decisions happen, get a move on and stop bitching"
Cause Madrid robbed them of two UCL’s
"+their superstars usually join barcelona. Suarez and Coutinho, for example"
"Only one, we were definitely not the better side the first final but yea"
"The poor guy also tried to give Madrid 2 penalties that were ruled out because of offsides.

In normal time, Barca had 4 yellow and Madrid 2 - is that a serious reflection of how the game was?

There is no hate here but it’s evident that the ref enabled Madrid to play wwe style football. 

He should have given more yellow cards during the match than red cards post match."
"The ferran one was definitely a penalty for me, even more than the cubarsi one. Rudiger effectively lifted ferran's leg and knocked him of balance while he had complete possession of the ball, for me that is undebatable.

As for the cubarsi one, I think it's definitely a tough situation which cannot be assessed by the referee so I agree with you there. That instance is more on the VAR to make it clearer, but it was quickly glossed over like it didn't even happen."
Ronaldo got 5 match ban for a very slight push on this exact same ref. Only way Rudiger doesn’t get at least an equally long ban is if they say it’s cause the object didn’t make contact.
I thought both were Stonewall pens too but the replay cams made me doubt it for both. Didn't see enough clips to be sure for either tho.
"Casillas got Pepe off the pitch then. By telling him that was out of order in a Madrid shirt. 

It doesn’t look like anyone had control over the sideline. Nor respect of the squad this time. Not the captain nor the manager. Dressing room must have issues."
Was that the scythe on opponents back moment? Iconic
"I'm not defending him lol. He absolutely deserves it and Rudiger season should be over and if the club had any balls would be out for the CWC too. 


All I was pointing out was that it didn't look like Vini threw anything, just that he was throwing his arm out while entering the pitch and then mothed out so a deserved red and a suspension in the leauge for multiple games probably"
Hey maybe Ancelotti is gone before that game happens.
Really? I thought he was our best player. Vini and Rodrygo were terrible but Jude has a great game.
There are other subs if you want to talk about that if you want to
it's *Fotze* if you want to know the actual word.
*Missgeburt
That means shots. Switch the i and e
It’s funny how easy it is to act like that from 50 yards away. Just a performative prick
"Honestly I've always felt that him saying ""I'm a crazy guy"" over and over has been a tactic to smooth over acting like a bully. More than mentally unwell or hyper, the word I want to describe him with is bully. He seems to enjoy dirty tackles, tried to humiliate a Japanese attacker when the whole world is watching, makes no attempt to avoid stepping on miles Lewis skellys chest/groin , the whole thing with the staff at madrid and what we all saw yesterday."
What are you talking about? If you’re asking to be held back you’re consciously aware that you’re lunging forward = actively choosing. 
Was hat er gesagt?
Imagine conte or Jose managing him lol
Gotta be a little more specific lol
"Probably more than that, cussed him out or accused him of bias."
A joke between friends
"It's the bluenose in him, so he obviously has to be an unlikeable wanker lmao."
Glad he didn’t get the red. We needed him on the pitch to deliver that assist to Kounde.
i'll never forget the cancelled red to courtois either. absolute clown show that was
You just reminded me of Ramos on a saturday night. Not fair
"Nah we were definitely the worse side in the first final. 

That last final however will probably haunt my dreams for the rest of my life."
"Cmon as much as we can hate them I don’t think we can say they robbed us, it was our own bad performances in the finals that cost us, Karius and Keita like come on. That said ya, getting knocked out by them 4 times in 6 years hurt a lot"
"Any other examples? More Liverpool players join Madrid iirc, Alonso, Owen, MacManaman, Arbeloa, Trent (🥲)"
"Also, how he felt hell-bent on going after the referee. Not sure what'll happen if people on the bench didn't stop him. That must... add something right?"
We are definitely missing a quality captain. Ramos would have kicked rudiger out of there
Feels cosy to blame the coach at the time but I doubt that would change anything for next Classico
"Yes, you're right"
"You don’t dictate what and where i talk about 
As long as i am being civil and not breaking the rules"
"It’s an open forum mate, we can talk about whatever we want. If you don’t want to engage you can simply scroll on past."
ain’t that the guy who scored the winning goal in the 2014 world cup final?
I know lol just thought it was funny
"lol, ja das andere ergibt auch wenig sinn. danke."
"Consciously aware is not the same as actively choosing. People who are hot heads and can freak out easily don't really have a handle on things do they. If anything he was passively choosing,  but psychologists instead call something like that an ""impulse"""
"Hurensohn, etc."
Lol lmao even
"Karius was concussed by a Madrid cynical foul. Salah was knocked out by Ramos in the first half. I’m totally comfortable saying it’s an entirely different match without those things, and we would have had every possibility of winning."
true you can but its like going to a gaming convention and trying to talk about agriculture. Its allowed yes but most people would prefer if you didnt. Anyway hope you have a good day!
lol close enough
Pretty sure they mean the guy with the leather jacket from Happy Days.
Well as far as I’m concerned he certainly is a Fotze for that
"no worries, just like spreading knowledge. and by knowledge, I mean how to curse in different languages."
"That’s literally the way people try and justify domestic abuse. 

You are in control of your actions if you’re consciously aware you’re performing them and thus you can stop. I have no sympathy for violent men who try and claim impulse. You’re not a monkey, grow up. "
"BOTH by Ramos. I still believe that without that final, Karius would have gone on to be a commendable keeper. Maybe not world class, but on the level of someone like Kevin Trapp or something."
If I was at a gaming convention and the conversation I was having naturally turned to agriculture I’d have no problem discussing it tbh
"Well judging by the upvotes and down votes you have just seen what the people prefer and I hope you've learned a lesson.

Haha jk, no way in fuck are people gonna learn"
Aaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy
All good (: I’m German btw and nobody really uses “Fótze” in a conversation haha

I love his style risky but entertaining.
"He also was co-manager when germany won the WC in 2014, and apparently it was his suggestion to bring in Goetze"
Maybe another in him this season?
"Allegedly, he was the one who decided to sub in Mario Gotze in the 2014 World Cup final."
Hansi Flick has literally changed my life
If he wins the treble again. He's up there
Let’s make it 8/8
"From fucking messi in 2014 , to humiliating us with 8-2 , this is the best fucking love story ever bro , Man I Love Flick"
Man has a better finals record than Michael Jordan. insane!!!
Imagine winning two trebles in your first two seasons in two different clubs
The Chosen One
Man I love Flick!
No one not named Guardiola has won 2 trebles. He would easily be a top 5 manager of all time if he does it despite his short career
He is like Thanos but instead of infinity stones he collects silverware.
May he never manage Germany
What a fucking man he is
Flicky boy! We need two more this season
He’s just successful overall in club-level. Finals are just a part of it
Someone remind me why Bayern threw him out the window again?
"most impressive ""style"" change while keeping the Barca philosophy since Pep"
Send him to Benfica.
Flick and Slot running laps around everyone this season
He could genuinely kill one of my family members and I would forgive him
Excellent manager and so much more likeable than Pep. If he moves to City or PSG i might finally drink some bleach.
Kinda wonder what excuses will neutrals use to ignore how great this team is
We should send him to Benfica for science
It has to be 8 right? Didn't he win the sextuple with bayern? And two with Barcelona already?
"NBD. I've won all the finals I've managed in, too. Hansi Flick is doing as well as 99.9999% of the population."
Not overly impressive with Bayern
"Risky but entertaining sits very well with Barcelona fans. If he stays true to this, he could have a long future at the club."
"No kidding, I've lost half my lifespan this season from all the offside shenanigans"
Gotta risk it for the busquets
"And behind the entertaining part is, I think, how Flick instill some serious sense of discipline and motivation to win from what I heard.

Iirc, no one following Barca really questions Flick's hiring, despite the fact just few months ago he lost the dressing room with Germany and his football philosophy is not quite La Masian. Ah, and also he does not speak Spanish.

But hey, look at where we are at. ""German efficiency""?"
so just postecoglu with better players?
"Suggestion? He was talking to him right before he went in and shoved him to the pitch. He used to be like Messi fandom's biggest op between the WC and the 8-1 loss. Now we love him, funny how life goes."
Insane lore
The bastard
He definitely has a knack for those big moments 
Hansi Flick is HIM
If I remember correctly his job was more on the tactical side while Löw was more responsible for man management.
This guy fucking sucks
I think he’s planning 2 more then retiring
"Someone dug up the clip too

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MQxnebTZ3iU"
He is redeeming himself from robbing Messis 1st WC.
Flick: I'm just a coach of a football team
"Oh my god yes I love Flick, I would die for Hansi Flick. His style is going to change my life and he's going to be the best coach ever."
Made me love Bayern again. Then Tucheliban happened
https://i.imgur.com/58So6Sh.png
"Not just up there, he's above all."
Damn I Love Flick
"Winning one treble is ridiculously difficult, let alone 2"
Specifically for Barcelona?
He said managing Germany left him emotionally drained (there are rumours he fell out with the German FA though Hans never talked about it himself) so we are not gonna get that for a long time
Yeah because they did so much better without him. That NT looks cooked for the foreseeable future.
him and then Nagelsmann..
"He left. To manage the German NT. But internal politics were definitely a triggering cause for him to leave. 

Hansi Flick had a fallout with our sporting director Brazzo during that time because he was forced to play players which he wasn't consulted on, like Sane. You might be angry for Flick hearing this but he really had a bad talent ID at that time, asking for players like Timo Werner, Kai Havertz, Renato Sanches. Brazzo's talent ID wasn't particularly spectacular as well, but there should have been civil discussions in their offices regarding transfer strategies. There are more things to add to this context, but this tells enough in a nutshell. In the end, it was bound to fail with how the things went.

Nobody threw him out of here."
The higher ups at Bayern are about 10 years past their best 'use by' date
He decided to leave.
Bayern being Bayern. Drama with the national team
"He just left. The fallout with the board, etc. is just mostly PR I believe. The NT was his dream job."
"Which Neutrals ignore how great Barca is this season? Goddamn, some of you guys are so tiring with your weird victim mentality"
"Bro u just won a cup, your going to win the league and have a shot at cl. Go touch grass and enjoy the win... Goddamn why you shitting yourself over some TV idiots"
“It’s only a matter time before Flicks high line gets exposed” been hearing that all seasono long
take the win and stfu . nobody is underestimating barca
Bayern’s league title isn’t a “final”
"Right, right. Count the trebles and get back here"
"Not really. With modern football, one disappointing season and there's a mob by the door asking to kill the beast. And a disappointing season could be defined by a few key injuries (cit....\*\*cough\*\* \*\*cough\*\*)"
I don’t think he wants a long career. There’s already rumors that this will be his last job and he only wants to renew for 2/3 years
He's already said he's not interested in staying long term so I doubt it'll be more than 3 or 4 years.
This is his last coaching job and he wants to take it year by year. He’s 60 now and has stated he wants to spend time with his grandchildren.
Flick wanna retire soon so I think he will only manage  like 2 more seasons
"Sadly not happening, he said 3 years max"
"> He was talking to him right before he went in and shoved him to the pitch

[I went and dug up the clip for the nostalgia.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQxnebTZ3iU)"
My fellow luka glazer pls tell me you’re not a Barca fan
"insert image from Paulie from the Sopranos

how much betrayal can I take?"
"Ngl 2022 was much sweeter, besides Argies would have lost on penalties for sure. Hansi is a force of greater good, except 8-2 fuck that !"
"Is that you, Sean Bean?"
Whats the status liga how many games before its official
Robbing is not the right word here😭🙏they won fairly
man did some damage to Messi’s career ngl
Manager I'd Like to Fuck? 😂
That's getting carried away.
"I can’t believe we let the world know of anulo mufa, what have we done?"
"He already won a treble with Bayern, this would be his second one"
It is also completely different managing national teams compared to club sides. For instance amount of time he gets with players.
I feel like the narrative would’ve been different if the German players finished their chances better that World Cup. They weren’t as bad in 2022 compared to 2018 imo they created a lot of chances in 2022. Also Spain having such a huge advantage in GD from that one Costa Rica game fucked them over.
What? They were easily the second best team in the Euros and have a fantastic coach
"Flick had the second lowest points per game ratio of all German managers ... Germany was absolutely atrocious with him at the helm, we are worlds apart from that now."
"Christ man watch pundits please, and also he probably means the hansi is overrated german media too"
Mainly psg fans and alot of PL fans
Exactly. Aren't Barca being considered the best team in Europe by most people this season?
Same in Bayern's treble/sextuple season
"I've counted. They bear no relevance to the stat.

In the majority of finals his team are heavy favorite. It's not incredible."
"Literally, look at ancelotti. Won the champions league, la liga, Copa literally last season. And now RM fans all calling for his head."
I have yet to see a single City supporter asking for Pep to be sacked
"Pretty sure he straight up came out and said this. And I can't blame him, dude won a sextuple, was the assistant at a WC win, and is now doing wonders with Barca. What else is there even for him to win? I believe he said he just wants to retire and spend time with his family now that he's over 60."
"Ah yes, PTSD"
"I'm mavs fan and Luka glazers, can't believe I'm saying this but him getting traded has felt worse than Messi leaving"
"Indeed I am. To be honest I don't care much about the basketball side of Spanish clubs. I supported other teams when I used to watch the Euroleague, so I don't have as much hate for Real Madrid BC."
Idk man that foul by Neuer though….
Man I love Flick
He's literally the only other one apart from pep to win the sextuple. If he wins the treble here he definitely warrants goat conversation.
He'd definitely be in the conversation 
"The narrative would‘ve been different without that ridiculous geese presentation they filmed for the Amazon documentary. That shit was the last nail in the coffin for his reputation, at least here in Germany."
"Exactly, people act like his Germany was a disaster. His team played bad for 30 mins against Japan, those 30 mins proved to be enough for them to get knocked out."
"Best in groups, got easily cleared by Spain when it mattered (despite the disgusting refereeing). Second best in what fucking world when France and England exist ?"
"Pundits always wish for our offside trap to fail, it’s funny."
you mean the clowns on espc fc claiming hi line?
Pundits what? Barca is literally the favourite to win CL.
They did not win the CdR last season
most RM fans are people that don't even watch football
Yep. Football fans have short-term memories. Grass is always greener mentality
"Ancelotti won all those trophies playing terrorball, most honest Real Madrid fans haven’t been happy with the football on display for a while now. With Barca fans it’s different, look at what happened with Xavi, people weren’t mad with him because of the results, they were mad because he stopped playing the entertaining style he showed in his first season and went into the 1-0 grind out results mindset that then deteriorated into losses when he had no ball winning CDM and Cancelo who was a disaster defensively."
Fergie would get sacked after 3 seasons in this era. Shame we can’t let talented managers work their magic.
Thats because he plays shit football. Even when he won CLs it was all based on 'black magic'.
RM did a double. Not treble
"Because city fans have seen what’s it like without him, pep has led city to the greatest moments in the club history meanwhile RM have had historical managers, and glory hunter fans"
He is over 60?! Fuck me he is looking good then
"Messi leaving after giving everything he had, luka leaves while he have something to give and against his wishes too"
Acting Like germany was robbing anything in 2014 is Crazy lol 
"Let’s not forget the foul against Kramer. Garay got away scott free, but it was red card worthy."
Foul????? A goalie is allowed to be first to the ball
Both. Both is good.
Both. Both is good.
This is wild man absolutely noone will ever consider flick the goat manager
"I guess it depends on things you value and such but Pep Vs SAF is the battle for me with great cases to be made for both.

Like the sextuple isn't a real or meaningful thing to me, super cup type comps have no meaning at all to me, just a glorified friendly, the League, Europe and the top domestic cup hold true weight.

If Flick does the treble he's maybe in the top 10 conversation but it's a tough group to crack."
"I mean, they WERE bad. Thing is: they were bad before under the post-WC Löw era, and even after Flick and some games into Nagelsmann. This was not really a coach issue.

Was Flick the wrong choice for NT manager? Yes. Is Flick a bad coach like some media made him? Absolutely not, that was emberassing journalism talking about the man that took over a Bayern in shambles mid season and then turned them into beasts destroying all competition. And he only got bad rep after that because of Brazzo.

Happy for him at Barca, he is a great coach and the season proves it."
"Revisionism at it's finest

the team looked **terrible** coming into that WC"
I must be living in a different reality because France and England both looked awful during the Euros.
"> easily cleared by Spain when it mattered

Easily cleared is when you win in the 120th minute apparently 

> when France and England exist

Did you actually watch the tournament or did you just look at the bracket? France and England were very poor for their standards"
"I remember the case being the same during Bayern's 2020 CL run. Even after beating Barca 8-2, pundits wouldn't shut up about the high line"
Pundits like every big football pundit in epsn cbs have all said inter are favorites because barca have a shite defense even though both todays goals were set pieces
But they tried
Same with Barca tho
most RM fans are what? lol
"At least they’re elegant, respectful and classy unlike Barca fans tho"
"Real and Barca fans are*

Fans of other clubs often have more patience."
But Madrid fans ever cared about good football? Zidane also played terrorball plus ball to Ronaldo score and won the triple Champions and they were fine 
I prefer calling it inshallah football myself
Xavi won a trophy thanks to the 1-0 grind it out wins lol
"Well, he turned 60 two months ago."
If anything it's fucking Higuain and Palacios that robbed Messi.
I don’t think it was robbed. All I’m saying is that foul by Neuer though… In todays game that goes to a VAR check.
There was also the butchering of Schweinsteiger.
"Does no one remember it was a knee to Higuain’s head?? Lol stop trying to make it seem like it was light foul or just a common play. 

It was a 50/50 call that could’ve gone either way and I think in this day and age it might go to VAR for reckless play."
A treble with this Barca side would arguably elevate Flick’s treble above that won by AF or PG.
">Easily cleared is when you win in the 120th minute apparently

and not giving germany the clearest penalty of all time in overtime"
it's really that scottish (?) guy . he really gets supremely annoying saying the same shit over and over. for what 8 months now?
To be fair Real Madrid hasnt exactly been threatening in open play recently. They can barely score goals
"Well, this Madrid team opened you up quite a few times and in the second half, your defense was trembling at times. Also, weren't many Barca fans on this sub crying about Flick's defensive tactics and the excessive high line just this season?"
hey you dropped the /s but I picked it up for you
Bitch what?
Source? RMTV?
Lmao nice joke
Just like Toni Rüdiger!
lol what ?!?!
That's exactly his point?
Naah the times they opened up were few and far between where they werent covered or offside
Nobody was mad at Xavi that season when we were grinding out the 1-0 wins?? So I’m not sure what the point is? They got mad at Xavi because we went on a losing streak the ~next~ season and Xavi never could make in game adjustments and we were losing all our leads because we decided to sit back after any goal we scored and had a bunch of remontadas against us. That’s when everyone got pissed at him.. I guess we’re remembering different seasons
Madrid were the better side in the second half for the most part. And your defence did seem to panic when Madrid started growing into the game. It's not an infallible defense. Inter could exploit it if Barca don't convert their chances. I'm glad that they won though.
"Definitely remembering different seasons. People were pissed Barcelona was playing defensive long balls, and terms like ""resultadismo"" and ""unocerismo"" came from. Threads like this one https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/bnF2ZD2Ayb
Also reflect the views I'm talking about. Xavi saying Barcelona has to accept it can't compete after losing was the nail in the coffin, but his pragmatic style was absolutely criticized"
They were better until the second goal after which they dropped off imo
I’m sorry I skimmed through the first 7-8 threads - where do you see the criticism?
Which was in the 77th minute? So Madrid were better for the most part in that half.

incoming one game ban for Rudiger.
Rudiger is fucked in the head.
"Should receive a long ban for his antics, has embarrassed himself all season really. But we know it will max be 3 games, likely 1."
"Look at everyone jumping on Rüdiger to control him but they just let Vini walk by them despite his ""hold me back"" energy. I think the Real Madrid players and staff know very well who the actual unhinged lunatic and the one just being theatrical is."
How carlo is standing there is astonishing
At what point will the referees refuse to cover Real Madrid games. I'd be having second thoughts putting up with the abuse.
Ice ice baby
The most successful club in Europe are the sorest  losers
Imagine doing this or having this kind of behavior in a “regular” workplace.
"They need like 5 or 6 players banned for their performance in this game. They won't learn unless something happens and the level of privilege and exceptionalism is getting completely out of hand.

So glad Arsenal turned them over in the CL."
"The way Madrid are acting I hope Barcelona beat them to the title for the next decade. This current squad are absolutely horrible. I’ve seen children act better than this lot. 

When do referees say the abuse is enough and just boycott their games?"
This man is extremely sick and a danger to everyone around him.
"Ref report : "" Rudigar was just giving me ice water bottle because I was thisrty..."""
its actually painful and annoying how disliked the current madrid squad is and how much controversy there is with them
"Biggest bunch of degenerates to ever wear that jersey, huh?"
"Man, the f’cker had mad eyes. I mean, he has been weird, abusive and violent in the past, but last night Rudiger just took “crazy eyes” to another level.

Should get a 3-5 games ban, you can’t simply attack the referee like that just because things aren’t going your way. Actually, you shouldn’t assault game officials. Period."
"Rudiget is such a maaaassive piece of shit it’s insane, if he wasn’t a football player he’d probably be in jail the little scum bag"
This should be a multi year ban honestly. Players have the right to criticise a ref but trying to assault the ref is disgusting and brings the integrity of the game into question. If they let this slide then they’re effectively setting a precedent that refs can be bullied and intimidated and assaulted if players disagree with them. I hope they clamp down on it hard so these multi-millionaire clowns stop acting like petulant little brats.
"When he made the cut throat gesture with the crazy ass eyes to Atleti supporters most people thought it was not a big deal and downvotes for hundreds if you said otherwise. The man is crazy, this is just another one"
Scum bags acting like scum bags throwing ice bags.
"He didn’t try, he did do it. 

This clip shows him getting the red for throwing the bag of ice."
"This was one of the craziest things I've ever seen on a football pitch. That closeup shot of him genuinely terrified me.

Please get this goon out of my club and sign Huijsen, I don't care if the defence suffers in the short term. I genuinely don't want to see this guy play for us again."
Didn't think Turan throwing his boot at the linesman and then asking for it back would be topped yet here we are
"""When you can't win with your feet, you try with your mouth."" In this case with an ice bag lol"
"He’s a fucking danger to everyone around him, should never be allowed on a football pitch."
"As a German I dont want him to play for our country anymore. 
The German Football Assosiation preaches equality and respect. Yet Rüdiger is a Salafist, throws Objects at people and calling them some of the strongest swear words in German Language in Front of all the viewers. 

Beeing a good defender should not allow him to be violent and disrespectfull."
"Come on guys, it clearly just [slipped out of his hand](https://youtu.be/l_F0h-6MaV8?si=nhnxrA_bFjn1CMSV)"
this is so embarrassing for him
Great player but bad person. Same with Vinicius. They are really unlikeable.
This guy is one piece of shit.
Don’t tell me the Real Madrid kit man/staff member he slapped in the face non jokingly is among the ones having to contain him 🙏
"Grown men btw

Embarrassing"
Embarrassing
clown player
"So he should be banned heavily. Real Madrid are such an entitled team and when things don't go their way they accuse and throw tantrums. 

I'm glad Barca are dominating them."
Did he try to bite that staff member's arm??
"He's probably getting a 3-4 match ban max that means nothing, he was doing it knowing he's injured.

This was an ACTUAL crash out but Perez is not guilt free here. This ""Everybody is against us, 1 vs world mentally bullshit"" is doing the opposite effect on the players.

You can influence the referees all you want, the players have to go and win a professional football match."
He's a piece of shit
He seems unhinged. Like in a mental health way.
"Why aren't you laughing now, you psycho?"
"makes you wonder what these madrid dogs are like behind closed doors when things don't go their way.

absolute scumbags, hopefully they don't win a pot this year and for the years to come."
Ice ice baby
This team is fucked
Street thug mentality.
How embarrassing...
Insane behavior
"That reaction by him was completely unnecessary, i agree it was a final and everyone from Madrid where pretty pumped up but the reaction was overdone. 
 If he had put that much passion in defending barca would have found it hard to score those goals, maybe the fact that he was directly responsible for 2nd goal made him do it."
Rudiger is a psychopath.
I really wonder if no one had stopped him really what was the plan? Assaulting the ref?
If this doesn’t result in a 6 months plus ban then this will set a really bad precedent in regards to referee’s safety
What a fucking dickhead he is
Hes always been like this.
Very mature
Has the look of a man who’d murder someone without a second thought
"Ice melted, no evidence. I think the only fair thing is for the referee to offer a full apology to Madrid."
Bro just wants to be an X-Man
"I know they can give him a 12-match ban, and I hope they use it, this behaviour gets you arrested outside of the football pitch."
The game is back
Ideal role model for the kids.  🤦‍♂️
Dobar mumin
"Rudiger, Vasquez and Bellingham deserves to be banned for the rest of the season. And I dont understand how Vini didnt get a red either."
Well this is nothing short of an embarrassment
It should be dealt with as if he wasn't held back and he had followed through with the implied action. Punish the intent.
Surely Everton can't get away with this
what a psycho. bans him form the sport
"He also heavily insulted the referee in German, called him ""Hurensohn"" und ""Missgeburt"".

Pathetic player in a pathetic team."
That man is a big news story waiting to happen.
"That, and Vini walking onto the pitch mid game???"
Smart. When they try to find the evidence of attack on the ref it would’ve melted
Someone could just tell him it’s just a game
Real fans still try to blame the ref
"Gives every impression of being an utter bellend, which at least means he's playing for the right team."
Should start charging them with assault and battery for this behaviour.
Rüdiger is not a fully developed adult.
They should relegate Real Madrid for a season or two to cool down...
"What a piece of shit, feel bad for his family."
"Seeing these replays. It annoys me a lot that Ancelotti just stands in there. Your team, your players - dame them and put them in place."
"Enjoy the circus, Trent"
And trent u wanna go to that?
This guy acts like a freaking chimpanzee
That's embarrassing from Ancelotti tbh
The only thing that could elevate this shithousery? Mourinho.
I guess we are all hating Madrid today? For the same thing again and again. Mods really can’t be more pro Barca.
Remember when Lewandowski got 3 games ban for poking his nose?
You know the drill 😉 💰
It’s his choice now: 25 years jail time or a €150 fine
Did you see him touch his nose? Then it would be 3. 1 will suffice
"One game ban AND only for CDR so he'll not play CDR game against some 4th tier club next season, what a punishment."
"One game ban? Your being to harsh, watch Rudiger apologize and all is forgotten. Matter of fact probably give 2 penalties to Madrid in the next game."
"Yeah, he seems to have genuine psychological issues."
"I said it before and I will say it again. He is a thug and a bully with football skills. If he didn't know how to play football, he'd probably be in an out of prison."
He's just quirky /s
"He interrupted Ancelottis motivational team talk yesterday by growling loud lmfao.

Ancelotti turned around and looked scared."
"If a member of the audience did this they would surely receive a life time ban, such a poor example to set"
"The last time Vinicius needed a hold me back, the one who stopped him was Rudiger lmao"
"I mean, between the two of them you'd want to stop the bigger guy who's been known to slap colleagues and is currently grabbing bags of ice instead of the guy who just kinda yells."
He cbf as he’s leaving at the end of the season.
He deserves to be in a less toxic environment
*Rice Rice Baby
"Boss: ""Sorry, Garlic Cheese Chips, you can't have the last Sunday of the month off.""

Me: ""Where's the ice? Where's the FUCKING ice?!"""
You'd be handed your termination letter immediately and security would escort you out.  As it should be.
Damn imagine slide tacking someone in your workplace or imagine doing the SUIIIII celebration after completing a task at work lol. Not really comparable
"Any league with any self respect would have MAJORLY punished a club for acting like Real Madrid has had.  We may even complain about it, but when players complain about refs post-match, regardless of league or sport, it’s almost always met with that player being punished.  And yet we have Real Madrid as a whole acting like this.  If the Spanish footballing authorities have any balls, they severely punish them.  I’m wholly convinced if Man City, Man United, Liverpool, or Arsenal acted exactly like this, the English FA would be slapping down major punishments for players and clubs."
It is the heritage of Real Madrid to act like spoilt brats. There’s this weird expectation everyone is supposed to bow down to them it’s so odd
"Tryna to attack the ref should be more than 3-5 games, if they let him be who knows what he would have done"
3-5 games what!??? Trolling!??? On Premier league this guy would be out for 1 year... in a serious league ofc!
The root of all this is florentino
He’s a lunatic. And he puts in a solid defensive performance pretty frequently but it can’t be worth having someone who’s this much of a liability on the team.
Where's this quote from? Suarez?
He called the ref a misscariage right?
"Vini seems like a pretty good guy off the field. His bitching on the field is very annoying and I think generally people have reason to dislike him, but off the field I’ve never heard much bad said about him."
This isn't shithousery. He's fucked in the head.
"gotta say, real don‘t exactly make it hard to hate them, especially in the past few days lol"
"Pro Barca by pointing out Real players scummy behaviour?

Your comment sums up all that is wrong with Reals manufactured victim complex."
Can't believe the r/soccer mods made Rüdiger try to assault a ref just to make Real Madrid look bad
Downvote and move on if this bothers you so much.
"2 game ban, he already had 1 game over 2 yellows (not that that makes it any better)"
"Wasn't he making a gesture to suggest the referee was corrupt?

The Mbappe suspension was a joke but I don't think Barca fans are doing themselves favours by making stuff up."
Cdr bans transfer to la liga
"I don't give a fuck what's his diagnosis. 
Refs constantly allowing him to get away with a murder without consequences"
100%. The guy is absolute pond life.
There's still time for him to be in prison though he'll probably be able to pay his way out now
Surely this has nothing to do with his skin color!

"i remember that yea. When Vini was pointing at the racists. The one time i felt respect for Rudiger, he tried to prevent worse for his teammate. But man the shit Rudiger has pulled over the years makes him the worst likeable player in European fields now that ex Getafe guy moved back to South America (Damian Suarez, uggh)."
The dog that barks doesn't bite saying 
I really wish he leathered it into the players in the dressing room though. That was a humiliating way to be defeated.
He's a manager. His responsibility is to reprimand this behavior and improve the team culture.
">He deserves to be in a less toxic environment

No. He enables this petulance. He isn't any better than the pricks he manages."
Talking about toxic environment.....Cut to he's at the Brazilian National Team 😅
It’s his responsibility to cultivate the environment?
Those free kicks took Madrid over the edge.
"I work in the post office, and there pretty much only a few ways you could do something, and management firing you will actually stick.  Stealing mail, and violence/openly threatening violence is two of those things that will actually get one chucked."
"Imagine 50,000 people cheering after you send an email to Barbara from HR"
Idk I’ve had some shitty tasks added to my sprint last minute that have felt like slide tackles.
"Slide tackles are part of the game, anyone who plays football accepts the risk of that happening.

This is not."
"Now i'm reminded of those 00s ""Terry Tate: Office Linebacker"" videos."
Who said anything about their behaviour not being scummy? I just said the same video is being posted again and again and again. What’s the point?
"Also they appealed the ban in time to let him play their next match against Espanyol, even though he shouldn't have played because he had gotten the 2 yellows for something unrelated to the gesture"
"Deserved tbh. Ref was really shit that game but you’re just playing with fire doing that.

Rudiger’s is way more insane (10x worse than indicating that the ref is on coke) and I still think Mbappe’s was very dangerous"
"> I don't think Barca fans are doing themselves favours by making stuff up.

Oh we are. You're just fucking clueless about the RM favoritism in Spain lmao"
Hahahahahahahahahahahhahaha
It didn't until you made it
You forgot to mention his religion too. He also grew up in Berlin because everyone there is either a leftist hippie or a criminal
"Surely a ban for rudiger has to be as harsh as that one was, you can't assault the officials, do players still receive wages under a match ban? I would imagine not"
"Sure it was the same shite with Pepe and Ramos. Warrior mentality=/= brutality and lack of professionalism. Jesus the best defenders of all time weren't like this. Maldini, Canovaro, Beckenbauer etc. Real knows they can get away with this. The official body did well with reds last night but Real were rough throughout."
And Rudiger is seen trying to bite the staff member's arm lmao
He clearly failed to improve the team culture and behavior but he was never a manager to encourage this kind of attitude when looking at his pas tenures
I’m not saying he shouldn’t take responsibility but it isn’t in his nature that the past teams he managed didn’t behave like that.
Don’t think you’re getting my point
"You think the point is this sub being 'pro Barca'.

Calma.

Videos often come up multiple times."
Close Reddit then. Nobody is making you look.
"This sub will post the same thing from different angles all the time lol. Goals, fouls, saves, etc. But today it’s reposts of a Madrid player losing his absolute mind so now there must be some pro Barca conspiracy happening behind the scenes."
"I agree. Both are way worse than Lewandowski and need much longer bans.

But that doesn't mean he shouldn't have been banned and saying he was banned for 'touching his nose' is disingenuous. It doesn't help the cause when talking about actual injustices like the Mbappe one."
"I didn't see the whole game, but the second yellow was well deserved then."
There's the discourse and insight i expect from this sub.
I have literally never seen this comment about any white players and there are far more psychotic players than rudiger but sure go ahead
"I never forgave Pepe for That moment in 2009. Don’t care he’s had a long career, he crossed lines there. Rudiger is so far gone there are no lines anymore to him."
Cannavaro was quite the dirty player. Never seen Beckenbauer play
He managed Gattuso and you're telling me he doesn't have experience with players who behave poorly?
"Yeah, saying ref is doing coke is too much slander imo. Just say bad ref but coke? Come on"
Seen this about Joey Barton more than once.
Lol what? Where were you when Suarez was playing t-rex out there?
"> far more psychotic players 

Name one, and we'll consider how they are treated"
Now that was assault. Jesus Real really get horrible whingebags for players
"Beckenbaur surely had his dirty moments as did Canovaro but I've never seen pros like the ones in Reals history. Every new iteration of a centre defence pairing has this going on. I know it's not strange in the world of football but the Madrid players go into assault territory.

Edit: It's the lack of professionalism is the worst as a spectator. They don't respect the referees or the opponent. Recently, Carvajal and Saka going down the tunnel, Carvajals hands around his neck . Again, more unprofessionalism. Carlo lost his handle on the squad. A bad year, they happen but they are choosing to sack him now"
"Gattuso was never unsportsmanlike, you can’t compare him with the likes of vini, rüdiger or bellingham"
Yes the guy that has literally been arrested multiple times and assaulted his wife. Rudiger looks mean at players and is sometimes overly aggressive. Thanks for proving my point
"So far i got 2 examples, barton and suarez. They both literally assaulted people. Did arrest worthy stuff. You keep proving my point"
"I dunno why downvotes, Gattuso was hard player, but never noticed he would be dirty behaviour person like these."
I guess being thuggish and being in and out of prison has no skin colour. Humans of all races can be very messed up apparently.
"Nobody is proving any point. You made up an argument out of nowhere and stay to true your username. You brought up skin color, everyone else is speaking about behaviour."
people seem to mix up these 2 things
"That's correct, but rudiger has never assaulted anyone. He isn't ""thuggish"" either, just can be hot headed, no more than ramos. No one ever said ramous would be in prison had he not played football. I don't like bringing race into stuff but i can bet my house this guy wouldn't say that about rudiger if he were white"
"I mean I've seen the ""anywhere else, that's assault and he should be in jail"" rhetoric for Ramos quite a few times regarding that Salah challenge. He was equally thuggish, and as a Barca fan, even more of a villain. Besides, chucking something at someone's head in frustration and anger could very well be considered assault, but that's beside the point."
Rudiger literally assaulted a Real Madrid staff member not too long ago
"You're literally arguing to lower our standards for violent conduct because of his skin colour, which is some real 'bigotry of low expectations' shit"
"**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**
  

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
Rudiger should go to time out
Will his suspension count for laliga?
He might have to do a Michael Jordan and play some baseball for a season. Probs would actually be decent as well.
Never seen anything like it. Was there any other instance at such a big stage when a player at team lashes out against his own teammate like this?
Vini and Vasquez in sync looks oddly satisfying
"I've always joked rudiger is crazy, but he's fully lost the plot here"
Rudiger with the’  hold me back bro’. Pathetic. All for show. You can get past that guy as easily as you want.
"This team is so unlikeable, they get more pathetic every hour it seems"
"I have to say, I'll give Mbappe some credit for not participating in or encouraging this clownery"
Idk if I've seen a better reflection of a club by its players than this
"Maybe Carlo is too old to control these guys, just look at him standing there, lethargically..."
Pathetic losers the lot of them
"Rudiger needs counselling. Like serious counselling, a grown man should not act like this at any circumstance."
Stepping into the field is mad
Weak entitled bitch club. Come to this club to harass and doxx refs and then still have the audacity to blame anyone but yourself for losing A GAME
He would have assaulted the ref
I’m high on the schadenfreude and crash out
Seriously man. What disgraceful behavior. These players are ruining the image of Real Madrid. 
Can anyone confirm if one of the 3 red cards was for Jude or was it for Vini?
"Trent, is this what you want?"
"the club... the history.. the fans... they all reflect each other lmao, Franco would be so proud"
"Rudiger also yelled the words Missgeburt and Hurensohn at the referee, which in German mean miscarrage and son of a whore."
"We'll see what the match report says. ""Rudiger's ice pack slipped from his hand while he was trying to adjust it"", perhaps?"
Where was that enthusiasm on the pitch 😂
"This is still insane I saw it in real time. Even crazier with clear audio with quiet commentators, you can hear him screaming his head off. Even Mendy is holding him back and he went off injured after 5 minutes"
What a fucking disgrace
fuck this team
Vini and Lucas air punching in sync at 1:03 is so satisfying to watch
Embarrassing man
Will probably get 1 game and the ref will get reprimanded
Can't wait for Rio Ferdinand to go on and on about how classy they are next time he is commentating a game of theirs.
An embarrassment
How unusual behavior for Real Madrid. My pearls
Nuclear meltdown is an understatement at this point
"They don't know how to lose, that's why. They think everyone is against them if they lose..."
This brings joy
"Seriously, what the fuck could they possibly be protesting? They get every single call in their favour. The ref was also FOR THEM. Not to them. Absolutely disgraceful behavior and it says so much about the state of the game that absolutely nothing will be done."
Man Rudi has just gotten so much crazier than he already was when he was with us.
Haha bunch of absolute classless cunts.
Ref robbed Barca of 2-3 penalties and allowed Olmo to get slaughtered by Rudiger. And yet he has the audacity to cry foul? Smh
"Love the meltdown 😂.
Not the first time Real Madrid players have done this crap. There is something about being a RM player. Being a bitch."
Is the world finally beginning to understand that Real Madrid are entitled cunts?
Real Madrid has become a joke of a club.. bunch of clowns.
Inject it into my eyes!
"ban him for long time, if not a lot of players will do it in future"
Why the fuck would you want to be a ref in la liga?
"All teams can be annoying, especially bigger ones since they have the spotlight but Madrid this season is exceptionally annoying. Like a whiney, annoying, spoiled man-child."
What a pathetic club that is.
"Grown men who get paid millions,
acting like children because the big bad referee didn’t give a decision in their favour."
Any decent coach would throw these children out of the club.
"What a joke of a club, absolutely no class."
"Fuck Rudiger
It's ridiculous at this point

Man can kill and get away with it"
Fucking hate RM
Petulant fucking children.
Real Madrid have truly shown their true colors. Absolute divas when things don’t go their way.
Throwing something at the referee should be a long suspensions. Fucking entitled brats these Madrid players.
Ancelloti can also be blamed for allowing this crap to happen. He is too soft with his players.
"Rudiger: let me go, I’m just going to kill him a little bit"
The funny part is that the slap from mbappe is clear af
"I have a question, maybe Rudiger is not as strong as he seems, which I don't think is the case, but then who the hell is that assistant holding him and actually moving him back without taking a sweat? didn't know Messi's bodyguard joined the Madrid staff"
Total head loss and it's all a performance. Rudiger isn't going to do a thing if no one's holding him back.
"I remember when Rudiger was a bit psycho but in a good competitive way. The way he pulled random shit to win duels and the ball. He’s in an environment where it’s festered into him becoming a such a violent psycho. If it was a public place and he throws a chunk of ice at someone it would add up as assault. It’s just a red if he’s in a football pitch? Bullshit. He should have been confined immediately. He was allowed to go for round 2! embarrassing. 

He needs to be charged and banned from football and public till a psychiatrist certifies him as safe to be around. This is ridiculous behaviour and should not be tolerated. Needs to set a proper precedence or we’re gonna have players flinging their shit at each other."
The foul call was absolutely terrible but you can not react like that….
Imagine getting so much money for playing a sport and still behaving like little children. Embarrassing
I used to root for Real in these games. I saw the light a while back. Horrible club
"This should get a 1 year ban, but laliga is a joke and real Madrid does as it pleases, so probably the referee will be deported by police or something"
"Its bullshit!! Real Madrid is shit this season, this referee against us saga, is to distract people from their trophyless season"
Idiot playing tough guy.
Utterly pathetic children
What a bunch of cunts
Rudiger is such a fucking cunt. Hope he hangs them up soon so that I never have to see anything about him again.
Rudiger is the definition of a big dumb idiot
Rudiger is a thug and a vastly overrated player.
"The game should have never been played in the first place because of the blatant attempts at influencing the referee and now this shit??

I'd just ban the whole team from copa del rey for a year at this point. Disgraceful."
"1. Rudiger is violent and should be set an example with at least a 5 game ban
2. Vini entered the pitch and should be carded
3. Mbappe kicked the ball after the whistle and should have been carded"
Incredible crashout at such a clear foul lmao
"Dude single handedly setbacked Reals reputation for atleast 5 years. As if the referee thing wasnt bad enough, Rudigers action just showed it wasnt an apparently biased towards opposition referee that the club has issues with"
Shit like this is sickening that Trent wants to be part of it
"Mbappe could have been sent off as well as it aure looks like he is kicking the ball at the official after the call.

Either way, just the petulant action of a childish Real Madrid team with no decorum or professionalism.

They take after Perez so well."
Ancelotti is probably the weakest top manager out there. Can't control his players and doesn't even try to
What a child
Why bother holding him back? He could this is Sparta the ref at the center circle and be available for the next match
"A ref should just stand his ground and let Rudiger either hit him or push him. If Rudiger takes a swing at a ref, his career is over."
embarrassing shitshow WTF how old are they ? come on seriously this is just mad - grown “man” it seems. in reality all big children with an astronomical ego
The Don doing his best pulp fiction impression while all this goes down
"Ancelotti was avoiding the camera, wasn't he?"
Vini and Rudiger are both spoiled babies. Always crying about everything. Christ alive.
"Don't they remember how they started wasting time after they took the lead? We were may be at most only half as bad as them.

It was a slap to the face and will always be called. But, I always hate these calls regardless of the team."
He tried to grab the ice bag to throw that at the ref too! Crazy
Rudiger seriously needs to seek psychological help
"Truly humble in victory and gracious in defeat, embarrassing bunch of entitled divas."
"Disgraceful, absolutely despicable"
What a fucking animal.
"Lfg, finally some heat in an El Clasico. Unfortunately it was only onesided."
Balloon floor contender
Rudiger needs to get a lengthy ban.
Rudiger and Vinicius are a total shitshow.
Rudiger is a tosser. Needs some actual help with anger management
Pathetic club
"Real Madrid, what a disgusting club. Zero class and a culture of bad sportsmanship.

Also Ancelotti is a fantastic coach and manager, but whilst at Madrid he's done nothing to stop this and just looks like he doesn't care when his kids throw their toys out of the pram."
He looks wired
Loser behavior. Specifically Rudiger should really look at himself after that horrible defending like a 5y on the wrong side at the 2-2. If he needs to blame anyone he needs to look a himself. Disgraceful behavior….
Lock rudiger up before he kills someone
Did Vazquez do something else? Feels like Vini did the same thing as him. Or is it just because he stayed on the field longer
Carlo probably can't wait to log off lmfao
first football players to be diagnosed with CTE
Rudiger is an animal. Unable to control his emotions. All this for a free kick.
"Fuck Rudiger and Vinícius , absolute clowns!

If Vini is the best Brazil has to offer currently, no wonder they're so much shit ! He's a fucking man baby and doesn't even come close to Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho or Romário.

Hell I'd say he doesn't even come close to Bebeto! 

I fucking hate that scumbag!"
"Vini and Vasquez 5 matches in La Liga, Rudiger 20 matches"
Put Rudigar in a rehabilitation centre. He needs HELP.
Like a spoiled child whose never been told no in his life
Why didn't Vinicius got a red card?
Suspend them for a good while if you want this to stop
Sad thing is young kids like Guler and Endrick will see this grown ass man bozo clowning about like this and think it's acceptable behaviour
guys dont criticize him or he will play race and religion card. wat a shit bag.
"Real Madrid, the organization, is trying to get a referee killed. Between the pre-match bullshit, this, and whatever they put out after, they are trying to get someone to act violently to him.

Fucking dangerous and absolutely disgraceful."
"Madrid ultimate crash out

Edit - How did Madrid turn out like this? It wasn’t even long ago they had the world in their hand after that remontada against City, all the love and popularity in the world. 

Then things took a sudden turn in the BdOr, or rather the ship’s captain decided to just spin the whole damn wheel around so bad that somehow the ship capsized, making the impossible happen. Isn’t their whole motto like, the gentlemen’s club?"
Clearly its not the full incident if it doesnt show the original foul
"The refereeing was all good tbh. Our recent successes have put a sore loser mindset among the club, the players and the fans. We probably don't deserve to win a trophy this season... I just hope we learn from the failures this season and we mature from it instead of complaining about it till next season"
Ludicrous reaction but that free kick was a terrible decision
Disgusting cunt
What a silly guy 🤭
Fuckin clowns
"This is fucking pathetic.  What an actual pussy. 


Football needs to adopt rules like handball: if your coaches or anyone on the bench gets themselves red carded, then you have to take an on field player off at the same time. 


It would quickly cut down this sort of shite if their teammates were being punished for this ridiculous hard man act. "
This is the return of Mou´s Madrid if you know what I mean
That's just sheer classlessness and arrogance from Real Madrid. Entirely odious and entitled bunch of clowns on the touchline.
He was is and will be an animal
"Dude was in Kill mode.  
  
  
What do you guys think he would do to the reff if Real players didn't hold him back? It could have cost him his whole carrier if he pulled some GTA there

Crazy"
Real Madrid was not going to win the public approval given their drama last few days.  Barca definitely played their ends off!
Guy has the temperament of a 6 year old.
He is and always will be completely insane with major anger issues
Did they both throw something?
u/savevideo
That’s pathetic.
"Such a horrible player.

How he hasnt been banned for a prolonged period of time I'll never know."
A proper NFL caliber throw that was from Rudiger
Any translation on what he said?
"Sore losers!! The controversy they created before the final and the controversy they created after the final suggests they can't take defeats sportingly . I admire their drive ,their spirit and passion to win titles but this is not acceptable."
Eric Garcia passed out by breathing too much air.
Bunch of maniacs 60iq
Sore losers
Garcia is soft like baby shit
"Put him in a psychiatric ward, what did Vasquez do to get a red?"
This is why Real Madrid aren’t liked recently.
It is not his first time and it will not be his last time.
what a bunch of crybabies
Full respect - great throw. If ref hadn’t seen that coming I think it would have hit. Admittedly……awful behaviour and needs a decent ban.
This guy has done psycho shit his entire career. Crazy how long he's kept it up
"In fairness, it was a pretty good throw"
"Bro the players acting like shit. Even Ramos, Pepe had some class"
What a prick !
"Shocking, the team blaming the ref with videos before the match is filled with cry babies"
"Animals, better to not comment anymore"
10 game suspension minimum..that shit should not slide
the religion of love yes sir
I no longer recognize my club :(
I will never understand why people follow this team full of entitled man childs.
Start learning Chinese buddy
Trent is headed to this shit show don’t do it brother
Barca robbed for 2 clear penalties ✅ Real Madrid meltdown because of freekick on the middle of the field ✅
We all missing Mbappe kicking the ball towards the ref?
Agent of peace __
"The decision was ridiculous and the ref was clearly favoring Barça with it


...but for some reason in this sub you can't point out when the ref unfairly favors B, even if it is as obvious as it is when the ref unfairly favors RM. Only the second must be shown and discussed, and the first handwaved.


Anybody normal watching the actual game noticed all the bullshit, and no amount of gaslighting will change what we all saw."
"""Full incident"" but erased the blatant dive and the replay from the full video."
"Great clip, doesn't show Garcia dive or the foul on Brahim not given 3sec earlier. Top tier barca flair post, gotta respect it"
He was clearly trying to provide the ref with some much needed hydration after 2 hours on his feet.
he should get the Draymond Green treatment of getting suspended indefinitely
The naughty step...
Real always have a Pepe. That this behaviour no matter what happens on the field is an embarrassment to the club and one more reason to dislike them.
"Dani Benitez was suspended 3 months for throwing something at a referee.

That’s the standard set for Rudiger. Anything less than 3 months and it’s simply not being held to a prior standard."
"After the Mbappe suspension, do you really expect anything significant?"
nah he'll get a 1 match ban just like when mbappe tried to murder someone
"If it's more than a 3 game ban, I believe it goes across tournaments."
Co-ask for a friend of a friend
Which suspension?
Anulo mufa 🙏
Context for Micheal Jordan?
Do not give this man a bat
"Ramos in the 2010 5-0 el clasico went ballistic at the end too.

Man lashed out like a child and got sent off as well. People often overlook his Antics too, but he was also a cunt"
I have zero doubt Madrid is trying to get the ref killed.
"Did he lashed out against a teammate? I thought he was wanting to go against the ref. I didn't understamd the whole situation. Something came up and couldn't watch the match, so i got no context"
The only thing that comes to mind is Lee Bowyer and Kieran Dyer but that was on nowhere near as big a stage
Hahaha yeah looks like a FIFA animation
"In Polish, we say that someone's train had left if they go nuts. 

In this case, the whole station left without Rudiger."
"Part of me wishes they just let him go. Like wtf you gonna do, punch a ref and never play a professional game again? Or get in his face, get suspended for the rest of the season, retire in disgrace and never play a professional game again?"
This is testing the waters of hold me back.  He clutched at the second ice pack and was wrestling against a staffer jostling for control before the others corralled him.
"Not true, look at the size of him. He's not all talk no fight like someone like Emiliano Martinez or Luis Suarez."
They have been unlikable for years masked by winning a couple of CLs when they were clearly outplayed and pulled it out of their ass. Bunch of cunts
Always have been.
They could win every trophy next season but they’ll still be a sad sad club. Whole club feels sterile and weird. I don’t even support any club but the only club which feels this way is Madrid.
With Kroos every single shred of class has left the team.
im glad people are finally seeing these scumbags for who they really are. Hated them since they pulled la decima out of their ass.
"He's way too rich to care for any of this shit I guess. Also, he lost his drive after that final loss in WC."
"Pepe, ramos, case"
"No manager can engage with that....

A lot of embarrassing things done by the club in last few months and To think this might be Carlo's last club season... He's embarrassed a bit i think...."
Which coach would be able to stop rudiger when he is like that? Guy is absolutely unhinged
"I said this last time but there is only one man who can manage players as egotistic and arrogant as these players are, Jose Mourinho.

Edit: You guys are right. Conte seems like a better choice."
The guy is out of his mind he might hit anyone
"Yeah, Carlo is leaving at the end of season."
Sleepy old Carlo /s
"Or he's the one fuelling it, allowing it"
"Carlo out...

...Zizou in"
"Their culture is in absolute shambles right now, a bunch of divas with no grit or self control. They need grounded leadership on the field."
"I mean its the cup final, and its a classico. Its the dying moments of extra time, past midnight local time.

How can a grown adult not think in this situation ""hmm theres a lot of cameras pointed all over the place, maybe i should behave"". 

The man is genuinely out here acting like that 'specific' call from the ref was the most *insulting* & *offensive* thing the ref could possibly do. 

Therapy should be a minimum."
"And it’s over a simple foul too. Not a penalty or a red card. A simple free kick. Like the commentators said, they had 120+ minutes to win the game and this cunt was shit for most of it and is acting like a lunatic over one foul. Perfect representative of Real Madrid."
"Funnily enough Rudiger didn’t do that, it was Vini and Vasquez? I think.   So I guess Vasquez got his red card for that? But why not Vini too?"
Gotta get used to it since Inzaghi's gonna be on the touchline next game.
"Far from just these 3 players. This shit starts at the management and board.

Rudiger is a fucking idiot. That should be an instant exit, embarrassing behaviour. Throwing fucking ice cubes and acting like a fucking kid and ready to literally assault the ref.

Overall the ending was the most pathetic reactions I've seen in my 20+ years as a fan. And my god am I tired of Vini's behaviour. 

This ""us versus the world"" victim mentality from the board is not working at all and will just distance the next generations from Real as ""the best of the best"". We look pathetic to the rest of the community.

This shit has to stop now but it won't because the board backs this. Get rid of the players that so obviously negatively influence the mentality of this team. It starts to impact the younger players who then start acting the same way. I don't care if it's Vini, Rudiger, Bellingham or anyone else. They can fuck off if they act like this.

You literally have Ancelotti enabling the behaviour, praising Rudiger's performance and Bellingham saying every 50/50 went their way. Fuck that.

There's a serious lack of actual mature players and that will impact this team and these young ""superstars"" for years - as well as the entire image of the club."
"It actually felt like vintage Real to me, right up there with the Mourinho eye poke.

Also I'm not judging. It's obviously morally wrong and everything but.. very fun to watch."
Hate to break it to you but abusing and trying to intimidate the referees is [vintage Real Madrid behavior. ](https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/they-were-overcome-by-military-pressure---did-general-franco-help-real-madrid-thrash-barcelona-11-1/6hicxub57kla1nn29zr34jiqe)
"They’ve always been entitled. This is a particularly extreme example of that, but nothing new"
what image？
I'd say that employing your institutional power to go after the referees right before the match in an attempt to influence their decision making should be viewed as much more disgraceful than some player losing his head during the game.
"What image? They've always been entitled pricks. The manager, the players and the fans. That's what Madrid are at their core.

Entitled, corrupt, deluded, toxic shitheads that think they deserve success just for existing. When things don't go their way they throw their toys out of the pram like there's a conspiracy against them. There's no heart or loyalty either. A manager can win the double and Perez will sack them next season for not doing it again. 

Legends like Ronaldo, Casillas and Zidane will get booed by the fans for not delivering the trophies the fans believe they are entitled to every season. Even after fighting and winning major trophies for them in the past. As soon as they start to struggle the ""supporters"" stick the knife in their backs and shame them publicly for not feeding them the trophies they feel they deserve just for existing. 

The players aren't any better though. They cry and moan to the press constantly when they lose a big game. They will throw a public strop over not winning the Ballon d'Or because they believe they are entitled to it.

The entire club is soaked in narcissism and entitlement. That's the very essence of Madrid as a club."
This type of behavior has been the image of Real for some years now 
This is exactly who real Madrid have been for a very long time now. This is just reflecting that image. If Donald trump was a football club...
"Is there any confirmation of a 3rd?  Everything I’m seeing just says 2.  Rudiger and Vasquez

EDIT: nvm. Just saw referee report.  3rd red for Bellingham"
"Forget Franco - it's right there, in the name. People like to ignore the fact that their stadium's namesake Santiago Bernabéu was a bona fide fascist."
"Both of your clubs are full of wankers tbh

El clásico is the only game I hate watch on both sides"
"Oh look, the francomodin!! Wasn't expecting this sub to become this schizo. Already surpassed soccercirclejerk"
"Not that it changes anything, but Missgeburt would be better translated as freak in this case."
When the guy who beat his girlfriend is telling you to calm down you need to take a look in the mirror
Shake harder boy!
my 6 y-old cousins think the same way!
true. the dog stop barking when the leash is off.
"Yeh they deffo get away with fucking murder, so you wonder why the refs are putting up with that shit - it feels like theyre part of a mob, and the refs are getting threatened by mob bosses. Honestly, its disgusting."
"Yeah, even if you don't agree with these being given. In Spain these have been consistently called as fouls over the last 10 years."
"For those of us who know, this has done nothing to damage Real's reputation. That club has been utter trash for a long time."
Why on earth would anyone hold Madrid in high repute? They've had loads of players who are violent and/entitled pricks and they've been putting out official media channel videos against refs for a while. Just because they win a lot doesn't mean they are a reputable club.
"RM has set back their own reputation. Calling out the ref before the game. Rudriger is a dirty cunt and always has been. RM doesn’t care as long as he delivers.

I’ve never cared about RM losing as much as I do today. Poor sportsmanship and a loser mentality."
as an argentinian please do anything you can to make Mac Allister stay in your club
I love Liverpool fans. My absolute favourites. They can make anything about Liverpool. Anything. Never change.
"Yeh i thought that. Not a good look.

Be interesting if the next manager puts his foot down or not."
"No one’s discussing the foul cause it’s a clear hit to the face. Madrid reacted to this like they got robbed but it was clearly a foul. It gets called everywhere else on the pitch, the fact Mbappe was in on attack at the last second doesn’t mean he should get special privilege or it shouldn’t get called."
We completely failed this season. All this drama antagonising the referee just makes us look like entitled pricks. Never felt more ashamed as a fan. We gotta do better. Pack it up and go again next season.
they’re not half as good.
Yeah you’re alone on this one bud. Crazy how you cry victim when the ref gave so many calls in favor of Madrid and no reviews and any penalties except for the one that clearly wasn’t a penalty.
"The ref and VAR literally didn't call 2 stonewall penalties.

And this foul which btw however soft it is, Mbappe hits Garcia with his hand and it gets called.

You wearing white jersey doesn't mean even your hand on the face fouls should go unnoticed."
It's the correct decision. Hand in the face is always a foul.
"yea man!

great job defending your man child players lmfao"
"Title says full incident of the protest, not the actual foul."
"So even if it were a flop which is debatable and real also had their fair amount of flops, you think it would justify this clown behavior ?"
Change your flair man. Your entire comment history is about refs favouring Barca and being against Madrid. If you have the audacity to complain about the referee in this match from Madrid's POV you're about as braindead as they come.
"Extending your arm to hit a player in the face has always been a foul, no matter how much you call it a dive."
Mbappe slapped garcia
How is it a dive when he hits him in the face? real got a goal disallowed for the exact same thing when Bellingham was hit in the face.
"Even if Garcia dived (he didn't because there was contact), there's no excuse for acting like this. 

There's no room for behaviour like this in sports, actually even society. Just sick sick sick in the head."
"Such a gentleman!

And nice to see a fellow Sechzger!
ELIL"
Draymond should have been suspended for double the amount of time he was. He’s still clearly not learned his lesson.
RFEF: best we can do is 2 games and 50k fine
It's not just throwing something he completely lost his shit was more than willing to throw more stuff and the verbal abuse.
They literally reduced the ban on mbappe just because he could play this final.
3 months when most of it would be over the off season wouldn’t be fair.
He has the immunity totem. He’ll never get 3 months
There are no standards in Spain I'm afraid
la liga : alright 3months ban (including summer break)
Correction: 2 games suspension is the standard for all Real Madrid players.
Calm down. Arda Turan still played the match after throwing his shoe at the linesman. This is comparatively little.
"I feel like this one actually will be a multi match ban because they won't be able to nudge the decision using the referee report. Mbappe got away with the report lying about him going for the ball, there's no such defence for Rudiger here."
"He straight up assaulted the ref, there is no fucking way he doesn't get a lengthy ban."
Its much simpler for the RFEF to go easy on a foul during play than come off weak when their own official is getting abused. Especially with all the shenanigans Real was pulling this week I would expect them to come down hard on Rudiger for this.
This is completely different than a bad tackle. Rudiger should and will get a lengthy ban.
"Who knows, this team is fucking cooked at this point, some of the best players in the world not performing at the level they should be, Carlos might even get sacked. Sad sights"
"I wish we would stop with this narrative, Mbappe got one match ban because of the ref report, that is what determines how long the player is out, not the player or club or even the RFEF."
Michael Jordan retired for almost 2 years from 1993-1995 during the prime of his career and played minor league baseball. Many people think it was actually a gambling-related suspension that was covered up because the NBA didn't want to tarnish the image of their main star.
"Retired for a couple of years to play baseball. Word on the street is it was a deal because of him gambling on NBA games (?). The NBA didn’t want to bring their biggest player down, so they made the deal."
"at the peak of his career he had a betting scandal, paused his career to play professional basketball for a year, then came back and won everything again

I think there are rumours that he might had to leave the sport due to the betting scandal

  
edit: baseball instead of basketball"
Was? He’s still playing and very much a cunt over in LigaMx in Mexico.
Did we reall got to a point when people do not remember that Ramos was a gigantic cunt? It was his main thing even over footballing skills. Classles dickhead.
People don’t really overlook Ramos’ antics.
I think being a count is a requirement to be a real defender 😂😂😂
If you ask 1000 soccer fans to vote for most nasty personality on the pitch I bet Ramos would be in the top 5. He was a cunt but is certainly not overlooked lol
"Often getting romanticized as ""our cunt"" by his fans.

Seeing a lot less universal support towards Rudiger though, maybe because he comes across a tad more insane."
Rips into Messi's leg then lashes out further by shoving Puyol in the face.  No Messi injury made it sweet knowing that he got THAT riled up by losong 5-0.
"Alright now, humble yourself. 

RM is corrupt now, but during that era, Barca was literally known for Referee best friend at that time.

Dive everywhere, foul everywhere, you literally cant touch Barca players or they act like you just shoot them in their face."
" Read it again, you'll know what I mean. ;)"
the joke is that the referee is his teammate
They'll add it for next year. 
Że typowi pociąg odjechał? Pierwsze słyszę xdd
"Yeah he ain’t doing shit, this is all posture. The most he did was throw ice packs from 100m away. I would love to see if he had the balls to do anything up close"
"Based on Troy Deeney, after threatening to punch a match official you actually just get a lucrative media career"
That staffer about to be bullied in training.
"The last time I like RM was when there was still Beckham, Zidane and OG Ronaldo in there."
I hate them with all my heart
Pulling it out of your ass is a quality tbf. They also weren’t really outplayed in 24
"Bruh, not that unlikeable…"
Crazy how casemeiro never had a red in his Madrid career then got 2 in his first few months with man u
Whoa whoa whoa. Don’t drag Classemiro into this.
He's clearly exhausted. He always tales the blame for everything despite the horrendous recruitment by the board. I think he can't wait to finish the season and head to brazil
"It wasn’t just Rudiger, you have vini and Vazquez invading the pitch and shouting stuff at him. It all comes from not instilling discipline to them and them getting away with stuff"
As if Mourinho wouldn’t be going for the ref alongside Rudiger
Conte would make Rudiger his bitch in less than a week
More like Conte
Mourinho would be throwing at the ref with rudiger so no
"You also believe the Earth is flat, don't you"
"We can start with a ten match ban, and then see about therapy."
Also funny his aim was quite good lol
"That is every successful Club ever in every league. You are Just gloryfying Low Level / ""your oh so Holy favourite"" club


Insert Bayern munich / man City / PSG / Barcelona / even the Likes of RB Leipzig and so on "
All I've seen of this game is this clip. Why was Bellingham carded and not Vini?
"For jude , why ?"
you're tweaking if you're both siding this
Get fucked then
This is the right way. Both are villains and everybody following spanish futbol knows perfectly. Unfortunately we will be downvoted in this circlejerk sub.
"Truly insufferable, both of them"
penalty al favor del real madrid
"I'm genuinely baffled at people saying ""Rudiger/Vini setbacked Reals reputation"". What reputation, they were already quite disliked by everyone because of how their players behave"
You lot are the Real Madrid of the Premier League. Always crying about the refs.
Crikey this actually hurt coming from an Arsenal fan.
"yeah but i didnt watch the game, if it says >>full incident<< you expect to see the foul that actually caused the outrage"
"Never said I defended them, just questioning the objectiveness of the video."
"Nope, the behavior is unprofessional and scummy. I wasn't arguing the red card, just admiring the cutting of the clip"
"Thanks, your comments will be taken under review and the suggestions taken into consideration. The whole team wishes you a great day!"
Slapped? Right. Punched actually! Ran him over with a car! A tank!
"He has understood that part of R.Madrid's hymn that says ""caballero del honor"", knight of honour..."
"It’s ok, Kerr spoke to him and he won’t do it again. The media reporting it though, they broke the code."
For real. Nobody in the NBA is treated more like a pretty little princess by the refs than Draymond.
"For the referee, for daring to get in rudiger’s way."
RFEF: Three months ban for the Bundesliga and FA Cup 😈
I hope Spanish football not turn to blind eyes this time.
Yeah if the only reason you don't assault a referee is because you're being held back by 2 people then you deserve a ban nonetheless
hes clearly fighting for the ball as u can see ;3
I am not a Real Madrid fan but I've asked 3 of my colleagues (all referees) and they all said that he went for the ball but was late on it so it should not be a multi-game ban.. I don't agree but hey
Look at the crest on his shirt
[ Removed by Reddit ]
The only precedent I can think of is Arda Turan who threw his boot at a linesman and he just got a yellow
Rudigers for thee vibes....
"didn´t assault the ref but attempted, he was restrianed"
"La Liga: “one game ban, but can be for any game they want in the next twenty years”"
"Meh, we know he won't.

He should though, guy was playing with wrapped bandages lmfao. He should have some rest because he couldn't even run properly in that game."
"He will get 2 matches at most. Stop with the holier than attitutde. You're Real Madrid, this is Spain."
What is 'lengthy' to you though?
Absolutely nothing sad about it tbh
It was actually a cover up for a basketball game he had to play against aliens to stop the looney tunes being kidnapped and turned into theme park attractions on an alien planet.
"I know his numbers weren't great, but the fact that a 30 year old athlete - 10 years removed from the game - can walk on to a professional roster and still manage to hit a few home runs is nuts. "
Also the death of his father
"wasn’t it actually because his father had died and his father always wanted him to play baseball? the whole reason he died was so sad, I remember reading it was because of gambling issues or something"
The notion that the NBA/Stern would shadow ban the face of the league and the greatest cash cow they've ever seen is absolutely absurd. It's beyond me that people actually believes this.
What is your source for this?
"Wow if he paused his career to play professional basketball for a year, then what was he playing before that?"
You mean pulling Salah down and breaking his collarbone wasn’t an accident? 😮
It’s literally what people remember him for 
Yeah I’m sure Ramos and Pepe kickboxing the other team on the pitch played no part in it
Always a Man United fan cucking for RM
"Yeah, I don’t get any fans of big teams acting like they haven’t gotten ref favor. 

Before VARdrid was UEFAlona…

United with Fergie time and all that went with it. City these days with their technical fouls.

I’m sure the rest of Germany sees Bayern as a pure team with no ref favor at all…"
"Barcelona were never known as ""Referee best friend"" to anyone who watched football lol."
"I dalej, że nie pociąg, a cały peron"
Deeney was such a good lad outside of football though! /s
*released for unrelated personal reasons
They were outplayed in the Etihad last season
Shit refereeing on both sides. Got away with murder at RM and then gets sent off for super soft incidents as per PL standards of refereeing...
That shit eating grin of his getting away with everything at Madrid
Always flying under the radar
"Yeah I've said since the beginning of the season that the lack of signings was going to blow up in our faces, and here we are.   Ancelotti eats the blame everytime, and je deserves some, but Perez is more at fault for ignoring the teams needs and instead chasing his trophy Galactico regardless of whether it actually improves the team.  One of the most successful coaches in history is going to be leaving on a terrible note with far too many dumb madrid fans saying that he's a clown or a terrible coach that lucked his way into titles.  He deserves better"
They showed him on the touch line towards the end and he still had no facial expression but he was a shade of red I haven’t seen him like before
Yeah didn’t he sick a bunch of fans on the ref like two years ago
Is it too much to ask for an entire season?
According to the refs report Bellingham approached him after the final whistle harassing him and got the red then
"I'm sure he just had some nice, friendly words to the ref. Respectfully, of course."
He complained and said fuck off to the ref post game.
he was complainimg after the FT whistle with the referee
You make me blush
*But the offside flag has been raised.*
"Fair enough, they should have included it to be honest."
finally VAR is working
It's the same foul that all Madrid fans agree was a foul when it happened to Bellingham and Almeria's goal was ruled out.
"
I don't get it, are you trying to justify throwing shit at the ref for a 50/50 call (which it wasn't) not going your way?"
Sheffield Wednesday!!🦉🦉🦉
"Or rather, get out of his firing line."
Why would Everton do this?
Meanwhile spanish football association: what incident??
I guarantee you they already did.
They're football royalty though. They get special treatment. 
And he's doing it respectfully
"You don't have to be a referee to judge whether someone is attempting to play the ball. Anyone with eyes and any amount of experience watching or playing the game can judge that action. It's not an interpretation or understanding of a rule. Being a ref or not doesn't matter here. And if what you say is true, then your 3 colleagues are all shit refs."
I don't believe you. But if it's true it just goes to show that there's no hiding from blind refs.
Are these referees here in the room with us now?
Says the club which paid 7 million to Negreira
"Exactly. And, Arda Turan was still on the pitch and escaped a more suitable punishment. Rudiger was on the sidelines and he still got a red. If Turan throwing a shoe from close range is just a yellow, then Rudiger throwing a icepack/bottle from far is nothing more than a red."
"He threw his ice pack directly at the ref — 100% attempted assault. He's lucky the ref was so far out and he missed him, otherwise it would be a multi-month ban like Suarez for his 3rd biting incident. Oh wait, he's wearing white... 1 match ban and we're good."
He threw an icepack at him
"The threat is what defines assault, not harm actually being done. That aside he threw ice packs at the refs which believe it or not, is assault

>""Sadly a lengthy ban incoming for Rudiger.. I love him as a player and character, he just lost his head completely in the heat of the moment which is unlike him""

So you know what assault is you're just trying to defend a guy you know nothing about if you think something like this is unlike him. Corny ass. And before you cry about me going into your post history or any of that nonsense I didn't, I just saw it in that thread."
"He threw an ice pack at him, that definitely counts as assault."
Look up the definition of assault
"Doesn't matter how you word it, he assaulted the ref.

You can't throw objects and someone when the game is still on and not when you were part of it.

You can try and twist this but it's a matter of fact, he had to be restrained after being shown the red card."
Trust me nobody will have any issues if rudiger gets banned. We need to sign new centre backs anyway.
Well how about we wait first for the verdict before complaining about the future.
They made a documentary about this
"Psh yea okay, like that will ever happen. Let me guess LeBron James will have to do something similar too since he is the current NBA star boy. Get real man"
There's a good documentary about that incident
His manager said he would’ve made it to the majors if he had stuck with it. Insane to think about really.
"sorry, meant to write baseball"
"Baseball. Keep up, mate."
r/fuckramos
Salah was playing with fire when he wrapped his arm  around Ramos's. It was the Egyptian who locked arms first and then he got taken down for it.
That was an accident though. Instigated by Salah as well.
Like we didn’t see Barca get away with murder for years 😂
"As a united fan fuck RM, such entitled fans"
"I dont give a fuck about RM.

Check my profile, I celebrated their downfall.

I just stated facts, you guys are as corrupt as them.

2 biggest team who literally begging to create a Super League playing victims. Get the fuck outta here.

The difference between you and RM is that RM isnt corrupt to their own club, your club cant even pay for water at your facility."
"I think the difference is, they are playing like the biggest victim the moment of their downfall, like pretending to pull up from this game. That never happened in other team.

After United era was done, we werent crying to the ref like this.

Madrid act like a bitch as soon as the call werent in their favor."
"You're self snitching then, because uefalona didn't come from nowhere lol"
"Okay, City wins the ""They outplayed RM but dropped their balls during the penalties"" consolation prize for last season."
Big cheeks and big smile
"Madrid is trying to get the ref killed, so it checks out."
It's the same foul that all non-Madrid fans were crying about when it happened to Bellingham and Almeria's goal was ruled out
"No, i am not justifying anything, just admiring the clip and how it was cut."
Just an inschident
"I love how in all these years, that's the only thing you can point to. But we all got eyes, we all see what happens nearly every damn week in laliga. Vardrid should spent less on referees and more on building an actual functional team, then you wouldn't need that shit to win..."
He clearly wanted to help referee by giving him his icepack
So he attempted to assault the ref…
">We need to sign new centre backs anyway.

Perez feels differently"
Because I have decades of examples from the past to pull from
"Thats what they said to me last time about Mbappe and I was right lmao.

"Ehh, what's up doc? 🐰 🥕"
? What are you talking about? 😂
"Jari Litmanen was actually one of his ice hockey club’s best prospects before quitting hockey at 15. Former team mates (and later national team players) have said he could’ve become a professional hockey player and maybe even good enough for the national team. 

Ice hockey legend Teemu Selänne was similarly pretty good at football. 

Football & hockey is still a very common combo for kids in Finland. Hockey in the winter, football in the summer. Usually at the point where training gets more serious kids choose which ever they prefer to avoid overlaps. "
Damn I always thought he went to play in the MLB
Still rattled by the best CB ever.
You forgot the /s
Talking about super league when united hasn't touched ucl soil in 5 years
"Mate, your club doesn't even have money to fix the leak on your stadium's roof."
Oh yeah… I can get the talk about the behavior. But that’s maybe a quarter the post/comments. 
"I know where it came from. People who watched (or saw the highlights) of one single second leg of a tie that should have been over if the referee hadn't fucked Barcelona in the first leg.

  
A horrendous offside decision cost Barcelona the next year in the semis too."
"No doubt. A lot of people were incorrectly whining that it shouldn't be a foul. Madrid fans were right about it that time because it was a foul, just like it is a foul here, and now their players a throwing a massive bitch fit about it."
"I'm not sure, if you are troll or..."
When was the last time a player threw ice at the ref?
"Primoz Roglic was a decently good ski jumper, but he transitioned to road cycling when he was 23 after his ski jumping career stalled a bit. Since then h's won the vuelta 4 times amongst many other victories.

Remco Evenepoel even played a few games for the Belgian U16's and quit football 8 years ago. As a cyclist he's already won the vuelta and 2 olympic gold medals and lots of other races."
Last time we touch it we BEAT YOUR ASS. And our fidget spinner score on your trash defense.

Fair game if you decided you like Madrid. But don't come to give any lessons to the people who live through it everyday."
"Pipe down lad, your team is closer to the Championship than to Real Madrid or Barça"
Saying this to a team chasing treble while ur one of the worst pound for pound team in recent history is insane
What does this have to do with ny question?
"All the one who insults got no flair.

Lmfaooo, hiding behind their insecurities on what team they support to protect their feelings. What a pussy."
Insulting one team with another team achievement is insane.
That is a question i ask myself.
"Nah, they’re right."
Nah I’m just saying it’s shameless to be bragging abt a Europa league match that led to nothing 2 years ago when ur team is doing the worst it’s ever done in prem while the other is having its best season in a decade
Will be interesting to see how they do in the Championship. It’s a pretty big step up.
 Bah gawd is that Jamie vardy
Coventry just got a new rival
Next season will be Wrexham's second spell in the second tier and just their fifth season at that level overall.
I'm already fuming at the inevitable 1-0 away loss
"Coming next season:  
The Gang Tries To Do It On A Cold Rainy Night In Stoke"
"Vardy to Wrexham, here we go!"
"Scriptwriters need to start writing some setbacks in, this constant success will make for terrible television"
Cardiff's replacement. Congrats
Back to back to back promotions. Fucking insane.
Say what you want about the money they’ve been throwing about but Phil Parkinson has done an unbelievable job there. Deserves a statue when he eventually leaves.
Three promotions in three years is unbelievable
We're all living in Rob's FM save
Wonder how many years it’ll take before they hit the Prem. Unless it’s this time next year 😵‍💫
"bang on them all you want, every team wishes they had owners like this. congrats to wrexham and its fans."
The script demanded it. Again.
"Back to back to back promotion, sounds like something out of a Hollywood script"
3 straight promotions is mental
The Gang Goes To The Championship
The amount of people that hate them because... New owners bought in and genuinely invested in their team... Never made any sense to me.
Who here is old enough to remember John Toshack's Swansea City side who went from 4th division to the 1st in 4 years and then returned to the fourth tier in over 5 seasons. They finished 6th at their peak.
Haters will hate but its not like R&R were the first people to attempt something like this. They did it and deserve all the credit in the world for pulling it off. They didnt know a damn thing about soccer either
Congrats to them. Absolutely unreal what they’ve accomplished in such a short span!
"Well done Wrexham and congrats to the proper fans who have been there from the beginning. 3 promotions is incredible, albeit with a little bit of help! Bet you're in cloud 9!"
Wrexham doing career mode irl
Absolutely incredible
At what does Wrexham get to the stage where Rob and Ryan are not as wealthy as typical club owners in their league?  Will that be true in the Championship?
And to think of how close they were to fire Phil Parkinson halfway in his first season.
"I used to play 5 aside with one of their first team players, so crazy to see he's going to be playing championship football lol. Guy assisted me the winning goal one Tuesday night, from a corner, i backheeled it into the side of the net. I was actually trying to finesse it I just fucked up and then pretended I did it on purpose"
"Honestly, I know people love hating because of the Hollywood money and such, but I think this is actually an uplifting story, and 3 promotions in a row is insane. Next year for them will be rough in the championship, and if you are someone who hates them just cause you think it’s unfair, just imagine all the American fans who don’t really know the sport and how crushed they’ll be majority of next season"
"One of the best football stories in years. Proof that not all foreign billionaires buying your team are awful, just most."
The Gang Proves The Haters Wrong
What’s amazing is that Stockport has had essentially the same rise since five years ago (tho we’ll see about the playoff) without as much fanfare
Were promoted before Shedeur was picked by the Browns ROFL
"Don't really care if it's because they have more money, it's still a really fun story


Being a Wrexham fan must be a wild ride"
"""It's just money."" 

No shit Sherlocks, it's English football. Doesn't take away from what they've achieved."
"Congratulations to Parky, Sam Smith, and everyone at Wrexham except Shaun Harvey. Fuck you Shaun."
It's like an FM save
Probabaly the 6th or 7th best team in League 1 this year on paper. But they play so incredibly well together
This is where the ease ends. The championship is no joke and requires silly sums to compete.
If they can just be a competitive  championship team that’s a win
This is like football manager irl
"They'll have to maybe bin Parkinson off.  A great League 1 manager but ultimately his tactics are found wanting in the Championship. 

Perhaps with the trappings of Rob and Ryan though he'll have them in a decent shape next season.

Good luck to them anyway.  They deserve a bit of success after years and years of shit."
"The difference between Wrexham and other similar teams with a lot of money is that because of their extreme fame, the owners were able to parlay the purchase into a television show. By doing this, they massively increased their revenue, allowing them to not only spend a lot, but also avoid violating FFP rules. 

Wrexham isn't just a team, it's a brand, and a television show. 

And that's why I consider myself a hater. But good for them."
Unreal…3rd promotions in a row!
why doesn’t every club just get a large influx of cash to win their leagues? are they stupid?
Is this feat unprecedented? That's crazy.
this is gonna be a hollywood movie soon. the championship is a big step up
Wycombe dropped the ball 🥀
Can’t wait to get put in a 40 minute dramady episode where they thrash us 3-0 and Paul Mullen does Hermansen’s wife
"Our documentary was better, Sunderland that is but for thr wrong reasons 😂"
I've been their biggest fan since forever.
Vardy will go nowhere near Wrexham. He is well past it now. He will end up playing in the MLS
"I genuinely never thought I'd see Wrexham in the second tier in my lifetime. I'm 100% certain we're going to die in the championship, but just being there is remarkable."
Unreal rise. Nothing but flowers. For every doubt there was a promotion to answer it
The vibes are nice over there.
Secret ingredient to English football league survival: US money
Man people are maaaaad in here 
Will be interested to see how they handle playing in the championship
That's pretty insane
Championship is the real challenge now.
I dont think i could even do back to back to back like that in football manager lol. Congratulations to Wrexham!
My FM 2014 save is coming alive.
"I'm old enough to remember Former Wales, Manchester United and Chelsea great Mickey Thomas playing for them, he was 37 at the time. 

It's a great time for the town and the local fans, and I hope they just try to stay in the Championship and not spend a fortune trying to go up."
That’s just insane. So happy for their supporters! Can’t wait to see how long it takes them to get to the prem.
Is this where they aren't quite rich enough?
"let this be a lesson to you: with determination, grit, a whole community behind you, and tens of millions of dollars in lucrative endorsements - anything is possible"
Congratulations to them for making it—it’s a huge achievement. But let’s come back to reality: the jump from League One to the Championship is massive. They’ll be lucky to avoid relegation in their first season. Their squad just isn’t at the level needed for the Championship right now.
There's no way they get promoted within 5 years. The Championship is known as the hardest division in football for a reason
"[Phil Parkinson, god's gift to football](https://youtu.be/g0LfYqbCe64?t=100)"
Imagine they make it to the Premier League 💀
Hope they get absolutely torn apart in the championship
Is it not ‘are promoted’ ?
Unbelievable achievement buzzing for the fans and people of wrexham just hope they can't more backing to keep them in the championship
Not an easy feat - congratulations
Deadpool vs Boilerman. I can't wait 😂
WELCOME TO WREXHAM!
"This is where it ends most likely, spending goes up so much in the Championship."
"Jamie ""chat shit,get banged"" Vardy to help promote to the Premier League sounds lovely"
"5yrs in the championship being bottom-mid-table, owners get bored and sell, drop back to league 2..."
Absolutely crazy because like 4 years ago or whenever the first season of Welcome to Wrexham was released I had genuinely never heard of them now I have become a proper fan of a random welsh team and watching them succeed. Brilliant story.
"With all due respect, they are going to need massive upgrades.

I think. Paul Mullin is finished in Wrexham too, but his contract lasts another 2 years."
"I wonder if they’re scaling too fast. Staying up has to be the goal, although at this rate they’ll win champions league in 2028."
The last promotion thread was full of this too. People saying they’d struggle in League 1. But agree the Championship is an even bigger step up.
Everyone said that about league one
Feel like I've read this same sentence the past 3 years xD
"We’ll struggle with the current lot, but we’ve got a solid base to work with, providing a couple more signings. The best I hope for is 15th"
This is what people were saying about this season. But I agree this is gonna be where they finish mid table I think
I think they will get some key investors to join the ownership group that will pump a lot of money into the club
It’ll be trickier than previous seasons. Only a few out of contract and the more recognised names haven’t been the star turns this year.
Staying in the championship should be their top priority. The wealth gap is enormous. They'd need a huge investment increase to even think about finishing in the top half of the table.
"They are fortunate that they have a lot of FFP space, and they need a massive spend to increase the overall quality. The Championship is the toughest league due to so many teams being of a good quality, teams with parachute money. Their squad is very average. 

I’m a Derby County supporter, we’re barely surviving, we got promoted with 3 more points last year than Wrexham have this year, and I’d say our promoted squad was better than the current Wrexham one. The most important part of Championship football is getting a striker who can get 15-20 goals, that may still cost us this season, and will cost Wrexham if they don’t invest. 

Mendez-Laing made the L1 team of the season, well deserved, was destroying defenders last season. He’s looked so awful this year, the step up has been huge. And looking at Wrexham this year, quite a few of the top players face a similar challenge. The drop off for players in their early thirties is massive. 

Take someone like Marriott, Derby signed him for £3m after he scored 27 in league 1, he looked like an amateur in the Championship. And then a player like James McClean, is similar to our old CB Sonny Bradley who looked very good in League 1 but just wasn’t cut out for the Championship. 

They may now benefit from being able to get some decent MLS signings at this level, with either work permits or an ESC. And they’ll find it easier to get 4 quality loanees from PL clubs.  They may struggle to get top players at this level if the training ground and stadium facilities aren’t at the right level.

Their goal should be to raid the top League 1 players that don’t get promoted. There are a lot of good players in the league who can step up. 

Ipswich got up with a great manager, Wrexham lack that."
Box office TV if he signs. 
You might just have called it here. I wouldn't be all that surprised if it happens
Holy shit that would be perfect
"> vardy

that would probably fit with their strategy to gain a big social media following. Has he said if he is going somewhere after leaving this season?"
Put money on this quick
SUB FUCKING SCRIBE
Rebekah Vardy in the owners box!
Vardy's daughter gonna drop some F bombs again. 
Honestly I never knew how badly I needed this.
That will be crazy if that happens.
Don't think they can handle vardy 
That would be beautiful

This would feed families
Nah fuck off
"Coventry could still get promoted, although they are trying their best to stay in the Championship atm."
Swansea just got a different rival
How has Frank Lampard's Coventry been doing?
Last time we were up there was 50 years ago I believe.
"Was going to say, when was the last time they were above Cardiff in the league? Thought it was going ages ago but it's probably in the late 90s when Cardiff were on their uppers"
Give yourself some credit it could be a 2-1 loss
1-0 loss turned into a 40min tv episode featuring Will Ferrell
Vardy party incoming!
I used to look at the Wrexham story as a cute football story from a far away land. Now we are playing the bastards next year… talking about meeting each other in the middle.

not unless Stoke gets relegated
I miss those matches (not at all)
The gang goes to Millwall.
"They do it every other week in STōK, so i don't think Stoke will be too much of a problem."
I was thinking Bristol.
Scoring a winner in promotion playoffs against Leicester.
lmao I could imagine the bake on Rebekah if that happened.
"They’ll escape relegation next season which will be a setback but ultimately a success. I worry about if they establish themselves as a solid mid table championship side for a few years, how do you make that good TV?"
Even ted lasso got relegated
this season had a few twists and turns. they lost a crucial game and looked like they were out of the auto promo but they wycombe lost 2 back to back games. 1st season was a failure too where they lost in the playoffs which was hard given all the investment. also a terrible start to the season.
Can’t wait for the Disney vs Netflix derby
They need to get fat
Better call Jay Shah
"Well, they had the slight setback in that they came up against us, so they weren't able to get another title in that streak, or even come close to it. But Wycombe have been poor in their last two games, which has let Wrexham off the hook a bit."
Welsh Derby will hit different next season
Cardiff now third best Welsh team lol
"This could fuck their women's team who easily won the AP 3 times in a row. Would love to see the Wrexham ladies go fully pro now, it's time. "
3 straight promotions
Certifiably mad.
Can they make it 4 promotions in a row?
"3 promotions Jeremy, 3?! That's insane"
When you’ve got one of the highest wages in the league every year it’s not that hard to
"Honestly, people can whine about the money, but if it were this easy, any person with a big bank account would’ve done this. It’s just really intelligent investing of the Hollywood duo and the people responsible for transfers."
Let's see how he does in the league he has a notoriously terrible record in.
"Tracking right on schedule, In about 3-4 years they'll win the premier league.

Source: Me in FM23 & 24"
They might never reach it. I'm not saying they won't but this is a whole few categories harder than what they had to deal with until now.
I've been asking that question since we went down 25 years ago. People aren't prepared for the 8th layer of hell that is the Championship.
"People are really doubting them but I want to see what the revenue they can bring in now will be. The championship is infinitely more accessible for viewers, at least here in the US. They could be pulling unprecedented deals for a club like them."
I also think as owners go two Hollywood actors is actually quite good and more ethical than 99% of clubs.
"I don't see the problem with Wrexham, not only they bring local and international attention to the lower English pro leagues but also they do it completely legally, I really think that the mayority of people that hate them do so because they are fans of teams that had an owner that did the same but instead of having success those owners completely destroyed their team"
"Idk everyone seems to be pulling for them for the most part. It's reasonable for people to have doubts about the challenges of a quick rise up the pyramid, but I didn't think the criticism is coming from a negative place."
"I would understand the hate if this happened in Germany, but wealthy owners are completely normal in the UK and they're not even that wealthy compared to other clubs' owners.


At least this isn't a vanity or sportswashing project like a lot of other investors. They seem to genuinely care about helping a historic club and it's community and they've made a huge effort to be involved with the fans."
"Yea, there are so many disaster stories with much richer owners that practically destroy the small clubs they buy because they just do it as a 'business move' or vanity project or even as a toy to play with. None had this amount of success because Ryan and Rob seem to be genuinely invested and it shows. I mean if they just saw this as a 'show fodder' they wouldn't put all this effort into it. And the focus they have on improving the city as well shows that, yea, they are seriously about it and that leads to fans, coaching and players buying in too."
"I think people were just ""annoyed"" at the way they were promoted. the tv series, the ads, appealing to US audience. 

It was different, it worked. They were media men and they used media to promote the team.

A billionaire could buy Altringham and pump the same amount if not more in and I'd say people would be less pissed off"
"it's the constant ""fairytale"" bollocks being peddled by themselves and by the media when the reality is they've had a mid/top League One squad since they were in the National League. This is the first year they've actually just about exceeded expectations. 

I don't hate them for spending money I hate everyone else telling I'm supposed to think it's impressive to outspend every team in the division and win it."
"Honestly, it's fucking pathetic. When it's from fans of other teams in the National League and now Football League it's obviously just jealously, but I have no idea why fans of clubs in any other league would be so upset by a club getting wealthy owners who actually engage with the fanbase and community and have successfully and smartly invested in the club to help them climb up the divisions. 

People will complain about the same teams winning all the trophies every season and faceless billionaire owners with ties to the goverments of countries with extremely dodgy human rights records buy clubs, but when a new club gets wealthy owners spending their own money and attracting lucrative sponsorships and has some success, it's somehow a bad thing too. I don't know what people want if Wrexham's success is somehow as abhorrent as Man City's or PSG's."
When smaller teams have success through investment or good business models it's feels unnatural to a lot of people
"The extra hate isn't really for new owners buying them and investing, that happens all the time and clubs do get some hate for it but nothing like this. It's more around the media circus around them.

Because of the documentary, every match is always just the media talking about Wrexham and their owners. Often hyping it up as plucky underdogs Wrexham and a fairy tale when they had better players and had spent more money their opponents in a lot of cases. Of course fans of lower teams will feel disrespected.

In the Championship subreddit people are dreading it for the same reason, and it's not just Wrexham, it's to a less amount it's certain managers as well because the media knows little about Championship clubs so everything becomes about ""Frank Lampard's Coventry"".

Now Wrexham have done well to get 3 promotions even with money, and it's not completely their fault about the media, but it doesn't mean people will like them."
It is strange. I’ll stick to hating them because they’re Welsh.
They are fine with 'Saudi chopping up journalists' money but draw the line at 'American Hollywood actors that genuinely cares' money.
"I think it’s not just that they invested, it’s that they invested and didn’t get in the way of people who knew what they were doing. 

In a lot of instances (not just in soccer) you have a new rich owner show up and invest but also try to play manager and end up messing things up because they really have no idea what they’re doing."
stop being mean to the epic ted lasso hollywood fc team guys :(((
Because it’s for a Disney+ tv series. Just a bit lame innit
"I don’t hate them, I just think it’s a bit of a double standard that a lot of the people who keep hailing them as a fairytale underdog story are usually the same people getting mad at Man City or Chelsea for buying success. It’s the same thing just on a smaller scale."
"Northampton did something similar in the 1960s. In 9 seasons, they went from 4th division to the top flight and then back down to the 4th division again."
Michu my GOAT
"Say what you want about the money, like you said many many owners (richer than them as well) have tried to buy their way up and it didn't work. Their recruitment has been absolutely top tier and the club seems to be being run incredibly well."
Just look at the class of 92 and Salford City if you ever want to compare a story of wealthy owners taking over a lower league team. Night and day
I'll admit I never heard of Wrexham until the documentary but I've followed them along since they were in the national League. It's pretty cool to see as a casual follower from across the world. I'd imagine the town is absolutely buzzing right now
The bandwagon fans don't get a congrats?
"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_owners\_of\_English\_football\_clubs#League\_One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_owners_of_English_football_clubs#League_One)

  
This would put them 8th richest owners in League 1 this season, though lots of incomplete data in the list as it has no figure for Birmingham's ownership which spent almost 10x as much on transfer fees as Wrexham did this year."
"They’re at best mid-level for championship teams, right? 

Though Ryan is pretty damn wealthy, most of that wealth is still tied in to his acting career and not separate investments. "
that would’ve been this year.
There’s some very wealthy clubs in the Championship. Can Rob and Ryan afford £5-15m x 10 players?
It was already true for League One.
"They'll have been one of the wealthier owners in League One despite the replies here suggesting they're not, but crucially they were also more willing to fund the club than other owners. Their revenue would be higher than most other League One clubs, probably only Birmingham were higher, and their losses are likely higher on top of that. They likely spent more on their squad than any team except for Birmingham.

Next season will be the first where they're not in the top 2 or 3 based on revenues and playing budget, but they also probably won't be near the bottom in the Championship."
They weren't that wealthy for League 1 standards.
Also hating because Hollywood money is kind of ironic since it can not compete against the oil money in the higher up.
"\> just imagine all the American fans who don’t really know the sport and how crushed they’ll be majority of next season

I will adjust accordingly and root against Wrexham more"
"To be fair neither of them are billionaires, yet."
Haters in proper shambles today
"You're not wrong, first thing I thought of when it looked like they would go up."
Sure beats blood money
"Shit, what a great idea!  BRB, gonna find a sugar daddy to buy Aaron Pierre a flight to every fucking match

Fucking fairytale"
You never know. I’m sure some aging players with a little left in the tank might agree to go there for the notoriety alone.
Just money in general. But honestly No. Carlisle United are relegated to Non League today after being took over by American ownership which actually spent a lot a year ago.
"I don't know where this victim thing comes from, most comments are supportive?"
They aren't even the richest owners in League 1 by a wide margin lol. Like not even top 5. What they have done is genuinely impressive.
"Yeah brilliant mate, congratulations on learning how football works."
Nothing like a yank chiming in with the same old trope. The Team still has to perform exceptionally well to get promoted 3 times
"Also, through God all things are possible, so jot that down"
Anything can be a fairytale depending on how good the PR team is
The thing is that. Wrexham is kind of fucking poor in the context of football world. Not the big spender even in the League 1.
Tell me you're butt hurt jealous without using the words.
It's also going to be interesting because they had insane money for the national league and league 2... but they're now in a league where they're no longer rich as far as ownership goes
"they should be fine, the bottom half of the championship isn't a massive step up from L1 judging by how Oxford, Portsmouth, Huddersfield and Rotherham have done respectively this season. Sunderland reached the playoffs from getting promoted not long ago"
Depending on the goals - If they want to be doing anything but fighting for survival from day 1 they'll need to turnover probably 9 or 10 of the XI.
Hello Jamie Vardy
They'll get Vardy I reckon
People have been saying this since their first promotion. They’ve consistently improved every season.
They need to stop signing 36 year old players that played in prem. Besides McClean they are really lackluster signings.
Imagine they'll have to loan Mullin out and subsidise his wages. Can't see any other L1 or L2 side paying that.
Mullin hardly featured in 2025.
Mullin deserves to score one in the PL for his son
"After summer signings, apparently Mulllin is not playing at all"
This club is doing in real life what I do in FIFA.
"I didn't think anyone expected to win this year, their goal was to stabilize in the league for a season or two before pushing for more (and probably pick up an investor or two while in league one).

Now they have a really difficult decision - do they try and spend more to bolster the squad and become championship Mainstays (risking a big wage bill if they get relegated), or do they spend conservatively, just fight to stay up, but not be too badly impacted by a relegation."
"I think most felt they would be solidly mid table in league 1, not that they'd struggle. The squad they have is honestly a mid-strong league 1 squad (with a good few ageing players).  This has just been a season where everything clicked and they beat expectations. 

My concern is the championship is a step up and they'll need to cycle a lot of players, which will definitely impact the continuity. Fingers crossed they can survive the championship, would be very surprised if they even approach playoffs tbh (but I would love to be wrong here)"
So Wrexham CL champs in 3 years?
absolute scenes if vardy helps wrexham get promoted to the prem and leceister stay down.
Everyone has been calling it as son as he announced he was leaving Leicester
He didn't announce his retirement so safe to say that he'll keep playing.
Wouldn't get great odds as it's been a really popular prediction
Bets on whether Luton stay up after beating them today lol
"Yeah fumbled in the last few matches. They're being chased by Middlesbrough, Milwall and Blackburn. Milwall and Blackburn face Rank 1 and 3. So not easy points. Coventry themselves face Middlesbrough. So it's very much in their hand right now. Even a draw can be enough for playoffs. And this is when they were in the relegation zone by December."
43 years ago in 1982.
Is Wrexham historically the best 3rd best club from wales? Behind Cardiff and Swansea?
2001. Wrexham and Swansea in division 2 (L1) and Cardiff in division 3 (L2).
We haven’t scored at home since November…. It’s more than likely going to be 2-0.
"Inspirational victory for the Wrexham against the incredible former premier league champions what a story

Should really be a Netflix series"
Oh my god Wrexham please sign Vardy and have Rebekkah or whatever the fuck she spells her name narrate an episode
Fucking brilliant 
Imagine haha
That's when you focus on what actually happens inside a mid table club. The threat of relegation looming forever over the horizon.
Women’s club. Investment in the stadium. Academy development. There’s a lot of angles and I’m not smart enough to know them all
If they are a solid mid table Championhsip side for a few years I don't think they'll make the PL unless the club is sold. Welcome to Wrexham can't last forever unless something is happening with the club and the American fans will lose interest.
"HIre Rooney as manager, sign Vardy, and make their wives sit next to each other every week"
"Like it'll still be a show at that point. Three years mid table, ratings will drop and Disney will take a polite pass."
I feel like this is a safe space to say it was fuckin moronic that they were competing for a title in the last season when the FA cup was right fucking there and more believable.
"It’s not fat, it’s cultivating mass"
Let's go Swansea (seriously)
They have been promoted each of the last three seasons
"If they get promoted again, I'm fully believing we live in a simulation and somebody is playing a football manager save"
"Realistically? I mean it’s possible if Rob and Ryan bring on a third very wealthy owner but I don’t think they have the money to get a promotion-caliber team put together by themselves. 

That being said, the sponsorship money is kind of nutty "
Only two seasons away from the Champions League.
Scenes when they get promoted again then win the premier league the next season.
"Not a chance in hell, not without investment of 30 or 40 million. 

If it does happen, all i can assume is someone is running a Football Manager save and set everyones playerstats manually."
"They definitely had a leg up on the competition in the last two years, but this season their cash output is pretty normal by League 1 standards, no? Regardless money is linked to success but it's not an absolute guarantee, you still have to perform on the pitch"
"You mean like winning a UCL after being bought by a blood-drenched russian oligarch and spending a couple billion pounds in players, huh?"
We'll know for sure when they start signing wonderkids from Kazakhstan or Panama
Apparently they have similar revenue to many mid-table squads. But their true edge is the fact that any player who signs will be featured on a globally popular Disney show. That is a bigger pull to a Championship level player than I think people give credit. Players are like anyone else and will want to brush shoulders with the celebrity owners.
every league they get promoted from is pissed coz they lose that streaming viewership.
I don’t think it becomes that much more accessible to watch them in the US. Paramount plus showed most Wrexham games already. It’s not let me they’ll get more opportunity in the US now. Certainly they may show up more regularly on TVs in England
"Is it? I got paramount+ for the league one games, how would i watch championship games?"
"I've never understood why having rich owners who genuinely seem to care about the club, attend games, and aren't extracting value from the club is a problem, or is more problematic than having faceless oil barons as owners."
Absolutely. At least it isn't a country sportswashing
Ya it's easily one of the most ethical ways to accumulate wealth
"I know you're covering yourself, but I wonder who'd be on the 1 % more ethical than a couple of actors?"
Football fans are the biggest hypocrites going yeah but Wrexham have spent a lot of money to get here so I can see why some fans would take issue
"I'd be way happier with less ""international attention"" if it meant no Wrexham buying their way up the pyramid"
"It’s more the whole plucky underdog spin that people kept trying to bring up. We spent the last 10 seasons in league one Wrexham had 4 times our revenue while they were in the national league, they’ve been far wealthier than their counterparts in leagues two and the national league other than Birmingham they’re probably the richest league one side as well. What they’ve done is very impressive and they’ve done it in very palatable way but this isn’t some underdog story that a lot of people have tried to paint it as, financially they’re a championship side but regardless three consecutive promotions is very impressive"
"It's not normal in the lower league of England where football still has some semblance of normality. Us lower league fans don't really consider the top of the Premier League to be playing the same sport as us, ever since they officially detached themselves from the football league in the 90s."
"Didn't the class of 92 try something like this with Salford, in cahoots with that fucker who ruined Valencia. Not everything can be achieved by throwing money."
And Wrexham the town needs all the help it can get 😂
"Yeah it's the ""plucky underdog"" narrative that gets on my wick, I'd love to have them as owners and admire the job they've done but let's stop bullshitting everyone like this wasn't financial doping."
"Because it's celebrity owners dominating the headlines and being able to dictate it as an ""underdog story"", industries like Sky Sports thinking all clubs are ""The Premier League and also Wrexham"", the impact on footballing culture in general in the lower leagues.

There's a big reason people are ignoring. The reason why Birmingham, who spent £15m on a player in League One, aren't getting as much flack as Wrexham. It's the media circus."
"why is it difficult to grasp that some people don‘t like millionaires buying up clubs and speedrunning through the football pyramid on steroids? I don‘t give a shit *who* does it, the principle of it pisses me off."
"Whilst I do see your point, it's also the source of the money and the engament they seems to have with the actual community of the town. Plus come on, lets be real some of the hate it's coming in from the fact it's two owners from North America (I assume a lot of people don't know that Reynolds is Canadian) invading English football, and because they seems to know how to marked themselves to the people who are the most surface level of all the football loving world, the yanks."
I think people are more upset about where the money for Man City and Chelsea came from rather than the money itself
"Don't know if you're joking but wrong era. Toshack's Swansea in the 80s got to the first division, won some matches against all the old top four sides, even topped the league a few times, had injuries and finished sixth and were relegated the next two seasons before Toshack got the sack."
"Seriously, why hasn't Salford been able to do something similar with their owners all being ex Man Utd players? Just goes to show how good of a job the people in Wrexham are doing."
"Money is one thing. Smart use of money is an entirely different thing.

I'm not an expert on the business side of the game by any means, but it looks like they seriously have spent wisely in every department you could."
The documentary helped me get interested in lower/non-league football as a whole.
"Lemme guess, you're Mancunian?"
Part of the difference in spending I think it's the fact that Wrexham basically had a l1 level team in l2
Birmingham's owners are 100% multi billionaires lol
"""Acting"", lol.  I mean Ryan was part owner of a cell phone company also."
He sold his gin company for 800 million and sold his stake in mint mobile for 300 million.
No. Their salary this year was like 10m per year *total*. They will very much be on the lower end of the salaries in the championship. The step up from league 1 is massive.
"No it was not. I'm not sure why people are repeating this, but bar Birmingham they were big boys in terms of spend."
I understood the bitterness when they were squeaking out of the national league but they’ll be quite moderate compared to the ownership wealth in the championship. 
I think owning a club is a sure way to ensure they won't be either
Isn't Ryan?
"never count us haters out. We'll be back, hating more than ever"
He’s been a bit of a failure previously at this level. Will be interesting to see how he gets on next season.
"Big clubs might loan out players too, to help them build brand. Would not be surprised if Mikey Moore from spurs will get loaned to championship next season"
De Bruyne going to Wrexham confirmed.
You can see who set up their narrative stall a few years ago and haven’t bothered to check if it’s still backed by facts anymore. They just want to hate on what’s happened so are stuck in their same criticisms from two years back.
3rd highest wage bill tbf. That said Parky has obviously done very well
I don’t think people extend that sentiment to City winning the league 4 times for example
"They are one of the highest and they've only just got promoted into it. They are not underdogs, sorry. Next season they may be."
"They'll surely turn to outside investment. And that's where things get tricky... they need money that stays out of the way.

I wish them all the best, it's been a great ride as a football fan. Paul Mullen, Ollie Palmer, and other beloved players are gone next year. That's the price of such a rapid rise."
"[Their revenue is already bigger than the Championship average though.](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce92zk757vlo#:~:text=Wrexham's%20revenue%20is%20staggering%20%2D%20but%20not%20surprising&text=The%20annual%20turnover%20has%20exploded,for%20a%20League%20Two%20side.) If they continue growing like they have, they'll have a revenue closer to £40 million next year, which is almost double the average in the Championship."
"But in turns of income, they’re doing pretty well thanks to the Amazon show"
"For perspective, Stoke is earned by billionaires who routinely write off tens of millions of dollars' worth of debt, and still consistently places in the lower to middle section of the Championship table."
Their sponsorship will sky rocket.
"Big difference between Sunderland and Wrexham though. Wrexham will be punching above their weight for the first time so will be more reliant than ever on owner funding, whereas Sunderland were getting over double the crowds of Wrexham in League One and have the biggest attendance in the Championship.

They're also competing with teams with far richer owners and PL parachute money."
Huddersfield aren’t in the championship tho?
It’s a massive step up. Make no mistake.
"We had players like Alex Pritchard, Patrick Roberts, Jack Clarke, Ross Stewart (pre injury). We had prepared for promotion with young players who would develop like Dennis Cirkin and Trai Hume who were bought all the way back in League One. We then managed to build on that with some fantastic signings like Dan Ballard from Arsenal.

And we had Amad Diallo who is probably a top three championship player of all time, probably technically/ability wise the best."
Mate you went for Sunderland but Ipswich literally just did back to back promotions from league one to the prem how did you forget that lmfao
"I'm not sure they need 9 or 10 turnover but they'll need a big infusion of cash and a number of signings.

I've seen the bottom of the Championship and Wrexham looks quite a bit better than most of them even in its current form."
No chance if they do they are crazy.. relying on a 38 year old striker works in league 1 or 2 but not in the championship..he will end up heading to the USA
"They had a League 1 squad in NL/L2/L1, this is the first time they will be below the average quality without massive upgrades."
Thats phil parkinson's recruitment strategy and it will let them stay up comfortably next season but it wont get wrexham near the playoffs..
Vardy incoming lol
Apparently the goal was 5 years to the Championship so they are a year above schedule
I dont think doing anything conservatively is the american way..
I think they would be happy to stay mid to bottom mid championship for a few years. I honestly don't think they will struggle to maintain in the Championship
Screw you!!!! *** but you are not wrong though****
There's absolutely no way they'll get promoted.
"all Luton needs to stay up is win, because stoke and derby have to play eachother, so if luton wins they jump over one of them"
The funny thing is you won't find a Boro fan right now who actually wants us to be promoted.
"That's a disgusting stat, not scoring at since November? My grandfather could score at least 1 goal and he's been dead for 12 years."
"I lived in Preston until July last year and the mood around there was very much “We’re a solid midtable club, not relegation candidates but not promotion material either - and we won’t be either for a while.” 

They’re currently 1 point away from the relegation zone with 1 game to go."
Your missing obvious murder love triangle angle.
"Good for actual football fans, boring to the people who mostly watch the show for the feel good factor of Wrexham’s ‘fairytale story’"
"The Women's team has already hit the top, unless they move to the English pyramid there is nowhere for them to go."
Check in with former players at their new clubs/life
100% would love to see more of an investment into the women's club. It made for an incredibly interesting viewing.
"Yes, they kinda reached their ceiling now..

American (plastic) fans will get bored after 3 or 4 seasons without a promotion, they could try for deep cup runs tho.."
I fully agree but also the show wasn’t made for fans of English football nor  “believability “.
"All they had to do was survive relegation and win a cup final, they get their fairytale ending in a way that seems believable. The one thing I didn't want the show to do when they got relegated was have them eventually be competing for the title when they get back up. 

S1 had Ted being clueless, relegated and only surviving because he had the support of the players. Having them compete for the league with the likes of Man City was a major jump the shark moment that the show never earned."
"Pretty wild that out of the last 3 seasons, they have been promoted 3 times."
"Each of the last three years, they've gone up a league."
"I can't even do that in football manager, they must have the editor enabled"
Tom's Sim (but somehow doesn't help Lincoln city)
They brought on a billionaire family this season. Attracting more billionaires at an ever increasing evaluation will be the goal.
Tbf the same could've have been said of Ipswich. No one in their right mind had them as automatic promotion candidate last season
And then Champions League the season after that. Where do they go from there?
RemindMe! April 2026
"They're getting to a point where money alone won't be enough though, we've seen so many teams splash on promising players and still struggle. I hope they make it though, I really like Rob!"
Like Mansa Musa
"On DAZN Canada, the National League package costs 3 times as much per month as the base package, which includes every PL match.  

I can't imagine anyone is buying that now that the Disney circus is long gone."
"I took note of them but don't watch league 1, you can bet i'll catch them vs Leicester at least"
I believe they play on ESPN+
"Could be jealousy, could be a dislike of things related to America, but I think a lot of it just comes down to the fact that they're such high profile owners that fans can't just put their head in the sand and pretend money doesn't determine everything in this sport."
It’s not people just don’t like the advantage in funds they have had over most clubs in the lower leagues they have been in but if it was the other way around they wouldn’t have a problem with it
"You are right. As owners go they are good. But what got on my nerves, and on the nerves of many others who follow lower league football, was the entitlement of the new fans. 

Not all of them! I'm not trying to gatekeep football, but some of the stuff you'd see online just showed a complete lack of understanding of lower league English football and the new fans (mostly yanks) just had a really entitled and naive attitude. 

They acted like the whole league should be bowing down and marvelling at Wrexham, as if the rest of us were just NPCs to Wrexham's great and noble main story. Which makes sense because I assume that's how the TV show portrays things(I haven't watched it). 

It gets grating after a while having a load of people who have never even set foot in an English football ground telling fans of other teams how they should feel and acting surprised that we aren't all cheering and celebrating with them. Acting like we should be grateful and feel blessed to have the mighty Wrexham coming to our tiny little towns.

You can see how that gets annoying right?

I was glad they got promoted last year and the whole circus went away to be honest."
Philadelphia sportswashing
"Fan owned clubs, maybe some local businessmen putting money back into the community, but yeah slightly covering myself."
"Salford city also has rich owners and the gas is owned by two men from kuwait, whom im sure are also millionares."
Lower league clubs all over are owned by rich dudes too. It’s just that a.) the owners aren’t celebrities b.) the teams aren’t as well known as Prem teams
"Semblance of normality? there's always stories of horrible owners, clubs going in administration or even defunct, stadiums left to crumble. Finally somebody goes and invests in a team (with actual local fans), rebuilds the stadium, manages to have success and people are just hating on them."
"Lower leagues of England are full of cases of shit owners that invested a ton of money into the teams, completely fail and now they don't want to invest more and are trying to sell"
Are you speaking of non-league only? There are rich owners all over league two/one
I think you'll find we're a *city* that needs all the help it can get
"Because football is a sport and the point of it is to try and win. A team getting new owners who actually invest in the club smartly to push them up the football pyramid definitively is not a bad thing. Not liking the ‘principle’ of it is just torn-faced ‘but muh tradition’ nonsense, the idea that all clubs should just settle for where they are unless they can progress in a certain ‘acceptable’ way, whatever the fuck you people think that is, is stubborn stupid nonsense. 

In the end it’s just jealousy, absolutely no-one would complain about it happening to their club, only when it’s someone else."
"The source of the money absolutely comes into it, you’re right. Deadpool and the guy from Always Sunny are obviously much better owners than a Sheikh, a Russian oligarch, or the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Saudi Arabia. I actually really like both Reynolds and McElhenney, and am pleased to see them raising the profile of the sport in North America.

But I can’t help but feel that I’d be more than a little pissed off if I were one of the National League or lower League Two teams that now had no way of competing with Wrexham just because some famous people decided to pick them for their latest project."
saudi and russian oligarchs are one thing but there is nothing as morally abject to me as profiting off of ryan reynolds’ film career
"That’s a fair point but it’s not the criticism you see. From my experience people complain more about clubs buying success, and the sports washing side of things only comes into it as a noble justification. Decrying blood money is easier than appearing jealous.

This is just my interpretation though, I’m more than likely entirely wrong."
"Wrexham weren't a sleeping giant but they were a sleeping very big person. One club city and a huge, passionate local fan base."
"Tbf salford was 8th tier when they took them over, have a much lower capacity ground, and dont have Ryan Reynolds pull."
"Ill do you one better, I don't even know what Mancunian means"
"Look at the incoming transfers from 2023-24 vs 2024-25. They definitely spent way more this year than last year. Wrexham still had a much higher transfer spend this year than most clubs though - closer to the amounts spent on teams promoted to the Championship last year rather than their fellow L2 --> L1 promoted teams, however still not necessarily the richest club in L1"
Those are full numbers right ? He’s a part time owner so he got way less
"Oh I thought he still fully owned the gin, interesting. "
Hmm. That’s bottom 5 in the championship. There are clubs in the championship with over 50m+ salaries.
That was during their L2 season. Bet it's 1.5-2x that this season.
"They had the most money, yes. 

But, there is a difference between the richness of the owner and the richness of the club. Wrexham's owners werent among the richest in League One. However, they set up Wrexham in such a way that the club's revenue + money Ryan & Rob give the club makes it one of the richest in LeagueOne."
No. He is worth [350 million](https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/ryan-reynolds-net-worth/)
"I do get they have resources that other teams don't but the difference is how those resources are used. Ryan and Rob building sponsors for this club to actually invest in the team is so much different than City style pumping money in. They care about building this club and are doing it in a sustainable way.

Sure the Disney money helps but 90% of rich owners would be running away with those profits over actually trying to be great. And even at that it's great to see the banners flying local brands while Meta is on the Jerseys they still stick to the clubs roots. Power to them."
"I mean sure but it's not like there aren't over a dozen teams in League 1 with the resources to do this. Difference is Wrexham owners actually want the team to succeed and while they bring in more revenue than a typical League 1 team they use it for the squad.

Barnsley owners are worth 9.1B this isn't about money."
They’ll be able to get it. Plenty of rich people would pay to be seen as friends with Ryan and Rob.
If Mullin is willing to accept a back up role he still can stay. He has  enough quality to be a Championship back up or a squad player.
Oh they'll definitely be selling 49% of the team.
Are them two not good enough for the championship
This would be a good time for Rob & Ryan to end the documentary and cash the fuck out
wouldn't shock me if they spent the last three years lining it up already
All of that was in L2. A full year before an actual billionaire came on for 15% and stayed hands off. 
"Yeah, I assume they’ll struggle, but it won’t be financially. Remove parachute payments and I suspect they’ll be pushing the top of the championship next season.

Probably have a kit deal bigger than most of the prem."

"It's on Plex, homie."
It’s netflix bro but yes
yeah I don't actually think they'll make playoffs but they should be mid table by dint of the dreadful  ownership standards of basically everyone from Blackburn down. All of the promoted sides should hopefully survive this season
"Wonder how soon after they survive/establish themselves they'll want to get bigger gates.

Surely they'll have to rebuild, but they'll need investment for that. Who are they willing to be tied to, as they're still he equivalent of a hipster overpriced burger place, two crazy guys with a dream"
…neither’s Rotherham
"It's a step up, but it isn't a massive one. Trying to get *promoted* out of the Championship, now that is a massive step."
"It definitely is, but people also said the same thing about League One, and even League Two iirc."
"Enough teams have done back to back promotions to suggest it's not.


If anything the real struggle is getting out of league one, looks at teams like Leeds and Wednesday who struggled for ages."
I was just thinking of current championship teams forgot them lol
To do more than fight for survival? Idk. Maybe 9 or 10 was overshooting but definately at least half.
"Don't think that's true. I think they've always had a squad 1 above where they were + 2x L1 players (Lee + Mullin). I don't think their national league squad was a L1 one. 

This yr it seems Mullin didn't even play, but they had some championship standard guys already.    

But anyways yea, they need upgrades- and I think the aim is just to stay up next season."
"They absolutely didn't have a L1 squad in the NL, hardly any of those players are still around. They probably had a L1 squad in L2, but not a good one. The signings this year of Smith, Dobson, Rathbone, James etc have been essential to Wrexham being a top L1 team. As has the continuing development of young players like Cleworth and Okonkwo. They would have struggled to finish top-half with the team they had last season."
The source is Mullin on Sky sports after the game. 
"Championship is super tight. Look at the relegation scrap right now. Before the last matchday, only Cardiff is relegated, and they're still only 5 points below the line. There are few easy games, the teams have bigger budgets, and some of them have legitimate PL quality players. Not saying they won't stay up next year, but easy isn't the word I'd use to describe it."
mate your ownership is fucking diabolical. a leicester vardy needsto be in the prem
"I agree with you but they said that about this year as well. 

Sports is fucking weird."
Like there was no way for Leicester to win the league. You never know 
RemindMe! 365 days
I swear they said this about league 2
We’ve scored away. I’ve just not seen a goal at home in forever. Think I’ve seen more goals from the children’s team I coach this year.
That’s why i think the whole idea of mid table clubs is dumb. People were predicting Leicester to get into Europe in 22-23 except they got relegated. Similarly Brentford went from newly promoted to amazing to mid in a few seasons. No one is a “established mid table” for more than a few seasons max
"Not hard to tie that in to a continuation of the feel good factor. But I get what you’re saying, too - success feels good"
"You’re right but if they’re 3 seasons deep, they’re basically just Wrexham supporters now. "
"They have the most amount of promotions possible in
the last 3 seasons (3). Advancement"
"Not only that, but they were also promoted two seasons in a row before this season, making it three in a row. Wild."
"Promoted thrice in thrice seasons, very very thrice"
You can actually. Just need to save scum a lot.
They were ranked around 5th favourites for promotion. Absolutely loads of people had them as promotion candidates and pretty much every prediction table I saw had them in the play offs if not better.

"Lyrically [he] packs heat, you pack a tape gun"
👏👏 thanks brother
I don’t think that’s true anymore. I think paramount bought EFL right in the us this year
"Awww hell yeah i already watch it for some la liga, didnt know that was there

Thanks!"
"Definitely jealousy. If fans of other clubs that were stuck in the wilderness got the cash and exposure Wrexham got they wouldn't be complaining. 


I don't hear too many Manchester City or Chelsea fans grumbling about the success they got from being brought by wealthy owners. "
"We just got a usl team in town and the core supporters are generally work from home yuppies who just moved here the vibe is cringe , annoying supporters are the worst"
Yes and they’re wildly disliked by the teams in their league i don’t understand your point? What Wrexham have done is impressive I’m not arguing against that it takes more than money to do what they’ve done but just because other rich clubs have struggled doesn’t mean they’re underdogs
"You forgot c.) the  owners are egotistical and think they know better than football professionals so they stick their fingers in every little decision. 

Rob and Ryan hired pros, and stay out of the day to day. They don't need football to stoke their egos or prove themselves, that's what their acting careers do and have done."
"it is just jealousy, everyone wants that big bank roll takeover for their club"
"> From my experience people complain more about clubs buying success

It's a very strange argument though. Up and down the entire football pyramid, the teams that do the best, are the ones with the better players which is usually due to more money."
Holy shit haha!
Not a bad spot to be in when you can sell the company for hundreds of millions and then keep getting paid for your image/endorsements lol
"I'm not sure if ""sustainable"" is the right word, because if Rob and Ryan left then obviously a lot of the sponsors and other revenue would disappear with them. They're not saddling the club with debt it seems so it's not like they'd leave the club in a terrible position, but realistically they probably wouldn't survive in the Championship without Rob and Ryan as owners."
"From their finances, Wrexham AFC doesn't actually get any money from Disney. Well, a little for licensing their logos and such, but Disney is how Ryan and Rob are individually making money. What the Disney series gets the club is all the eyes which is what gets the sponsors and the extra kit sales.

But at the same time, I also give Rob and Ryan credit because they do seem to actually care about the city. They kept the clubs old kit sponsor on at what had to be well below market rates, and they recently bought the brewery in town to help grow them. 

Really, fair play to them, and it is a lot better than having a Qatari investment fund buy the team."
"So Barnsley's owners should run the club at a massive loss just because ""ambition""? What happens when everyone does that? Only 3 clubs get promoted"
"they also have brought quite a few of the celebs from the lafc ownership group to games, wouldn’t be shocked if that became something"
"We already have it mate, we brought on those syracuse billionaires this season"
"I'm sure their friends are rich, but not billionaire level rich, which is what it'll take   to be on the same level as championship clubs. They need more than Hollywood celebrities to chip in."
"He's not even L1 quality, no chance he plays in the Championship"
He's not making the bench in league 1.
"i think he need to quickly shift careers, if he wants to be connected to wrexham he should try to get some management/media/trainer position, if he wants to capitalize his fame he should be a pundit for wales"
"Yes, revenue figures for 2024/2025 are obviously not in yet."
"It's been a great show but there's no drama on the pitch anymore, so all the content has to come from the squad and fans and there's only so many times you can keep telling the same stories. I don't see the L1 season being much better but maybe next year will, they'll have more struggles in the championship and will end up signing a lot of new players meaning fresh stories."
"Give it a few years, everything will be Disney"
Everything is on Plex.
"Having a stable owner goes a long way these days sadly, just having an owner willing to fund the club is probably enough for survival in the EFL."
"100%. No way they go down. They’re already making revenues higher than the likes of Preston, Millwall and others realistically I’d imagine. They will struggle to break top 2 relatively quickly but think they’ll get playoffs in the season after next."
"It will be interesting to see where their attendance caps out at as well, tourists aren't going to fill out the stadium every week. I'd guess around 20,000 is their natural cap in the Championship."
Birmingham have been promoted from L1 at a gallop. I don’t doubt that you’ll be at least mid table next year but it’s a big gap for most clubs.
"You'd be crazy to say the gap between NL promoted sides and l2 is big, most promoted sides the last decade have finished top half l2."
Actually a lot of people familiar with lower leagues football were saying during the Wrexham/Notts County run in for the National League that if Wrexham got promoted from National League they would be confident of getting promoted the following year from League 2 as there isn't much of a difference. One of the fans in the documentary says it as well.
"Ipswich were the first team to do it in over a decade, it's very rare. All other teams to do it were ex-Premier League/top tier teams with far bigger attendances."
Why are we the example for struggling to get out of League One? Would've been promoted first time of asking if not for the points deduction despite being on the edge of going out of business and then were promoted in the third year.
"I dont agree, if they want to aim for 15-17th, they only need 4 or 5 (mostly defenders and a midfielder)..

You forget that next season will have oxford, the owls, derby, Portsmouth, luton, qpr and probably stoke competing in the championship, all of whom arent great atm and wrexham isnt too far behind them."
" Top (the owner) is way too nice and not confrontational. He was thrusted into the role after his dad died, and he is a lot less ruthless than Vichai. He lets John Rudkin, our director of football, have way to long of a leash, and Rudkin is a certified moron who makes moves that only an idiot would make (giving out contract for enormous weekly wage to guys who underperformed, pushing out Cooper for an unproven RVN, beefing with Kasper Schmeichel and Vardy). At this point, I am not sure what can be done, but Rudkin has gotta go. The dude is doing more damage to the club by the day"
"Palace would beg to differ. Since their promotion they’ve been what, 10th-15th every season"
"Basically everyone outside the big 6 is only one bad year away from relegation. Even the clubs who look like they're flying, Brighton, Bournemouth etc. Happened to Leicester, happened to Southampton and it'll happen to them. 

That said United, Chelsea and Spurs have shown in recent years we might be getting to the stage where it's not even true of the big 6 anymore."
Everton has entered the chat
"Surprisingly, they actually have a 100% success rate of promotion in the last 3 seasons"
"They went up, they went up and they went up!"
You really don't.
"its because despite the aim to justify why dynasties exist in the football leagues with so called big clubs (i.ex. the big six in the PL) who deserve success, they try to whitewash it with ""historical success"" as some kind of heritage

  
sorry, no arsenal, united, spurs or whatever fan really hated roman buying chelsea because of the allegations of his past and the way he earned money, but for the fact that he made chelsea a powerhouse and took their clubs place for nearly two decades

its more of a reddit thing that people seriously hate sportwashing, the regular fan would choose to take the newcastle fans  approach and celebrate if lets say a billionaire be it with his own money or state funded would use to sportwash his native country to make them the newest powerhouse in english football"
"I mean yes but more so I mean it's not financed by massive ownership injections like Birmingham, Leicester etc. at however levels"
"I don't think they get money straight from Disney but I do feel like the money Rob and Ryan get for having one of the most popular Disney shows is certainly helping them cover Wrexhams losses in an indirect way. What is curious is that a broadcaster will have not a material one but a direct interest in a team.

But it has been a crazy takeover. The ad banners will have Gatorade, United Airlines and Tik Tok followed by a local trailer company lol.

I think people will be surprised how much money is available to them for the next level and with large corporate interest in their success I think they end up being pretty successful. Likely through additional partners while Rob and Ryan maintain control."
"Almost every football club runs at a loss. Look at the Premier league only 4 teams made a profit last year. Ontop of that it's likely they are about break even this year financially.

Also would bet almost every league 1 team is running close to a ""massive loss.

And just because I want to further rub it in your face Wrexham lost 2.7M in 2024 and Barnsley lost 2.8M so what's your point here?"
"If I were Wrexham, I would set up some sort of partnership with the MLS to have young talent come play in the Championship and it’s a win-win for everyone. Such a good deal for the US that they could probably get the Federation to play some of the wages.

I can see them get a big manager just for the clout. Someone like Jesse Marsh who can build a program up.

EDIT: To clarify, I don’t think any player in America or anywhere else in the world is able to push this team to the Premier League it will be a long process. I am talking about forming a partnership with the MLS where they have some talent be part of the youth setup up in exchange for promoting the team. Wrexhams benefit is the financial aspect not the players."
Tbf there are a lot of bench players in the Championship that aren't Championship quality. Some of them even start games for whatever reason.
"I haven’t watched him or Wrexham much this year. Was it a case of him just finding his level in League 2, falling off due to age or fitness, or something else?"
I assumed he was injured!
"I think playoff is a big ask. The players that have carried the from the conference are aging out now. They can can be a decent lower/mid table easily. But they need some rebuilding to get to playoffs. If they get the recruitment right then they can do it, but recruitment isn’t as easy when you’re actually at financial parity with the competition."
"It's not us I'm referring to - or even Ipswich for that matter. Most newly promoted sides stay up for at least that first season, and generally beyond that as well, unless they have specific circumstances that would've screwed anyone.

* 23-24 promoted sides; Oxford United are safe in 17th, Portsmouth in 16th, and Derby County look very likely to stay up as well.
* 22-23 promoted sides: Sheffield Wednesday and Plymouth both stayed up, even putting aside Ipswich. Sheff Wed have been a mid-table side this season and the only reason Plymouth are going back down is because they decided to hire Rooney.
* 21-22 promoted sides: Sunderland went straight into the playoffs and remain around there, Rotherham stayed up but went down the year after, and Wigan got screwed by corrupt owners.
* 20-21 promoted sides: Blackpool stayed up just fine that year but struggled the next, Hull stayed up and were around the playoffs before the ownership decided to be idiots again, although Peterborough did come up short."
Yeah there's no difference between the top of the NL and the bottom of L2. I say this as a fan of a team that has gone between the two a lot. There is a huge bottleneck at the top of non league
"I wasn't the one saying it lol. Regardless, people *absolutely* were saying that about League One this year."
I mean I think we’re going to have to consider how much more marketable the already marketable Wrexham just became. The championship is streamed on ESPN+ in the US and I think they’ll have a lot more eyes on them now abs will be able to improve revenue to compete
"Ipswich are technically an ex-PL side, just it has been a long time. Also, their attendances in their League 1 promotion season averaged 26k, and 28k in the Championship one; I think you're massively underestimating Ipswich there."
15 points who gives a fuck…
Isn't this exactly what I'm saying? A few good additions and they probably can avoid relegation. Comfortably mid table or higher they need to replace the entire XI basically.
"In defense to Top, he's been busy trying to rebuild King Power's revenue flow after the insane damage COVID did to it. It dropped by almost 80% during the first year of COVID and has only now climbed back up to around 60% of their peak."
40-49 points I believe
Everton who were near European places with Ancelotti and then in threat of relegation the past two seasons?
This is a wild stat that not many people have noticed but they are three for three on promotions the last three seasons.
"They went up like the house in up, then up like Matt Damon in the Narsian then up like Bruce Willis in Armageddon"
"Unless you're using some sort of cheesy throw-in or corner tactic, you really do."
"The revenue/wages ratio (along with absolute revenue) is what's relevant here, barsnley's billionaire owners are not

Also the accounts you're referencing are from Wrexham's financial when in year national league/league two."
Young talent good enough to make an impression in the Championship would be good enough to be one of the best players in the MLS so not sure how that would work
This is real dumb
If I were Wrexham I'd sign Mbappe and Haaland imo
"This is such an hilarious take, never mind that these youngsters wouldn’t even get a work permit."
"Mourinho.

You heard it here first."
They wont fire parky unless they go down next season and thats a maybe cause i also hate hoofball but the guy has done wonders for wrexham so far.
Work permits..
"*Championship, Marsch"
"Shouldn’t be more than be 3rd choice for a team that plays with 1 striker, and 4th choice for a team that plays 2 strikers.

He’s miles below someone like Billy Sharp when he was at that age."
"Probably bit of everything, but he's always played League 2 his whole career. 

People seem to forget he's been around a while and never made it at L1, despite being in top L2 sides. 

The fact he dropped down to national league to be a flat track bully made people overestimate his ceiling."
"The have been pretty competent so far, the resources seem to be there, might be even more investment, and the championship is volatile enough that I think they could probably manage it in 2-4 years, especially if they get substantial additional investment."
Most of those teams didn’t stay up long (whatever the reason).
"yeah looking at the last three seasons promoted teams, even beyond Wrexham and Stockport, you've got Notts County who are guaranteed playoffs in League Two (even an outside hope of automatic promotion) and Grimsby and Chesterfield could make the playoffs too and Bromley are top half."
"They will improve their revenue, but even with that I doubt they're top 6 in revenue. You've got parachute payments and teams with triple the attendance Wrexham can get."
"Is their stadium big enough? Seems like match day revenue would probably be the biggest factor in success in lower leagues. No matter how much someone sponsors, it tends not to make up for millions lost (hypothetically) in match day money."
"I didn't mean teams other than Ipswich, I meant teams other than Wrexham. Wrexham are very diferent to the previous teams to do it."
They also spent massive money in League One and set themselves up to immediately challenge. (Similar vibe to another side going up this season.)
"Oh no doubt the big C was a factor, but Top should have shown Rudkin the door the first time we went down. Keeping the idiots after that hack job of a relegation is malpractice. How much bigger warning sign can you have than relegation?"
ok thats a little insane wtf lol
"Very true. Adding on to this, it is also important to note that they have not finished outside the promotion zone in their last three seasons! Another great stat to show what a rising club they are."
"Respectfully, skill issue."
"Loans, loans, loans, loans

And good free agent signing"
I love how some people think the MLS is better than the Championship. I remember seeing somewhere that the Championship was like the 7th or 8th best league in the world
"QPR plays with a lone striker, and we've still used something like 5-6 different strikers this season due to injuries and a tight schedule."
"At this point with the expansion of the league being basically all professional, it should just become ""League 3"" and get another promotion spot. That way it means Non-league remains regional."
"Their kit sponsorship needs to be renewed over the summer which should be very interesting. They already have A+ brand sponsors, so you would think the value would keep skyrocketing, but the US is also going into a recession which is where their sponsorship money comes from.  Does United and HP want to spend even more?"
"Ah, that would make a lot more sense!"
"If you take 4 promotions and then subtract one, that's how many promotions Wrexham has had in the last three years."
"Sure, I guess it is. But getting consecutive promotions all the way up to the Prem isn't something most people who play FM can do."
"Yeah, I think last season there was only 1 semi-professional team there, so it definitely makes sense"
"So have they had any promotions, then? I'm hearing that they possibly might have, at least over the last few seasons"
"I am generally surprised whenever FM youtubers doing their Non League to Prem series get stuck for more than a single season in the Championship, and they all generally manage back to back to back to back to back from VNL N/S to PL."

Insane strike but good job Bellingham lol
Bellingham should've pressed Pedri after he misplaced that pass instead of putting his hands on his head
100% deserved
What a goal. Couldn't have hit it better
Cubarsi should have a assist count here
Started and finished the goal with 2 class touches lol absurd
Bellingham had 15 seconds to run back and yet decided to stay planted there
"Great finish, damn. Been coming too, Real is just bad..."
"What a screamer!!!

BITW!"
"Yeah, deserved. Can't complain. Fuck off."

best midfielder in the world
"About damn time, let’s go!"
DOMINATION FROM BARCELONA
He's so good
That was a golazo
Pedri is amazing.
Did Bellingham’s controller disconnect?
JESUS HE CUNT PUNTED THAT BALL TO THE TOP OF THE NET
EAT FUCKING SHIT
Thunderfuckingbolt
"SHOVE YOUR TACKLES UP YOUR ARSE, REAL!"
Please notice Cubarsi cutting that pass out right before
"Utterly absurd strike and well deserved with how well they've been playing.

Satisfying to see after everything that's been going on around this game."
That Cubarsi tackle was as good as the goal
They're gonna complain about ref decisions again despite that obvious penalty not given against Ceballos. ffs
"This guy is having a Manchester City esque end to his season, ridiculous form"
that yamal to pedri connection
Damn. What a baller.
My ballon d’or 😭❤️
FUCKING PICK THAT ONE OUT
"My fucking goat, my balon d'or"
he's the goat bro i dont care
Jude giving the ball away then not even bothering to get back lol
"CUBARSI WHAT AN INTERCEPTION, PEDRI OH MY WORD WHAT A STRIKE"
pEdRi dOeSnt ScOre
MY BOY!!!!!!!!!
Pedri doing the Messi play 🥲
Terrific finish! RM are being outplayed so far.
Scores in a final = Iniesta regen
Commentator is straight up rap god
Thats an Anime goal
CUBARSI I LOVE YOU
Rare Pedri Banger
Felt like Pedri dropped straight from heaven to put that one in
Can’t wait for the toddler tantrum Real will throw if they lose this.
"I cannot believe they actually scared this fucker into submission, what the fuck are these calls"
That was clearly an offside or a free kick or something that this bad bad ref overlooked on purpose! How dare this corrupt ref....
Haha Madrid
Best player in the world
Madrid is recieving a reality check
"Grats on the 2nd of the season & 1st big one, Wiz. hopefully the other two 🏆 will follow too. tc, fam. u/WizDB :)"
The best player in the world...what a goal
BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD
Hahahhhhha get fucked Madrid
Pedri can do everything Bellingham does and more. What a player.
Absolutely world class. Madrid look entirely average. Newcastle and Forest eat this current Madrid team alive.
"Fran, mate."
What a tap in
Bangers only?
(Great goal)
Madrid are cooked
Best player in the world
Hes just that guy
Greatest player in the world
Just creamed all over my monitor my king
Give Pedri more space Ancelotti you moron. Washed up beyond repair.
Ethereal hatewatch
Ballon d’or
Put an NSFW tag there
Real is just absolutely abysmal. I’m a real fan.
Takes a special shot to beat Courtois from that distance
Beat midfielder in world right now!
The Real era is ended.
AMAING GOAL
Best 1-2 ever
What a fucking goalazoooo
Best 8 millions euros spent ever
Bro NO ONE was even looking at Pedri lmaooo
"That tackle tho, just as beautiful. "
Best midfielder in the world.
"4 white shirts couldn't stop lamine's assist lmao

He is him"
"Picking out that pass is fantastic but the weight of it sublime. Gave Pedri all the time to just stroll up hit it as clean as a whistle.   
Beautiful."
Amazing work rate from Real Madrid front 3 and Real Madrid TV.
"started it with the pass and finished it, insane"
MY BALON DOR WINNER
That pass interception by the defender deserves a lot of credit
Let’s goo 🙏🏽
Starts the move and provides the class finish
What a fucking goal!!
What a banger!
Unrelated but would luv if vini stopped whining about every fucking thing
€1 billion release clause seems like a bargain now
"Every step of that play was wonderful. The interception by Cubarsi, the pass from Pedri to Yamal, the patience and pass from Yamal to Pedri, and the finish from Pedri."
What do you even say to that? Insane strike.
Madrid got 7 players in the box and still nobody near him.
Excellent shot but dude has all the time in the world for that placement... nobody was even close to him.
Classic midfielders goal. Perfection.
PUT THAT SHIT ON RMTV
He so good man. What a player
Absolute class
Hang it in the Louvre!
Bellingham's man
Let's gooooooooooooooo
Everyone liked that
"Pedri doesn't have to score to be the best player in the world but i am happy that he scored against Madrid because no other fan base talks about Pedri's ""lack of goalscoring"" than Madrid fans"
Magician at work 🪄
"https://www.reddit.com/r/Barca/s/4SISlhgPux

I'm a prophet"
BEAUTIFUL OH MY GOD
The highschool connect setup for Pedri was immaculate along with the shot.
Cubaresi who started this all
Only beautiful goals from Pedri.
Off topic but does the production value on the English cast sound sorta amateur? Like the mic keeps getting hit and the camera work is weird? (I know the camera work isn't specific to the English)
"4 madrid players around Lamine only to leave so much space in their own box, definitely one of the decisions of all time"
How could the referee and linesmen allow this? Such anti-RM bias.
Madrid is now yesterdays news and Im loving it.
"If Barca continues with this form next year, Pedri is getting his Ballon Dor"
Best in the world and it's not cm punk.
Anyone who says Carlo can't be criticised is a gaslighting piece of shit. I don't know if a team can be set up worse
Goofy ahh hair colour
WHAT A BEAUTEEEYYYYYYY
he played the ball to yamal himself.
"very smooth goal

btw excellent by Cubarsi at the start, it was a very dangerous moment, he knows that he's too late to chase and closes the gap instead"
What a fucking goal
Nice goal from a good counter. Whoa
I love you Pedri
"ballon dor!  
ballon dor!"
What a goal.
What a fucking rocket
"Poor from Bellingham, should've closed down Pedri instead of standing in shock that the ball got blocked"
What a terrific goal
Can't believe Madrid went through with their threat of not showing up
Entire build up is Barca young stars: Cubarsi -> Yamal -> Pedri
Are you not entertained????
Absolute blaster shot.
Ahahha Bellingcunt was too busy showing his antics once again
Imagine releasing a video about the referee before the game and then play like this….
No VAR on that horror tackle by Tchouameni?
"Pedri wasn't even visible. But when Lamine passed it into the open like that, knew someone was gonna strike it into the back of the net."
Barca win 11 vs 14. Should be 7 yellow cards already for Real.
that was a classic prime Messi goal ngl
Bellingham's probably still holding his head in disbelief from not making the pass instead of tracking back lol
Play that slow mo of Raphina saying golazo in celebration a thousand times
"Tchouameni, Ceballos and Valverde all in the same spot , and Garcia leaving Yamal behind him, what a mess of a team we are."
OH WHAT A HIT
Terrible defending from Madrid
"Love Pedri man, go get another 3"
You know whats funny right before the goal bellingham failed a pass and put his hands on his head instead of counter pressing or tracking back. Pedri collects the ball sends it over the top then runs to shoot.
Best midfielder in the world.
"Pedri - assisted by Pedri


MY FUCKING GOAT 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐"
Pedri showing PR merchant Bellingham levels
How do you get cooked game after game purely just on effort and desire and continue to not want to put a shift in. You misplace a pass and just stand there with your hands on your head while the guy on the other team in the exact same spot of the field next to you still has the drive to sprint forward the rest of the field. Bellingham 🤣🤣
"Barca is like Superman . Instead of saving the world, they are saving football"
Who else but the goat
Whats with the morse Code lmao
Everybody liked that
Lamines patience and timing is out of this world
I am Pedrisexual
super easy balon dor sweep IF cl winner
Worst goal to concede
"Ngl, I would feel inclined to take off Bellingham immediately after this. What a twat."
"Pedri is a mix of Xavi and Iniesta.

He has all the qualities of what a quintessential Barcelona midfielder looks like."
"you guys are clueless, bellingham is not the one that made the mistake here even if he's doing something unnecessary. Ceballos has to mark Pedri, not be the third one to go towards Lamine"
*Arrives late in opposition area*
"Cubarsi cut a dangerous pass, pedri dropped a lot ball, yamal dribbled, and pedri again finished with a strike. Lol they are still kids wth"
I LOVE PEDRO GONZALES
Best player in the world this year!
if his name was Pedrinhos Jr and played in white the Spanish press would have the Ballon D'Or on lock for him
Pedri best player in the world 
"Everyone is saying he is the best midfielder in the world, I say he is the best player in the world"
Wow. 3 player in Lamine's side.\[
"Look at Bellingham man, so inspirational"
I can’t believe the ref would do this
"Aiiii Jude, can’t just be quitting on the play like that"
Goaaaaaaalllllll
Fkkkkk ya bitches we back h^M+ ref cant stop
Who the f is this guy L Martinez bro acting like he doin something out there 😂😂
Tbh RM can’t score for s*^%
"Can anyone without any jokes, slander or bias - having played the game or managed it tell me what they think of Vazquez as Right Back? For someone that size, at that position, at that age - how do you view him?"
Lampard regen
Simple one two
Greatest player in the world
Best player in rhe world
Yamal waiting for the perfect moment instead easy backpass or forcing to the middle. Patiently wait for Pedri. Good stuff
What's that beep sound?
"If Barça wins CL HE IS THE UNDISPUTED BALLON d'OR. If you haven't watched the team play you'll say Raphinha deserves it more, but Pedri's season is at another whole level."
"I couldn't be happier for this goal, Cubarsi, Pedri, Yamal and Pedri's word class finish. He finally deserved a goal himself so much. Best player in the team for the whole season. (Even if Raphina gets the attention... but as you've seen today, sometimes he just disappears for matches, Pedri never)."
Is he the best midfielder in the world right now?  Also excellent assist by Lamel. The way he took his time and got himself just into the position so he could pass through to pedri was great.
man pedri is so clear of mcallister
Barca finding absolute gems in their academy whenever they’re shit and going right back on top. What a player!
"Lmao wtf was he doing just standing there. Look guys I'm so sad my pass didn't go through, looook at meeeeee"
"That goal is not on bellingham, ceballos runs behind valverde + fran garcia to mark lamine, he's the one that has to go to pedri"
Or at least follow his run. He is not even in picture when Pedri shoots it.
Can't look for the camera and press at the same time
"Bizarre from him, he legit just stops"
Guy was thinking of TikTok compilations vs actually playing
I know Cubarsí was way less amped about that block than I would’ve been
"Exactly, he doesnt return"
"Was going to come here to say **exactly** this. I saw him do that and I was like if they concede from this, then it's so damning on his lack of pressing."
Leave Jude alone. Holding his head was inside joke gesture towards some close friends.
https://i.imgur.com/McdnYEV.jpeg
Are you not supposed to bitch after every play? Someone tell Jude!
"What makes a player behave like that? Ego, bad attitude or just oblivious?"
You live and you learn.
It's Ceballos who doesn't cover the center
Knew that was going in before Pedri touched it
That pass from Yamal was beautifully weighted too
RMTV gonna protest that goal as well
"""Threat the ref again and we'll do it 10×. They're not ready"""
Messi-esque placement holy shit
Tactically outclassed
Why would the ref do this
"When real lost the ball I was like “this mistake will lead to a goal, won’t it?” and it did lol"
plays a 60 yard diagonal on a dime and then follows up with a perfectly timed run and shot placed right in the corner
And played the initial pass lmao. Crazy
"Only his second goal from outside the box, I believe the first one was just as good"
we can argue that bellingham can have an assist there as well
Only 18 years old too. What a player
My fucking 🐐🐐🐐
Especially if you work at RMTV
Best CM in the world 🔥
Thanks for the warning. Definitely pornographic
"4 players committing to Yamal, schoolboy stuff"
"And fucking dirty. How that tackle from the back didn't get a card, I'll.. actually, I know why."
You can absolutely complain with Bellingham just standing there with his hands on his head instead of pressing Pedri
What a casual banger
"Journalists prefer strikers, it’s prolly gonna be raphinia tbh"
"He should be no1 in the rankings, the way he plays every single game. Instead it's just the forwards that get all the attention. No doubt pedri has been the best player in the world this season"
Best player in the world
"somehow? dude, this is totally expected, cmon now..."
Ima hold your hands when I say this…
"Surely no sane right back would, right?"
"Cubarsi tackle to pedri long ball to yamal to pedri again, crazy beautiful counter attack"
Best player in the fucking world. Pedri staying healthy is the biggest reason Barca can play the way  they do
"Entire season tbh

He's been brilliant throughout, Ballon d'Or contender at the least if not favourite"
What does this mean 😭
Please elaborate 
LAMINE I LOVE YOU
Congratulations to all of us for a well deserved trophy. Take it easy and Visca Barça💙❤️
Unlike a certain Rodri
"What threats, lol"
Neither the hitman
He was posing for the youtube thumbnail
"The damn refs, conspiring to make Real Madrid make repeated mental errors, have bad strategy, a roster that doesn't make sense, and play lackadaisical, it needs to be investigated!"
"Dude is ""him"" - the main character - and all the good and bad that goes with that"
I get that most players get upset when a killer pass or a finish doesn't go their way but I have seen such exaggerated reactions since Arsenal Giroud lol
*winks at the camera
Can't complain to the ref and press at the same time
That would be a sight to behold
Unless you're sexy sexy szobo
Bellingham is right in front of Pedri
Same here. But what a strike still.
Saw it coming from a mile away
Proper thunderblast setup that
Before he was even in the picture.
Just the fact is all started from Cubarsis brilliant tackle is beautiful
Man gathered all the Madrid players and then found a free pedri lol
They were practicing those shots from that kind of range just before start of the game. Probably felt like a drill to Pedri
Is that the one where he 2 defenders were diving at him?
Barca is the only club in the world where scouting 13 year olds to start on the 1st team in 4 years is something that happens regularly
"It's insane how much yamal has ruined people's perception of young players cause like Pedri is still basically a kid too, your team literally feels like a fm team when you throw a bunch of wonder kids in there it's actually kinda annoying lol"
Sorry I don't see Antony here
they're going to be so mad at the refs for that goal
Best player in the world*
Best player in the world
Best player in the world
Hes the best player full stop imo
Try being a United fan. You lot are spoiled rotten
">Journalists prefer strikers, it’s prolly gonna be raphinia tbh

Rodri literally won it last year"
"He is exceptional, but what about Vitinha? He makes a very impressive PSG team tick, a team that dominated and knocked out this season's CL favourite Liverpool"
https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pl/dictionary/english/irony
"Surely, unless of course they have a penchant for tapas with Jude, that might weigh heavily on them"
I think man city (at least in the past) always had really strong ends to their season. Where they would go a massive amount of games without a loss/draw for multiple seasons in a row.
#PEDRI I LOVE YOU
"I've seen Vini complain and roll at the same time, so technically it's a possibility"
"About the same distance Pedri ran to get in position for the goal, after making the (inch perfect) pass. What a player."
"Also, I think Pedri passed to Yamal so it's even better"
The kids are alright
"Yup, that banger."
He's basically a war veteran in this team at 22 years old lmao
"That’s because the generation of young players from 2003 to 2007 did it with who they were.

In the Barclays days, if you were good enough to play, you were old enough to get criticized"
Lucas Vazquez exists mate
That's harsh on Raphinha
That doesn't disprove his point though. No forward was a standout last year
Doesn't negate the fact
"Which isn’t too common. Out of the last 15 or so winners, 2 of them were attacking midfielders, 1 was a centre back, and 1 is a central midfielder. It could happen but we shouldn’t get our hopes up"
There wasn't a standout trophy-winning attacker though. Just compare Raphinha's season with Vini last year. Still think Pedri should get it though.
"Vitinha's been great and kinda my point. Dembele gets all the pr from psg, like raphinha gets for Barca. The midfielders deserve a lot more respect"
"learned something new today, thanks"
This is your brain on Madridball
Also about the distance to the nearest player pressing him
Barca academy is just unfair lol.
The quick 1-2
"He’s 22? Feels like he’s 26 already, that’s how long he’s been around."
Dude 90% of Barca fans would tell you that Pedri is undoubtedly our best player
Pedri is much more influential to the team than Raphinha
"Not really, all Barca will tell you Pedri is better and much more consistent"
If you watch Barça you’ll realise it’s really not
No it's not. Rapha has been a godsend this season but Pedri is the difference maker
Learn football
"No one wants to hear you moaning. You just sound like a petulant child when you say “I’m so tired of this season” when so many clubs suffer our fate or far worse. CL quarter final, cup final, and still a chance to win the league even if it’s small. The horror!! Everyone knows Madrid fans are the most spoiled bunch there is and you have just personified that notion single handedly. Enjoy the match my friend"
"He isn't from the academy, funny enough."
You think they'll split Ballon dor votes or will the club pick one to promote like Madrid 
"Indeed. Pedri has easily been our best player this season, with Lamine 2nd. Any Barça fan who knows ball will tell you the same."
100% true. It's night and day how well the midfield works when he's on vs off.
Barca fan here. Raphinha has had the better season overall but Pedri is peaking like mad right now.
They also won the Cl last year too. Spoiled fanbase
"Again, no forward was a standout last year. The bdor winner should have helped their team to at least one trophy"
Cole Palmer penalty compilation 🥶
"He scored like 50 goals in all comps, I’m pretty sure he did his job to help them win"
"He was not a serious candidate for the balon, let's be honest with each other"
"44 goals and 12 assists in the team expected to win the league, but not winning anything. Didn't turn up in the big games either 

Yeah he didn't deserve it"
"I didn’t say he was, but he definitely was an outstanding player last season that played the foward position."
So by that logic Salah hasn’t had a standout season?
Liverpool are about to win the Prem lol

"Valverde the only one running to even make an attempt to defend it, story of his life in Real. Man is gonna run himself out before he hits 30."
Pity it wasn't shown few seconds before that. When all the Madrid players in the box are watching Yamal but no one is aware of what's going on next to them and completely not seeing Pedri run to receive the ball.
Lot of credit to Yamal for dragging half the defence with him
"Something that will go perhaps under appreciated is the roll of that ball from yamal. 

So many balls have a slight bobble or such which makes it easy to sky over the bar.

That ball rolled like it was on a pool table.

Sensational finish and after passing it forward as well, was also well read and intercepted. Literally beautiful football start to finish"
why would the ref do this?
Unstoppable.
"Man, people these days, is it that hard to put a NSFW tag?"
Reminds me of Messi on that 3-2 el classico
How could the ref do this to real Madrid
why was no one tracking Pedri's run..... was it supposed to be bellingham?
Idk looks like a double touch
What a goalasoo
Revs fault !
Pedri is the best player in the world no cap
Cubarsi master save started this
Best in the world right now.
He knew straight away
"lets leave the best midfielder in the world wide open , fantastic gameplan."
He truly is Iniesta regen (plus Xavi)
The best of the world combine
You can’t even see bellingham from the back angle. Mf just stayed planted in the midfield
Absolute textbook.
Beautiful goal
Can I see an alternate angle of the Tchouameni tackle on olmo looked like a clear red
"Picking out that pass is fantastic but the weight of it sublime. Gave Pedri all the time to just stroll up hit it as clean as a whistle.   
Beautiful."
Iniesta 2.0
"Kounde also deserved, and Lamine too, but props to Ferran, he ran like possessed and maybe he'll raise his game for the big ones at the end of the season."
I need a YouTube shorts edit with the music behind it in slow motion asap
"I wish there was an angle from behind pedri, to see how much of a top bins it was and if Jude was still in shock that he's capable of misplacing a pass"
Lampard regen
Best player in the world.
Ballon d’or on the field tonight if Barcelona wins 2-3 trophies.
Pedriiiii ❤️❤️❤️
Pedriii ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This sort of goal used to be standard in the prem
Such a shame his engine is being wasted like this
"To be fair to them, they figured that Bellingham would track Pedri because both started in the same spot and hahahahahahahah jesus christ Jude."
Defence? He dragged everyone and their mother…
And Pedri for starting the attack!
I will try this roll on my Sunday league pitch and hope for the best 😎
"helps that the grass is fresh, and this is the 1st game on it."
"Wha a fucking strike man, when you can see the sheer pace on it even in a slowed down replay. Outstanding"
I know right? I saw this in the bus and now people around me are saying I'm a perv 😭😭
He gave the ball away and decided to just stand there with his hands on his head.
"People are coming at him for this, but I don't think so. They play with four midfielder, and Bellingham is the most advanced one. He should be between our attack and midfield. Tchouameni or Ceballos should have tracked this run, not him."
He got mogged by Bellingham today. 
"If Barcelona win the UCL (and HOPEFULLY pull off a third treble) there is so many players who would be worthy. 

Pedri, Raphinha, Yamal, Lewy to a slightly lesser extent. 

We are on the verge of a repeat of when the 3 finalists were Messi, Iniesta and Xavi.

What a team."
Over Salah's dead body.
And a bit of Busquets
No. Confirmation bias is at work.
I mean they are definitely making use of it lol they rely on him so much 
Least he’s won a UCL. Most players never get to say they have
"Come on.. look at his trophy room, one average season is not wasting him. Already won soo much more than some players can ever think"
"Being wasted on 3 league titles, 2 CLs, 2 Club WCs, and 2 super cups lmao"
he was busy deeply sighing over getting a very obvious pass intercepted
lmao that is somehow accurate
"I’m sure you’ll make that turf look like green glass mate, I’ve faith in you!"
That would definitely explain it as it looked immaculate almost like artificial turf at times
"that was ages ago. Plenty of time to track back, given that Pedri was nowhere near the bloody camera frame when Yamal was dragging defenders"
I see. I suppose it is complicated but anyone on their team would have saw Pedri make that run from far away and not a single player trailing him is abit confusing
Only thing Jude did was whine
"This goal started with a Bellingham giveaway, then a Pedri long ball with Bellingham watching rather than pressuring, and then a Pedri goal from a run that Bellingham failed to track.

I have to assume this comment is just purely trolling, but this play sums up how much better Pedri is than Bellingham."
I wouldn’t say Lewa or yamal deserve it. They have not been consistent enough. I think Pedri should get it over raphinha
"Salah is definitely not winning it. These days, your team has to win the UCL."
That’s an insane take.
"Not even close lol. 

Barca has multiple people in top 3/ top 5 in their position. 

No one undisputed though 

Salah vs lamal kvara 

Pedri vs vitinha vs barella 

Kounde vs hakimi 

Raphinha vs dembele vs vinicus 


Lewa vs Haaland"
"Are you trying to tell me what I do and don't know? I've been watching the English Prem since 96, I'm quite certain I know what I'm talking about."
"I should have been more specific, but you’re not wrong. I just mean if his teammates helped out more on defense his engine would still rock on well into the final minutes and that might help him link up with more attacking subs"
Have to make sure the cameras see him frustrated. The perfect Real Madrid player.
"Yeah, that’s my point. Ceballos was further up the pitch and made it back while Bellingham was not even in the picture."
"There were enough defenders there to stop the goal, too many defenders got sucked into Yamal. Bellingham not tracking back is your way of summing up their duel? Lmao completely and utterly delusional. Jude got the better of him slightly in the 1st half (despite Madrid being woeful) and ran rings around him after winning the ball off of him on at least 4 different occassions in the 2nd.

I have to assume this comment is just purely trolling, but anyone that actually watched the game could clearly see how much better Bellingham is than Pedri."
nah. Lewandowski deserves it. he’s in contention to be UCL top scorer and also running away with La Liga Pichichi. he may have underperformed here and there but numbers dont lie
I'm beginning to lean Pedri as well to be honest. I'm with you.
"It's insane to throw Lamal in there. Not because he doesn't deserve to be in the convo, but because the kid is still 17. He and Cubarsi are mind blowingly good for their age."
Yeah with more support he'd be even more effective for sure
"Ya ikr lol. 

At some point during the last 1 year the reality turned from he's so good for 17 years of age to he's so good."
"**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**

Koundé robbed
Honestly kounde deserves it imo. Not only for the goal but it seems he was everywhere on defense as well
FERRAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
kounde robbed
"Koundé has a real argument for this one, if he wasn’t top scorer of the competition this year don’t think he wins it"
"Nah, kounde was unbeatable and scored the golden goal."
"what the fuck? Kounde was the best player on the pitch by far, absolute wall in the defense and scored a winner in extra time???"
Inigo robbed
r/ferrantorresballondor collectively jizzing
Should’ve been Kounde
THE SHARK 🦈
Real Madrid TV just gave it to the VAR officials. who cares about this
MVP? Man of the match..
"How? lol. Even though he has a good game, Lamine should have got it."
"He was pressing like a DOG all to when he got subbed, exceptional performance"
"Thought it would be yamal, Martinez or kounde."
Lamine for me but the 🦈 showed up big time
r/FerrenTorresBallonDor 🦈🦈🦈
FerranBallonDior
My mom robbed!
"kounde, lamine, cubarsi all deserved it more"
His Ballon D’or clause might finally get activated this way
r/FerranTorresBallonDor will be celebrating!
"My shark is so sexy :3

(Shoulda been Kounde)"
"It's gonna be very hard for voters to decide between giving the Ballon D'or to Raphinha, Pedri, Kounde, or Ferran."
Inigo or kounde should've been MOTM imo
He was immense but have to be Yamal for me
??. I thought Yamal or Kounde were better.
"we might have 3 different players winning golden boot of laliga , champions league , copa del rey"
Cubarsi robbed . Bro stopped almost everything. No way he is just 18
"Ferran, enjoy the mvp my dude, absolutely not deserved but you’re going to be a champion today and that is what matters"
Yamal robbed
EL TIBURON SONG STARTS....!!!
Honestly should have been Lamine. Had two assists
Ref robbed smh
Should’ve been Bellingham smh
It should have been Kounde imo
"Kounde robbed hard, his extra time performance especially was heroic"
Iñigo Martinez robbed
"Kounde, Iñigo, Pedri, Cubarsi..."
[ten cuidado con el tiburón 🦈🦈🦈](https://open.spotify.com/track/5Zgj5ykx7yJQanQUdF9z5F?si=YEO8PG_9T_OowaE5bp7uhg)
"Uh dunno about that chief, I don't think he was even top3. Kounde clearly the mvp, then Cubarsi/Yamal probably."
"Ballon Dor winner🦈

Jokes aside, although I do believe Kounde was very deserving of it, Ferran really changed the tide and was the reason we even had a chance to win it all. Massive props for the man for stepping up in Lewy's place"
"Cubarsi, yamal and kounde robbed"
"I think it should have been kounde, but ferran keeping barca in just before full time to give barca a fighting chance, i can see why.

Still, kounde for me, but ferran's goal was critical"
Tralalero tralala
Lamine and Cubarsi clear .
"He deserves it. Important equalizer and he ends up highest scorer of the cup, just give the man the MVP."
"Kounde is getting deserved shoutouts but we also shouldn't forget Lamine with his 2 assists.

Was easily our best forward and made so much happen today"
It was for the tournament ig
Should have been Kounde or Brahim Diaz.
"The shark has been monumental this season, he is getting to Luuk De Jong status for me if he hasn’t beaten it"
They robbed my man kounde. He completely locked the lw despite Vini playing well and gave us the win after than brainfart from Modric and Brahim
Lamine with the two crucial assists should have got the MVP!
"Could’ve gone to a number of players, but I think Koundé was fantastic"
From memed player to clutch player. Even if he was not the mvp in my eyes. But hansi flick did change some players mentality
"Rigged, refs needs to be kicked out"
"Despite the lose, Bellingham won lot of duels and made many good forward passes in a bad Real team. He would deserved it"
Cubarsi for me. What a performance he had today!
"Kounde was EVERYWHERE from start to finish, fucking mental"
"Yamal for me, 2 assists and pressed all game."
He was kind of ball watching for their second goal. Otherwise he was good
"him, cubarsi, and inigo absolute wall"
If it wasn’t for him we would have conceded atleast 2 more
"Yeah, Ferran puttered out around second half. He wasn’t pressing when he should be and Madrid had time to look up at their advanced lines and pass, that was when Barca was getting pushed back. He was so burned out that he was also losing concentration pulling attacking actions off. That Pau Victor sub was so late.

Meanwhile Kounde was just tanking all the attacks through, his side was the safest, wheres the other side was faltering. And then you count his marauding run and decisive goal. He has to be it. (Aside from header he lost, everything was on point)"
Ferran deserved it but Kounde deserved it more. Striker bias. Simple as.
Wrong color
"Dude was stopping almost everything today, he was on fire."
"This is him when he gets one match of rest, brother is a machine"
He gave up the goal but made up for it
"Ferran was massive today though. He was intense when pressing, he held the ball, he created multiple chances, scored the equalizer. Kounde and Lamine also played great games."
Completely shutdown vini as well
"Ahí está (el tiburón) 

Ahí está (el tiburón) 

Se la llevó el tiburón, el tiburón (el tiburón)"
*Europa league theme intensifies*
"Barca as a team were just immense, dropped off a bit in the second half but 70% of the match they just bossed Real"
"There were great performances all over, plenty of players could have won it. Kounde was amazing in extra time, but was sloppy at times earlier in the game."
I love Inigo so much. He's 33 and still a fucking beast.
"Man, when I saw that indigo played left back all extra time, I was like, he is a real gangsta"
Tralalero tralala
"Oh we are. Believe me, we are"
Does ingoo play golf?
Kounde clears
Lamine relys heavily on raphinha making runs. Raphinha was assss
"Lamine had just a good one pass, he was invisible for the rest of the game. Martinez was solid though"
Watch the vote split unfavourably and fucking Dembele win it
Ferran might be the best attacker for Barca in this second half of the season. became an amazing player
Honestly the entire defence was good today except set pieces
Cubarsi Yamal or Kounde all of them deserved it. Gavi was amazing too but didn’t play much
"How come every day there is a new kid showing up at Barcelonas door, you need to be investigated lol"
Araujo as well
"Martinez for me, loved that he was telling off our players in extra time to wake the fuck up and start pressing. (That moment where Ferran and Lamine were holding hands and not moving back to position)"
Modric a shout for the assist
"I said it in his goal thread, he was precisely where he needed to be for 120 minutes. The corner goal was the only real blunder for Barca's defense."
"100%, incredible engine on him. It was 118', and he was still up there giving the defenders trouble on the ball. Right before the equalizer, he also had that shot that took a great save from Courtois to stop."
"Yeah, it seems him and inigo were everywhere.

Only inigo and kounde turned up till going 2-1 down"
"Bebé tiburón do do, do do do"
*Shiba Inu dog does several 360’s while there’s lightning in the background.*
In ET i expected Real to dominate but Barca outplayed them in both halfs of the ET
CB’s tend to peak later tbf. Can’t wait to see how Cubarsi developes.
Yeah. He had a great game. I think the only reason he did not get is because of the second madrid goal.
But the goal ferran got was from lamine pass as well though
I mean clearly he had at least 2 good passes given his 2 assists
He had at least 2 great passes that led to goals?
The fuck means invisible? He got 2 assists and had a lot of good passes throughout the match.
I think you’re mistaken. Lamine was blonde today.
2 assists in a final is a bad game for him yes
How about the passes that he put in the bounced across the box and no one got on the end of? Were they also not good?
That would cause me to very reasonablely crash out
at some point we had like 5 cbs on the field lol
Mbappe cooked Martinez ngl but he did well when he switched to LB
"Nah, Martin is ass"
Who’s the new kid you’re referring to right now?
Inigo was so fired up when we were down. He was screaming at *everyone.* Pretty awesome to see.
Loving this closed captioning
"> Can’t wait to see how Cubarsi developes.

if you want to see him at 33 years old you only have to wait like 15 years 💀 crazy how good good is he at 18"
6 if you count endrick
"I was truly confused by that but hey, it worked"
"All of then lol, look how young this team is with always somebody new coming up, anyone name Pau or ending in I is coming through this team and playing prime Iniesta lol"
Bruhhh lmao.
Pau Victor? He’s older than you think
"A shame Marc Bernal got a big injury a few games into his Barca career at the start of the season. He's 17 years old and looked like a legit Busquets regen. I hear the Fernandez cousins are amazing as well, guess we'll be seeing them next year."
"He looks like my 6 years old, I’m sorry I’m lost with all this talent you guys produce"
Saw him score 2 goals live against Real Madrid in preseason. My first Clasico I will never forget that moment or Pau.
"Pau is also dick in português, which makes it even more iconic"
Lmaoooo I gotta leave it in there now😂I forgot that tbh

He's been there since Cruyff i am pretty sure ....... Crazy

I THOUGHT HE FUCKED UP THE FINISH
Don't know what Courtois was doing there
Yamal is unreal and what a game this is

Lamine Yamal what the actual fuck?
Shark attack!!!!!!!!!!!
Incredible game
OMG THIS IS GETTING WILD
Wtf literally just heard people screaming 10 secs ago and already posted.
WHAT A PASS FUCK ME
SHARK ATTACK
Ferrantorresballondor
This is lowkey karma for Courtois always calling the team out for playing like shit. The ONE time the team shows up he fucked up. Can't make this shit up.
Holy fuck that is an insane pass
Madrid's fault for playing well and coming back too fast to get Madrid' themselves.
What a fucking pass!
Courtois giveth Courtois taketh
INJECT THIS SHIT INTO MY VEINS
FERRAN TORRES BALLON DOR FERRAN TORRES BALLON DOR FERRAN TORRES BALLON DOR!!!

Wtf is Courtois doing lmao
He is that guy
EL TIBURÓN 🦈🦈🦈
Rüdiger and Courtois???? What is you doing?
Tralalelo Tralala
fkin spoiled myself by refreshing reddit
"Hahaha nice, I really hope barca win this."
"It’s a very very small subset of professional players that think of doing that, at this level, in those circumstances and land it perfectly…perfection.

Cool and calm finish, too, obviously."
OOOOO MGGG BEST CLASSICO SINCE 2017
"Good guy, Courtois. Wanted some drama to end the game!"
100% on Courtois
Lamine is insane
"am bout to sh*t on him but SHARKKKK IS HIM!!!

Raphina s been sh*t since THAT Romario's interview."
Rare tibo howler
wtf cortouis??
Uncharacteristic from Courtois
"who'd have expected to get such an interesting, entertaining and close clasico after the previous ones thus far this season, wow!"
"FERRRRAAAAAAAANNNNN

Cue Europa League

WOOOOHHHHOOOOOHHHH

ABSOLUTE CINEMA"
That's your ballon d'or
Vinicus dude
Ball don't lie hijos de la grandisima puta
Randomly refresh and get spoiled that there's been a goal...
*Jazz music stops*
This is a great game.
Rudiger slide for show 💀
"he just runs directly to flick after he scores, so cute"
There’s been a report of a shark attack in Sevilla
That man again
MILF (man i love ferran)
Ferran Torres Balon D’or
FERRAN FUCKING TORESS
what a pass from yamal. what a finish
Classicos are getting good again
Shark attack! 🦈🦈🦈
Lamine is insane with his vision man
Insane just insane.... game's back
Holy shit what a ball and stop
GET FUCKKKKED REAL MADRID YOU CHEATING SCUMBAGS
Wtf did Courtois try to do there??
Let's fucking go. Wild ball from Yamal
"FERRRRAAAAAAAAAN 

Ahí está (el tiburón)
Ahí está (el tiburón)
Se la llevó el tiburón, el tiburón (el tiburón)"
The shark never rests
Yamal is the best player in the world atm
Tralalero tralala
"Lamine Yamal wtf, delicious ball"
Courtois didn’t need to be out like that
"The one guy I didn’t want in the highlights, ugh!"
What the fuck Yamal
THAT'S THE SHARK
THE SHARK FOR THE BALLON DOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This shit ain’t even happen for me yet wtf 😂
I’m having a phenomenal time as a neutral
Lamineee my goodness
Slapstick defending
"Deserved, we have been screwed over by the ref the entire game. Tchoumeni should be off by now and fuck Rudiger"
r/soccercirclejerk is about to have a meltdown
Brilliant pass from Yamal and Ferran timed his run to perfection!!
Hopefully rudigers last season with us
Courtois why? Why bro?
Please win shark we need you
Antony who?? Shark is the new GOAT
That pass tf
Lamine is INSANE
MY SHAAAARRRRK
El clasico !!!
Didn't last long.
Rudiger is injured and Tibo messed up
Rare courtois error there.
"Hate to say it but this one is on Courtois. No reason for him to come out like that, and he did so poorly.."
WHERE IS THE WEST HAM GUY THAT SAID WE WOULDN'T SCORE
90% of our attack is Lamine
LETS GO SHARK
Courtois totally misjudged this
Mistake from Courtois but Jesus what a ball. Tidy finish from the shark as well. What a game.
TIBURÓN ATTACK 🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈
Insane ball and Courtois with a gift
The shark!!! Rudiger should have tried to slide at the end but I guess too fatiquet/injured.
Where the hell is Brahim Diaz
"Open runner on the far post too, terrible defensive discipline, whoever picks up this Madrid squad will have a problem cleaning up this team in the defensive department."
He came out thinking Rudi had insurance 😢😢😢
WE DO NOT NEED A LEWA REPLACEMENT
This guy this year has been phenomenal! Might be his best season as a pro
This one is on Tibo.
"No need to even come out, Tibo cost us the game"
Get fucked you video making cheats!!
Insert Rio Fernando's Ballon D'or clip
What the fuck Lamine?
Chrissy: He was gay? Tibo?
Doing Casillas proud with that bit of goalkeeping.
MY SHAAAARK
Shark smelled blood first now returns the favour
Literally why did he come out
Suicidal decisionmaking
Would have been so easy but somehow made it look extremely difficult
It seems he rushed out because he was aware rudiger was injured and was trying to account for that.
That mistake cost us the game. Can’t believe it.
Yamal did a good assist
"Courtois giveth, Courtois taketh"
That was a certified Szczęsny moment
"Good guy, Courtois. Wanted some drama to end the game!"
*'God damn it I know one of you fuckers was pressing Triangle!'*
"Courtois is obviously a world class shot stopper, but these types of goals dont occur against modern sweeper keepers. A keeper like ederson or raya clean this up before it even becomes a problem"
He acted like an idiot
Perfect setting for the Shark Attack! 🦈
Ankara Yamal
Yamal is insane
Yamal is a cheat code man what the fuck was that. He's 17 and pulling off passes that took Messi years to perfect
Insane control too
Terrible goalkeeping.
it took forever to go in
"He did, but Rudiger can't run anymore."
Befuddled by the 🦈’s aura
Well it would be strange if he would be real wouldnt it?
yeah that was horseshit..... feed is still fucked up audio wise
How is that on Vinicius? Lmao
Rasheed Wallace should be so proud how his 3-word legacy has permeated every ball sport in the world.
Watch the match not reddit lmao
The ball drew him out. It was perfect
I always picture how the play would go in these kinda goals if the keeper stays. Ferran would be out wide being pressed by a defender running away from goal with almost no chance of scoring. I know it's easy to say in hindsight but they're such annoying ones to concede.
Doing his best Sanchez/Onana impression.
With none of the aura to bail him out come final whistle
Rudiger got on the right side of torres if only he had a keeper rhere
I've seen enough get this man a ballon dor
He sensed blood
Well Yamal has the advantage of having seen Messi do these. Beautiful exexution by Yamal.
Its a lot like the Alves to Suarez goal in CLassico ten years ago yeaar Barca won the treble
Do you think if the other RM defender (can't tell who it is) started sprinting back as Rudiger did he would've been in a better position to make a goal line clearance?
he cant string a pass tonight and they were 3v2 on a counterattack 30 sec before the goal
I just wanted to see the goals because I just started watching the match :(
it was a perfect ball for Torres' run but it was not an inviting one for the GK to come out for. Courtois is an unbelievable GK but a terrible sweeper keeper. Its just not his game
"What? The ball was going away from the goal, and Rudiger was on the inside of Ferran Torres. That was just straight up stupidity."
"Insane ball but still, Rudiger is right on his ass. Need to trust Rudiger to at least make it a very difficult shot there"
"Perfect ball but he hesitated
Either trust the cb or go for it "
"Exactly. If you want to be super critical, then every goal is a result of a mistake of at least one player from the opposing team, but this was more of Yamal's incredible pass than Courtois' mistake. But Real Madrid fans try to cope by downplaying the pass and putting it on GK's mistake."
"perhaps Raphina is also there for a square ball - but looks like he would have been covered

that’s the only excuse I could see for Courtois here"
There’s definitely something to that y’know!
Yamal = Kakshi confirmed
Good lord that was a decade ago?
"Maybe, but i think better choice is to mark Raphinha from getting cross and the situation should be cleared by Rudiger or Courtis, but the latter decides to leave for a smoke."
"Fair enough, find a stream and don't come back until after the goal :D"
"If you want to be super critical, then every goal is a result of a mistake of at least one player from the opposing team, but this was more of Yamal's incredible pass than Courtois' mistake."
"Are you blind? The ball was DEFINITELY not going away from the goal. Ferran's touch took it away from the goal but by that time, Tibo already had committed.
 
If you want to be super critical, then every goal is a result of at least one player's mistake but this was more Yamal's incredible pass than Courtois' mistake."
Rudiger has been mediocre this season
I’m not saying he didn’t make a mistake. Just that he was forced into making the choice.
Still need to trust your CBs
He's been okay considering his teammates in defense have been midfielders or newly promoted academy players and he's had no rest. He's also been playing with a few knocks for a while now

Unc is 12 shots deep. Go on Unc
He's a hard hustler
hustle_hard_304 is so based
His post when Yamal scored that golazo in the euros solidified this guy as a top tier shit poster
Level-headed take 😂
Can't argue with that.
Absolutely terrifying that I'm older than the DAD of one of the best players in the world.
"If he was a Madrid fan, his favorite player has to be Figo lol"
Barca feeds him good
too many cervezas?
Pretty sure it’s your son feeds you.
"Ooof, damn."
Don’t bite the finger that uh fingers you
Man this bloke looks far too young to be the dad of one of the world’s best footballers.
This brudda is gone
Fair enough
"“My son is better than messi, I don’t care”

-hustle_hard304"
Agent Mounir it's time to recreate Figo
"Don't know much about this guy but he kinda sounds like a leech here. Even if he isn't hat's just not a smart thing to say knowing his kid is probably gonna hear it. How can he expect his son continuing to respect him and heed his advice when he says stuff like that publicly. Even if Lamal supports his father financially, it shouldn't be acknowledged (especially publicly) as it completely changes the father-son dynamics."
"Oolp, any link?"
I don't think so. Lamine does all his cooking on the pitch.
Reportedly he is younger than lewandowski
Unvote hahah
"It’s really a nothing burger. As long as his relationship with his kid is good, I doubt the kid minds taking care of his dad."
"Lamine by all accounts listens to his mother more than his father.

She is the one that pushed for him to stay at Barcelona."
"My guy, a lot of players support their parents financially. It's not exactly an uncommon thing, especially considering that A LOT of players come out impoverished families. 

That being said, I think he was mainly making a joke here. Since he used to be a Madrid fan, but I cant imagine that being a very feasible thing if your son is like the best player in their rivals team and keeps beating them."
Man who cares what team a players parent supported
[HustleHard304](https://xcancel.com/AnabellaMarvy/status/1851909634283446767)
Its not that serious bro
This is it [from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/HQZnLM4OXF)
Can't post Twitter links
"I don't. It's not about the teams, it's about parent-child power dynamics. There's many stories about nouveau riche teenagers & young adults (athletes, music stars, actors) having their good relationship with parents destroyed by money, because their family members are seen (rightly or wrongly) as leeching of them."
"Thx. I love this [photo](https://xcancel.com/667Kobe/status/1851961416313356761#m) too, in the replies"
Not sure why people act like I called him a bad father. He's not (afaik). All I'm saying is it's really fucking hard to parent a 17 year old who pays your bills.
"Ah, I hear u. No worries

If possible, just change the x dot com part to xcancel dot com. It bypasses twitter's annoying no account bs policy so all replies are also visible"

"He's ridiculously good, when you consider he's just 18 it gets even crazier"
He really is. The ability to be so focused at his age damn near every time whenever they play Flick's high line and do it well is incredible.
"That Iniesta hairline don't lie, comeback soon Marc."
He made us go 1-0 with that insane tackle. 
"I’ve never seen a center back so good at such a young age. Maybe people old enough to have seen young Maldini can weigh in, but personally I’ve never seen anything like it"
"He’s basically a midfielder playing at cb at this point with an absolutely mad aerial game, genuinely absurd passing range and ability to pull it off too"
"He’s not just an accurate passing defender too, he is a brickwall that has withstood firing. How many times has he stood in the way of worldclass players like Vini, Mbappe and the like? 

Lamine gets all the limelight, but Cubarsi is a real deal too, at the same level I would say. But because he’s a defender he doesn’t get the same level of attention. 

Edit - Cynically and selfishly, I hope it stays or at least his stardom grows much slower than Lamine, it’s good for Barca to keep cost down."
Unbelievable performance from him today
"Cubarsi is genuinely a generational talent 

The amount of through balls he tackeld tonight is fucking insane"
Future Captains
"I don't remember any player being one of the best CB-s in the world at 18...

  
He is just amazing."
Guy looked liked Prime Pique except he’s 18…mental mental talent
These kids make me so happy man 😭
[Casado is so lovely lmao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfhZ1zgib5k)
"Had a legitimate claim to the MotM trophy. And then you remember he's basically the same age as Lamine Yamal.

Just ridiculous for his position."
Being a star CB for one of the best teams in europe at 18 is as outrageous as what Yamal is doing
Counter terrorist win
What a dear
He has the potential to be Barça's Maldini.
"Kinda looks like Carlos Alcaraz, this guy"
Bigger talent than Lamine
So so good happy new year
"The Spanish NT have the potential for an incredible pairing of Cubarsi and Ascensio. The latter hasn't seen as much game time yet, but whenever I watch him, he seems rock solid."
"Scary how young this team is, they can rule for the next 10 years if healthy. Scary scary stuff"
"His performances are also so consistent, never drops below a 7/10"
"We really got a teenager as a nailed on starter in defence for one of the best teams in the world. This guy looks like an absolute veteran going against the best strikers in the world. Kane, mbappe, vini, lautaro next. Anulo cubaressi"
A literal teenager at that. Even araujo hasn't completely been indoctrinated in flicks system
That midfield is beyond stacked once they come back. Pedri Frenkie Olmo Gavi Fermin Casado Bernal Torre
also saved us many times during extra time with insane interceptions
"Maldini is basically the only one that comes to mind, but he played as a fullback at young age. Cubarsi is on a good track to become the GOAT CB but it is way way way too early to even think about that. Best of luck to him, great player and great kid, never a dirty moment from him !"
"I know a lot of people won't agree,  but Marquinhos was ridiculous when he was young.  I know chosing PSG put him out of people's mind, but he's been great since he was about 18."
"De Ligt in his first seasons at Ajax easily. That's also why I need to see him continue this level for a couple more years, I have been burned too much when buying into the hype too early"
"Not quite to the level of starting at Barca, but Saliba was the arguably the best CB in Ligue 1 at 19."
He’s a proper proper defender. The way he intercepts passes is insane
"La masia genetic lab:
“Hmm… What if we merge the DNA of pique and busquets into one player “"
According to capology Cubarsi is already making more than Lamine though.
It’ll probably be Cubarsi-Huijsen tbh. He’s stylistically the perfect partner for Cubarsi
La masia saved you guys so hard. It’s honestly crazy how bad with money your club has been over the last 10 years.
One? We got multiple
">Anulo cubaressi

what does this even mean lol"
"Araujo is bad on the ball. He just needs to learn to pass it to martinez and curbasi and he'll be good. Doesn't need to do those bad passes then he can focus on where he's actually good, shuttinf down attackers."
"Bro don’t forget Quim Junyet, Flick has a headache to deal with and then the Fernandez cousins. What a time"
casado over de jong for me
I remember being pissed PSG snagged him from Roma instead of Barca
"De Ligt was 19 during that Ajax UCL run though. At 17 he was just making a few appearances at the top level. At 18 he had only played in CL qualifiers, and only made his first proper CL appearances at 19. Cubarsi has been performing well against some of the best attackers in the world since he was 17"
"Cubarsi is on an adult contract, Lamine not yet, but soon enough. Lamine’s wages will surely blow past Cubarsi’s."
"Can't believe I blanked out on him. Either way, Spain is fucking set."
Huijsen actually impressed me so much against the Netherlands. He took the boos and the usual dirty Dutch play like a champ and played extremely solidly.
"Can't believe we aren't in the race to sign him, especially if Araujo leaves. We sign him and that's out entire back four set for at least the next decade."
Tebas is currently looking into banning Barca from promoting youth players
"You really have the regens for Messi, Pique and Iniesta in your team lol."
From your own academy no less. Fucking bonkers.
"That's the thing. Cubarsi and inigo are elite in distribution, reading the offside line and absorbing pressure. Funny thing is one's 33  and the other's 18"
"It’s not hard to learn to pass sideways or back, the issue is Barca has one fewer outlet. Opponents know what to expect and can take advantage of that. 

But then again, for what he lacks, he has other strengths that all his other defending teammates don’t have. Total man-to-man dominance and a higher chance of recoverability if opponents break past.

It’s a good to have variety at your hand."
Gonna be hard cause that Pedri Frenkie partnership is elite. 6 months ago id have 100% agreed with you. What a good problem to have lol
"That's gonna be difficult next season, if Flick prefer Bernal over Casado earlier this season there is a chance that he's genuinely better than Casado."
Flick disagrees.
"Good it’s only for you, because Flick and rest of the world have eyes

Frenkie benched Casado"
"He was a nailed on starter at 17, played the euro Cup final at 17 and was overall captain at 18. The comparison is definitely there."
"Not quite right, De Ligt was captain at 18."
Wait until Bernal comes back lmao. I'm very excited for him to be back next season after that terrible injury.
"Pretty different player than Pique imo. Doesn’t have the physicality and strength of Pique (he’s also 18 and not even a fully grown man yet) and he’s also probably not as good of a passer nor has Pique’s penchant for goalscoring. But at 18 he has much better temper, decision making IQ, on-ball skills and especially **positioning** than Pique had at his age, and in some of those skills than Pique maybe ever had. Thinking about Pique playing in Flick’s scheme makes me shiver, he’d constantly get caught out of position by faster strikers and would be the one to fail to do the offside trap more often than anyone in the defensive side. I think Pau might also be faster than Pique."
Araujo is moving this summer right?
Pretty sure this is what PSG were doing to him last year when he made that dumb tackle. Instead of pressing him hard they cut off his outlets and forced him into making poor passes. One of those passes lead to a counter attack in which he did his dumb shit and got himself sent off.
yeah being a barca fan and going throught many shitty years makes these times a lot more sweet
"Frenkie is a liability when overwhelmed though, and his best position was under Koeman with his runs and linkup play. Imho he’s not cut for the current one he has, although it’s been forced on him due to injuries."
"He is overall from what I've seen. I believe he's a Yamal, Cubarsi level talent"
"If Flick says so, who am I to say no. I trust Flick with my life"
"I keep promoting this guy to my friends like I get paid for it 🤣

He comes back, we sign a starter no.9 to replace Lewa (due to age and the inevitable him moving on in the next 2 seasons) maybe a left/right back who can help with the rotation and Barca is good next season as well."
">not as good a passer 

Mate his best attribute imo watching him week in week out his passing. He’s able to pass the ball through the lines with such ease it looks routine. That’s what blew me away when he first broke through last season."
I think that was the plan when he extended this season. Not sure what he ends up doing now that he's lost his starting place
Probably. Although I think he might stay for another season since a proper preseason can actually help him integrate in the system. His ball playing is his only issue. He has been massive in games like yesterday where he was great
"From having dest depay Nico abde mingueza starting, to this. What a turnaround"
Flick preferred Frenkie over Casado long before he got injured though.
You're mistaken. It's not been forced on him due to injuries. He had already benched Casado before Casado's injury. Because he's better.
"And i fucking love how flick nurses the players back into the team , was worried how gavi might end up after returning , but damn today he blowed my mind what a shift from my man as well ."
"You might have not watched Pique in his prime, he was a legit playmaker from the back. I also said “probably” so I’m not saying Pique washes him, I think Pique at his prime edges out the current version of Pau as a passer, which shouldn’t be controversial at all."
That depends on him. If he can improve his passing then he will be great
"Gavi has been getting a lot of disrespect lately. I think it's Pedri's fault, because he's so good the bar is in heaven. But Gavi IS a genius. There's a reason he won the golden boy and broke out so early"
"I watched pique’s entire Barca career love the man to death. Pique is better at sending lofted long ball over the top than Curbasi or spraying the ball out wide. but Curbasi’s ability to split the midfield and break the press with inch perfect through the middle on the ground has been incredible to watch each week. He takes more risks than pique in that aspect of passing, but pique in my opinion was definitely better with the ball at his feet and carrying the ball forwards."
"Before his injury, when he was playing consistently, he was getting better at both carrying and passing. I think he just needs rhythm and a preseason to drill in his spot as a consistent rotation (Martinez is not getting any younger, and is consistently in need of rest)."

"999th minute? Man, RM TV got him to add some crazy injury time."
"This is worded in a way that Im certain the association will take an extremely strong response to Rudiger. Im certain they’ll take a very close look at this, especially seeing as how frequently he instigates and the overall Real response. All that is to say, I look forward to the very firm 1 game suspension with a strongly worded announcement. Meanwhile the Jude and Vazquez reds rescinded after RMTV releases a genealogical investigation into the head ref, a 3 hour expose into every transgression from every ancestor. 
  
I doubt Real will ever behave the same way again."
 Soooo why no red for Vini too? He did literally the exact same thing as Vasquez
"It does not get talked about enough but Bellingham's antics and character have fallen off a good chunk this season. Cursing at refs? Making countless foul worthy tackles? For someone tasked to be a captain? These are piss poor antics. Before someone brings up age, I am not seeing this from Cubarsi or Yamal, both younger than Jude."
Vini manages to slip away again huh
Surprised Vini wasn't sent off too
So when do we hear about punishment's or are we going to get the typical slap on the wrist towards Madrid?
But was Jude's aggressive attitude respectful?
The club as a whole needs to be punished. RMTV played a role in how these players acted tonight. It was a disgrace.
"Considering match bans depends on what refs write on their report I would guess:

1 match ban for Vazquez

2-3 matches for Bellingham

5-10 matches for Rüdiger"
If Rudiger plays again this season it’s a fucking joke. Psychically throwing stuff at any member of the ref team should be a lengthy ban
"""without reaching me"" 💀"
999 minutes and no remontada.
Tbh If bellingham was capable of controlling himself for 870 minutes after ft a red is unfair
Where is the red for Vini? He did the same as Vazquez.
"There’s a sense of entitlement from Madrid players. Those players easily lose their cool. I get it, you don’t want to lose 3 times in a season to your biggest rivals but to have to be restrained by teammates because you want to physically assault the referee is absurd. Those players need a crash course in learning to control their emotions."
"Anyone with actual knowledge on the rules that could shed some light on this and say how many games they could be suspended for? Rudiger probably won't play for the rest of the season. Bellingham will get a couple of games at least, right?"
Ahh yes we played for 999 minutes
Why is no one questioning Ancelotti? Man seems to have given players the licence to do whatever they want
Well surely then Rudiger is getting a lengthy ban right? the way this is worded tentative to assault the referee should be between 12 and 30 games should it not?

"In fairness, if I had to play 16 hours of high-level football and lost, I wouldn’t blame Bellingham for that reaction. He’d be going postal at that point. /s"
"Vinicius came onto the pitch as well and did all the things Vazquez did, why wasn’t he sent off?

Oh yes, because he’s their golden boy and sending him off would mean that Florentino personally would make sure the ref would never be seen in a first division game again. 

Absolute bunch of wankers. Trying to pressure the ref all week, got every single decision in their favour and then end up acting as if a tremendous injustice has befallen them. 

Never has a team of players been more dislikable. Special mention to Bellingham, Vinicius and Rudiger, the psychopath."
999th minute - that's impressive commitment waiting 16 hours to hassle the referee.
Vini so lucky not getting red.
They just ain’t that good and are blind to see it
Half the Madrid team should be getting at least a 5 match ban
Bellingham is looking less and less like a potential ‘hero’ for England
This week I have realised more than ever - what an awful and entitled club Madrid are.
Weak ass bitch CF. OOOOHHhh so scaryyyy you can yell and threaten and harass the refs... Deserves ultimo respecto...
"Wild only one was booked for throwing, whilst there were obviously 3."
"That's my ref, not intimidated by idiotic hate compilations"
Wouldn't have been a red if it had reached ...
I'd be mat too if the game went as long as 999 min.
999th minute. did they just throw a number out of the blue?
"Real Madrid is an absolute disgrace of a team. An absolute desecration of 15 UCLs, this owner-supported toxicity cannot stand any longer.

  
Ironic they are considered the best team of all time but then you act unprofessional like this, smh"
The pre-match press-conf was the gas that lit this fire up.. If that press-conf didn´t happen game would have been less controversial
"Some proper Scrappy Doo, hold me back energy from Bellingham"
Real Playschool FC. What a bunch of babies. They make Man City seem likeable.
Real Madrid must be the biggest cry baby club ever QQ
"I must've fallen asleep as I don't remember no 999 minute, let alone a red card in it."
He’s gonna start crying again
999 minutes and we have to play Inter this week!  disgrace!
I wonder if it's just a placeholder for a post-game offence.
999 minutes and still couldn’t score
120 minues are a long time in Sevilla
and I thought 90 minutes was a long time only at Bernabeu
"Still didnt manage to score 😤 Ancelotti out! 

(heard ten Hag is available? 💀)"
"No longer Fergie time. 

{bufferOverflowTime}"
It sounds better when you read 999 in Terry Crew's voice
Lmao had me at first
I hope so. This whole thing is so extremely embarrassing and shitty. Fuck Perez and the board.
"Did you know in school this refs friend forgot to do their homework, the teacher forgot to collect it and he didn't rat him out. 

This shows a clear pattern of bias and lying"
And not wearing a band. League must have a clause that he cant be booked for dissent given hes the biggest whiny bitch match in match out.
"He didn’t stray quite so far onto the pitch but nonetheless very fortunate. Maybe not wearing the bib helped him look like he belonged.

Also, Vasquez did two fist shakes. That's twice as many!"
Because he just wants to play football. Duh.
That's racist
Its because he just wants to play football
Cause he is black
Bellingham spent too much time complaining and asking for calls rather than getting on with playing the game. Really petulant.
He‘s had these tendencies at Dortmund already… Def gotten a lot worse/more tho
"Former teammates talked about how he was a bit of a self-absorbed cunt before too, but that was sort of expected from an ambitious footballer, he carried himself well on the pitch at least."
"the club itself is like a hive mind that turns everyone who goes there into a whiny entitled baby, i saw carvajal was cussing out the ref as well"
In the two matches against Arsenal I really noticed just how dirty and petulant he gets when things aren't going his way.
Assaulting innocent defenseless VAR monitors
"He has always had a short temper. I remember after he lost to Chelsea at Dortmund, instead of shaking hands with the players he went out of his way to go and provoke Cucurella, pushing him for absolute no reason. Also in the same post match he slams his water bottle on the turf and proceeds to drag away the camera equipment from the poor cameraman who is only doing his job of filming the players. He is incredibly childish, and seems to not have matured much since with hindsight of what he did to the Arsenal players last week, and how he acts off the camera. Although, nobody truly cares because he is extremely PR trained and good looking, so average football consumers don’t care about his antics or demeanours. I remember anytime an English match was played during the summer, his name was the highlight even though he had a poor tournament to his standards, but the media don’t care as long as any action he does that is good he gets overpraised for it. Here is the link to the source footage: https://youtu.be/tGFJWvf0Tpw?feature=shared"
"This is nothing new, he was already unbearable in Dortmund, the moment it wasn't going his way.

The English press just kept glazing him, no matter what."
He’s a wanker
He was always terrible. English fans just shielded him for a long time. Although I do think since he moved to Madrid he has gotten 3-4x worse.
"Real Madrid organisation encourages such behaviour constantly, just look at RMTV. At Barça, with Flick, he’d never allow youngsters to get corrupted like that."
real madrid virus? hehehe
"Jude is a diva and both coaches and media always allowed it. I'm glad Flick didn't instill that to Barca's young players, not too long ago Piqué, Alba or Busquets used to bitch for whole matches, but the current team just keeps their head down and play."
He has gotten a lot worse compared to his time with us
This season?
Well that’s the attitude that modern day Real Madrid breeds the longer he’s there the worse it will get.
Real DNA had taken over
What going to Madrid does to a mother fucker… 🤷‍♂️
This is what happens when you play for real. His ego was big when he was at Dortmund but I would say it was more balanced than it is now. he now is surrounded by people who are also complaining about every little thing and now he is able to express it without facing consequences in the club
As far as I know he was already like that at Dortmund but obviously now he has more of the spotlight.
"He’s a petulant child, it’s crazy how far a player drops off when they join Madrid. It’s part of the entitled culture of the club"
He was like that at Dortmund aswell
he was always a cunt. he just knows his way around interviews very well and therefore seems likeable.
"Totally agree. It’s easy to get caught up in it, especially when you’re young. Hope he finds some maturity, though I doubt Real is the place to do that."
Dortmund's squad were glad to see the back of Bellingham for a reason
Watching the game vs arsenal I noticed how much of a dirty cunt he was towards arsenal players and I'm like that's your national teams teammates. I'd be pissed if I was rice or saka.
"Cubarsi and Yamal have everything going for them right now tho. They're in heaven. It's not the age, it's the frustration."
"He came into Real humble and worked hard and was amazing. So amazing it got to his head, now he thinks he's better than everyone and instead of working hard he expects it. And when it doesn't come he becomes a whiny bitch. Or maybe the whiny bitch syndrome was passed onto him after one season at Madrid."
Dele Alli 2.0
He did literally the each same things as Vasquez.  Their motions were even synced up 😂
Refs Dont wanna appear in a documentary
Cuz he'd cry racism
Right wasn't he right next to Vasquez on the pitch?
was he already on yellow?
Others probably will but i dont think Rudiger is getting away with this one
Will probably miss one game against a 3rd division team next season.
Did he say thank you?  -JD Vance Bellingham
He wanted to throw and even bigger chunk of ice. Proper bully.
"According to rules 

Rudiger’s suspension can go upto 30 matches"
3 months for Rudiger if RFEF follow their own precedent - Dani Benitez was given 3 months for throwing a water bottle at the ref.
"I would take that personally without Bellingham the league classico should be some light work and we need some of that after these intense fixtures


Rudiger was already playing with an injury I guess ?"
“He threw it like a little bitch”
"It's been an incredibly irritating season, especially given that our players seem to just lose their head every week. Mbappe trying to break Blanco's leg, Jude cussing out a referee once again now, Rudiger being an absolute menace week in week out, and half the team showing the winning mentality of a death row inmate.

There's a lot of fixes that need to be made, and it's honestly unfortunate Carlo had to finish his tenure at Real trying to babysit some of these egos."
"Rudiger 5-8 games. 

The others 1-3 games. My guess is just 1 game, even though I dont know what Bellingham said. 

Rudiger I think they will make a example of, because throwing shit is pretty unacceptable. So should be done for the season, no doubt."
"Anything under 4 match bans will only affect next years copa. Rudiger, as per the referee act, should totally miss the rest of the season in laliga"
Former referee Eduardo Iturralde did say on Cadena Ser that for Rüdiger it should be a suspension of 4-12 games in La Liga. Vazquez and Bellingham 1-2 games but only for Copa next year since it was less severe
They'll probably miss 1 match. That's it in all honesty
Sure as hell felt like it
"It's the Madrid mentality. They've always been like it. Look at someone like Pepe, he should have been in prison for half the stuff that he did. 

You saw it against Arsenal at their ground, Carvajal confronting Saka for how he took a penalty.

I wouldn't be surprised if Vini claims the ref was racist, that's his go-to."
"I'd say 8/10 games minimum. Not so sure about Bellingham though, because at least, as far as I know, we don't have images on how aggressive he was against the referees. But with Madrid you never know!"
"Maybe he will issue a public apology and all will be forgiven, after all we don’t want any mini madridistas to bully the referees kids on the play ground anymore"
"He was still just in full kit, so ref might have missed it in the chaos since it is slightly less obvious"
You know he's sleeping with a smile tonight 😉
Tonight only one fan base is crying very loudly 😂😂
"Definitely, I can't realistically imagine anything else."
But barca didnt score either. Kudos to the defense 💪
999 minutes is definitely a long time
"He‘d miss every other game lol, can’t have that happen to one of the star players of the league I guess"
Booking Vini is racist
When has he cried about racism without any incident of racism? Why does this keep getting upvoted on the sub? You're all fucking racists. And I say this as someone who doesn't like Vini and wanted Barca to win.
That’s not what this says?
Vinicius and him feed off each other
Carvajal is such a prick. He shouldn’t be anywhere close to the pitch if he’s not in the squad
All were inside jokes towards some friends in the stands.
I remember that one clip of some young Barca player who accidentally stepped on Flick’s seat in the dugout. The stare Flick gave him was crazy.
"Eh, Raphinia had to be restrained versus Betis and was getting aggressive with Flick and Ter Stegen"
"There is a big difference. Dele had mental health problems going back to his childhood. Bellingham just seems to have a piss poor attitude, BUT not a bad work ethic"
It looked like they're doing a haka dance.
"“Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea, welcome to your tape.”"
Didn't vini get red before? Did he cry racism? Even as a lifelong barca fan it is disheartening to see people mocking a serious issue
"Why the fuck is this upvoted? Has Vini really cried racism when it wasn't racism? I haven't seen it. He is a whiny cunt and even I don't like him that much but from what I've seen, he doesn't cry racism when it's not there."
"You people are pathetic, he has literally never done that. It's interesting to me just how many people make comments like this whenever vini does something they don't like, they can't simply criticise his behaviour they have to denigrate the very real issues with racism that he faces, clowns the lot of you."
typical bayern fans being racist
"I am convinced anyone using this line of argument is either being obtuse on purpose, or are closeted racists. 

When has Vini ever cried racism without an actual incident of racism? Let me answer that for you - Never! 

You do understand he has gotten cards before, including red. And he never blamed ref for racism over those cards! So I don't see why this narrative keeps popping up over and over."
"He was in the match t-shirt not the bib though, likely ref just missed it (?)"
Idk they might take into account that jude already got a red for dissent this season
"Absolutely not. There's a smoking gun (well, water bottle!) and there's no way anyone can gloss over this one. Given the Real antics this week, any leniancy will  just encourage Madrid and most likely force the the referees to go on strike,"
He's just going for the ball with his water bottle and missed. 1 game suspension
"Surely Rudiger gets at least 3 games. Throwing stuff at the referee is ridiculous. 

We've already practically lost the league, what's one more player out?"
Yeah. He might get a 2 game suspension instead of stern words
Why didn't he wear a suit?
He‘s wearing white so the „up to“ is not relevant. What is the minimum?
"That would be fucking great to see, he's such a prick."
30 years would be fair.
considering we are at season end and 2 of those 3 month will be a break anyway it should be 20-30 matches instead.
"Babysitting, and correcting, those egos is the managers job."
"Not sure about Bellingham because we don't have images, but if he had to be restrained by his teammates... Let's see what happens."
"He’s def out for the season, this is some NHL shit and even that gets a 50 game ban"
Under 4? I thought it was under 2?
">I wouldn't be surprised if Vini claims the ref was racist, that's his go-to.

When has he claimed racism without being abused?"
Yeah he’s very happy with the result
I’m not crying. I knew we were going to lose
There it is.
"Let's calm down, lol. The referee probably just missed him/Maybe he didn't say anything egregious as vasquez. Joking like this about racism isn't cool"
"Completely agreed, I really dislike Vini/Real myself but his complaints about racism in Spain and racist behaviour from fans are valid. Disappointing to see people make excuses for it here."
"> You're all fucking racists

You're kinda proving his point there"
Vini has actually been pretty good recently. He only complains when it's a genuinely bad decision and when the whistle is blown at HT or FT. Meanwhile Bellingham has been getting mad and just stopping at his and his teammates' mistakes
Well I mean it’s not like he was down pitch side interfering with the opposing team’s player mid match or anything….oh wait
Legit dad stare.
"Forgot about that, that outburst was weird as fuck. The days of massive complaining to any ref seem to be far away though (but since Madrid/Barça is a neverending cycle, they'll eventually go back to that)."
"True, but mental health condition doesn't excuse poor conduct. All the more reason for players to get their own mental health assistance to help them cope with their issues and even to spot underlying problems.

Acknowledging bad behaviours and owning up to it is a first step towards improvement. Mental health condition or not, it is important for someone to be in control of how one speak and behave. Those who struggle with this, will struggle to fit into society.

People struggling with mental health condition don't need our pity. They need a way out."
Seriously. Even I don't like Madrid but racists on this sub will defend anything if it is said against the club/player they hate.
"Vini speaks out against racism as and when it’s required, and also yes it does happen frequently with him.

He’s also a massive cunt who’s a whiny bitch and very unlikeable in general.

He’s gonna get trolled on for everything he does because of point no. 2."
This is a thing in Spain afaik. He is recidivist so probably will get quite a few games
"I know people like to jerk around and say 1 game ban, but he will likely get (deservetly so) at least 2-3 months."
"Only if the suspension is >=4 carries to another domestic competitions, in this case, laliga"
"He succumbed to the bullying of the fascists and his kid hopefully won't be bullied anymore. 
He should smile."
"Yup, only takes a couple of comments in a Vini thread for all the racists and racism apologists to come out of their caves."
This always happens on this sub. People are just so blinded by hatred that they will actively choose to not see any reason and would rather act like illiterate buffoons who don't have a clue about racism and its effects.
"So you mock him for something that he has suffered through the years and has never used as a shield. He has stood up and spoken up for Yamal as well. He has never cried racism or blamed racism for getting a red card, has he? So pointing it out is proving the point now? You're all racists."
"> Vini has actually been pretty good recently

Did we watch the same clip ? You can't say that with a straight face in THIS tread lol"
Wasn't vini as aggressive as vasquez in the same clip?
How can you be so sure of yourself yet so completely unaware of what it means to have a mental health condition?
Trivializing the very real issue of racism in the game and in the world at large is not simply trolling.
"Using a real and deep rooted issue that directly affects Vini and many other people, to mock him, is not simply trolling. It's more like playing down the issue and making fun of Vini for fighting against it."
"> He’s gonna get trolled on for everything he does because of point no. 2

No he's gonna get trolled on because racists are massive bellends and refuse to listen to anyone calling out their actions. If he had not been a massive cunt people would be dunking on him as well.

If Mbappé would start calling out racism the reaction on this sub would be exactly the same (""victim complex"")."
"That is ridiculous, racism is a real and serious issue not something to ""troll"" about but it wouldn't surprise me if these people simply think his fight against racism is unjustified and probably thinks he deserves it because they don't like his attitude as a player, absolutely ridiculous."
R. Madrid will probably appeal and say there is a mistake in the ref's report (999Min) and therefore it's null and void.
Fascist 😂 you don’t even know what that word means. Just throw it around like you know.  He’s very happy because he helped his team win.
"Shut up, alphabet baby"
"EXACTLY. These aren't even jokes, just straight up racism being upvoted by hundreds and thousands of people. It's fucking crazy out here."
mildly impressive. Does he just not know what happened to Dele or what
"Football is a sport where the lines between trolling and trolling in poor taste are blurred.

Not condoning it, just what it is."
That's clearly a placeholder value meaning the game was complete once the incident occurred
Maybe that's how they note after game incidents.
"I'm a brown Muslim living in Spain.
I know what fascism means, more than you'll ever know.

Shame on you."
"I hated what Madrid did before the game. I hated what Rudiger, Vazquez, and Vini were doing on the sidelines but people out here casually defending and justifying racism and mocking him for taking a stand against it. How are these people not closeted racists?"
"People are right to pile on the embarrassing behaviour of the club and several players, but it’s also glaringly obvious how then people just use the opportunity to claim absolutely outrageous things with zero merit. The state of discussion has never been lower and just shows how many people are just moral posturing on several issues."
"I understand that, although I might not completely agree but I get that point.

Anyway, I was just looking for reply from one of these bozos because I have seen some people push this narrative seriously too. Like a user in another thread claiming ""The issue is that he calls for racism both when it is present and when it is not"". But obviously, they never reply."
"The number of people who have made comments like ""He is such a dirty player and a whiny cunt. He deserves being racially abused"" is truly disheartening to see."
"Is this him or his agent talking?

Rudiger has this a lot, I think he has problems."
1 match suspension incoming.
Well written from his social media team! Really feel so sincere and straight from the heart...
"""here is my excuse so you can give me a one game ban because I seem to be remorseful"""
32 years of age
"You gotta feel for the guy. After doing everything he could, playing through injury, his team losing in what is possibly the one chance at glory this season, and in the dying minutes of the game, conceding a foul right as you're about to create a chance to score?

What a rotten bit of luck for the ice-pack to slip out of his hand."
I love how he specified the minute to show us that he means it
"I’m a Chelsea fan. Loved him his last two seasons with us. His behaviour over the past few seasons has been disgraceful. He needs a ban, anger management classes"
Only for last night?
"He didn't disappoint anyone, he did what everyone can expect from him."
Cool. Now fuck off.
He needs help from professional. Probably have serious anger management issues
1 match suspension confirmed 👌
1 gala dinner ban.
fucking cunt
"So embarrassing. As a Madrid fan, I'm really beginning to think the Vinicius victim mentality and sipped right through the fabric of the club the last few years."
These apologies on social media are always so cringe
Fuck this Bully
"Go fuck yourselff

Fuck off <3 xoxo"
At least the phrasing seems like he wrote it himself
It's too easy my guy
There are few things as certain as the words spoken to Rudiger right before he told his social media team to scrawl this: “Toni you are facing a gigantic suspension if you don’t put out a meaningless apology”
"It’s ok guys, he just did an oopsie mistake after 111 minutes"
Horrible gimp of a man
Too little too late you lunatic.
"At least you call tell he wrote it himself judged on the orthographic mistakes but there is still no fucking excuse, what he did was fucking psychotic and he shouldn't play again this season."
"As much as he's a cunt I would like to give him credit for presumably going to bed, cooling off and coming to his senses 

But fuck off what is that apology, doubt he wrote it himself for one but also reading it you'd think he only swore at the ref or got into a scuffle with a Barca player

Should have sedated him last night"
Yeah go fuck yourself you unhinged man
1 year in jail should be enough after this apology
"At least he apologised and showed remorse, but the punishment must be severe."
Apology accepted.Now ban the motherfucker for 6 months !
"Surely you have to make an example? 7+ game ban, if not longer?"
"You're a fucking grown man. Being frustrated is acceptable, throwing shit like a toddler isn't.
You're supposed to be a professional."
Anything less than a 4 games suspension will be a shitshow
Pepe>>>>Rudiger. Pepe was likeable Rudiger is just a piece of shit.
"ChatGPT? HR Damage Control? Googled Sorry Note? 

100% he does this shit again!"
Apology is not accepted
"I don't really think he disappointed somebody, at this point you can't expect different from him"
"Ohh that's so nice coming from a literal psycho killer, should be nowhere near a pitch for the rest of the season"
[Source](https://www.instagram.com/stories/toniruediger/3619889962681462482?utm_source=ig_story_item_share&igsh=YXE4azQ5aXU2MjAx)
He needs to seek help. Playing with bandages on both legs even after getting injured. Not listening to your team mates and staff when they tell you to stop. He goes out of control when he's angry.
"Yeah, do one?"
"  Is in your team DNA to play without fairplay and be rough. After min 25 30,for almost every game,you all become so rough and loose control."
"Damage control before the punishment.

1 day ban incoming"
"Apology accepted. No ban for you

With Love,

RFEF, La Liga"
"Well at least that


Still, this is just a sample of how insane Perez made the club's approach to anything"
Shove your apology scumbag
I am glad that madrid proved that ref wrong. Those players are always so nice and rational...
Their whole team is acting out constantly. Subs running on the pitch hounding the referee should receive bans as well. It's embarrassing.
I honestly think they should sell him and bring in Marc Guehi.
Immediately deduct 10 points from Everton
This apology might save him from a long term ban.
"Nah fuck this shit. The RM, given its history and importance, should be extremely tough on these unacceptable behaviors; shame on him and the club if nothing happens."
What’s with players going to Real Madrid who seem like decent blokes and then turned into whoppers. I am looking at you Antonio and Jude!
"It's ok Antonio, I also sometimes behave like a rabid beast when I don't get what I want."
"""I did a mistake"" for a solid 3 minutes bro."
Bro just wanted to be an X-Man
"Excellent pr team. 

Reminds me of Bellingham and Georgia incident at euros.

Full respect for Georgia and referee of this match"
It's nice of him. I hope he's getting the juicy punishment he deserves.
Totally understandable. We all lose it sometimes…ahh nvm. F*** off!
“But he apologized “
"The whole Madrid team need to give themselves a really hard look in the mirror, coming across as a bunch of whining weiners. They are no longer role models, continuously looking for provocation and insulting everyone...once they finally stop overacting on the floor."
Florentino’s PR team already in work it seems
Cool. Ban him and sell him. I’m tired of this dude honestly.
Needs to come from his own mouth at a press conference or something. Easy to have someone write you a nice social media post
"Thank you Mahatma Gandhi for clearing it all up! So sincere, so inspirational. They really should award you the CdR trophy for your class and greatness"
"Yeah, I'm sure he really feels bad about it today... what a joke."
"Just buy the ref some glasses, seems to work a treat these days"
I suspect this come from his club to minimise his chance to get ban
"Ahhh so he apologized, 1 game suspension then"
3 match suspension appealed down to 1 and referee in the fridge for the whole season.
"Don't care, didn't ask. Ban this bitch"
"This apology should have been made publicly for his violent conduct towards their staff member a few months ago. The club let him and look where he is now.

Also, I very much doubt that this is a heartfelt apology."
Ban him for eternity and to the afterlife
"Acceptable, with reasonable ban,if it was a one game thing. Dude you are more of a hooligan than a football player. I see empty words."
Why do these statements always get written in -slightly- disjointed English? Why not their native language or the language of where they play?
PR agencies working overtime
this thug and Vini belong to prison. Pathetic scum
Fuck this guy. Fucking maniac
Fuck this guy
He’s a disgrace
"Not stopping you from a ban, bud. You did what I used to do in high school but a/ I was young, b/ I wasn’t playing for Real, c/ I would throw a punch than a bottle"
"Whatever dick head, grow up."
Mark my words: Rudiger will end up in den Turkish League!
"RFEF: Good enough, we’ll take it. Reduce to 1 match ban 

… and penalti a favor del Real Madrid."
"I think Real Madrid are doing this intentionally to discredit our success this season and their poor performance. 

It was said that they have got class, they are the gentlemen's club etc."
Alot of ppl in this thread are acting as if they have never lost their head ever before.
"Yeah drastic measures are necessary here, I recon it will be something crazy like a 2 match ban"
Everyone here pretending never to have gotten mad 🤣 yeaaah you guys all are better men than him. Good job be proud.
"Raise your hand who hasn't made any mistakes in their life, it's a human thing. The important thing is he acknowledges his mistakes and grows as a person. This is a life lesson guys, good job Antonio!"
Probably forced by the club. Apologizing can reduce sanctions. I've seen it before.
Like a pre therapy Pepe
"Judging from the grammar, it was written by a 9 year old."
"His agent is worse, if it's the same as the one when he was in Chelsea."
For the referee.
"Hes normally such a calm and classy player like his teammates, I think we should just let him off. He's definitely learned his lesson with this deeply personal statement"
"Worked for Mbappé, just need their pals in Marca to run with the ""he's really sorry"" headline for a few hours to really make sure he doesn't miss too much time"
And points deduction for Everton
1 match ban seems fair no? It was just a heat of moment clash between the teammates
you can see that he truly regrets it and that this was just a one-off incident from an otherwise monk-like peaceful player
"Meh, these types of comments are always so lame. So nobody can ever make a good apology according to you guys? If he'd thrown in a swear word you would have believed it?

And for the record: I think the guy is despicable. But this holy Reddit attitude is fucking unbearable."
What guy me during his psychotic break was his eyes while he was being held back. You could see he had completely lost it and God knows what he would have done if he had been able to reach the ref.
"“From his social media team”

They really feel bad for his behavior. The guy is criminal."
"Throwing a projectile at a referee should get you a multiple month ban in any serious competition.

So, of course he'll get a 1 game suspension."
"- signed, his PR team."
You're creating a scenario in your head that is almost certainly not going to happen and getting mad at it
32 years of rage
"Then all of his colleagues were holding him back as he tried to go and apologise to the referee in the moment, no wonder he was getting worked up"
You got me in the first half not gonna lie
"It's maybe a clever way to reference the incident without saying what actually happened. Like, without saying, ""when I threw stuff at the ref""."
Bro has some serious anger issues. Should honestly be adviced some councelling from club.
what do you want him to do?
"You underestimate PR teams.

“Let’s make slight grammatical mistakes since English isn’t this ^(reprobate’s) first language.”"
Hehe i love your innocence
"Yes he wrote it himself, LMAO"
">orthographic mistakes

could you point these out as English is not my first language?"
Oh must be hard for him to sleep after his apology denied by a Reddit basement dweller
Seem like decent bloke? Remember what he done to debruyne? Hes a scumbag. Always has been. He gets away with so much.
Yeah all we attacked the ref with a pack of ice once
That statement literally makes no sense
It comes off as insincere when you have a history of doing weird unhinged shit
And some people like you are acting like this kind of behaviour from Rudiger hasn’t been a pattern.
"Yep, r/soccer truly is unbearable. What Rudi did is unexcusable but in the heat of the moment, rush of adrenaline these things can happen. Just shows 80% of this sub probably never played football. They would probably send zizou to jail if he headbutted somebody today.

Again Rudiger's actions were disgusting, but he lost his head and now that he's cooled off he apologized, should still definetly get lenghty ban but  it seems like this sub would rather have him not apologizing at all which I just don't understand."
"El Clasico is in 2 games, so lets reduce that ban to a 1 match ban. Thats how Mbappe got to play today after trying to end someones career"
I have been very mad but I never wanted to take it out on another person?
He gave ice water to referee to cool off and the referee was rude to send him off referee suspended for 1 month rudiger wins fair play award for considering referee hydration /s
"Yea, every real madrid player could become a saint after they retire from football.
Him belingham and vinicius are definetly top contenders."
Def the new jackal of Madrid. Dark lord pepe is pleased. 
Clearly the red card should be revoked.
Tbf football would be a lot less fun without shithouses
"Throwing the projectile, and then refusing to leave the pitch and needing to be restrained. If it's a short ban that sets a terrible example, I do think this will be 5+ matches at least despite everyone's pessimism."
throwing the ice pack looks bad but it's actually just an an inside‑joke gesture towards some close friends who were at the game
I shit you not if this was cricket he would get banned for a year.
What about _two_ projectiles?
And a 10 second penalty to Ocon
It should be a suspension within the club as well with how many of staff had to hold him back at such a crucial stage
Antonio Ragiger
"Well at this point and after the media attention around the match, he can’t deny the footage"
"um, in the mentioned 111th minute he was only subbed off and Barcelona wasn't even leading yet"
Wouldn’t be an overreaction to ban such a person from contact sports
He tried to kill MLS out of frustration
"Stop acting like scummy twat would be a good start.

Apologies mean little and all about self preservation as he will be at it again."
To apologise and accept months length ban. That's what we call: to take accountability.
Play football and win games!
Not throw stuff at the ref during the game?
Show it on the pitch instead of trying to end careers or start fights every game? Apologies mean nothing if hes just gonna do it again next time.
"This was the first draft that he deleted 

> Verily, there existeth no excuse for mine conduct yesternight. I am most grievously sorry therefor. From the second half onward, we didst play a game most valiant; yet after an hundred and eleven minutes, I found myself unable to render aid unto mine fellows. Ere the final whistle did sound, I committed a grievous error. I do humbly beseech forgiveness of the referee and all whom I did disappoint yesternight."
">grammatical mistakes

could you point these out as English is not my first language?"
"""Did a mistake"" is definitely the biggest one

Then the rest of the message just doesn't come off as something a native speaker would word it like, just doesn't come off as smooth."
No I don’t remember that incident. I’ll have a google to refresh my memory. Just seen the video. I take it back. He wasn’t ever a decent bloke
"You cannot ignore his history here. This is far from the first time he goes crazy during a game, which combined with his constant foul play makes the apology sound completely hollow. ""No I swear, this time I mean it"" doesn't convince me."
You’re saying exactly what everyone else is saying but with more words.
"Just wait 10-15 years then reddit will be full with Real Fans comments how Rüdiger was misunderstood it was just isolated accidents, he is not a dirty player etc.

Like they try to gaslight everybody with Pepe and Ramos."
I know the these guys can be cunts on the pitch but Vinicius is using like half of his money educating poor kids in brazil 😭
+6 points and a penalty to RM
"He wasn't being a shit house yesterday tho. Chucking stuff at the referee, being verbally abusive, committing blatant fouls multiple times. 

That's just being a thug"
You think that last Clasico was fun? It was terrible.
"I’ve always been a defender of Rudiger & shithousery in general but trying to assault the referee isn’t the same as playing dirty, mocking people etc. it’s indefensible."
"This guy doesn't stop at shithousing. It would have been a problem if that's that but he's not even doing that. He's just a piece of shit bully with huge anger issue. It's one thing if his behaviour stays on the pitch but judging from the clips that circulated around last year of him bullying one of the kitmen, I very much doubt so"
He tries to grab ice packs to throw two more times. Ridiculous.
"It should be 5 months minimum, not 5 matches. Most of that ban will be in the break so realistically he would be missing 10 or so games but at least the punishment would sound harsh and be a deterrent."
"Also, how was he allowed to hang around and accept his losers medal? Shouldn't he have been off the pitch?"
"I think the ref looked like he had cramp, so Rudiger was just trying Express-Physio!"
"Brother, in cricket or rugby even questioning the refs decision (even if it's wrong) can get you suspended.

Football operates on a whole different planet to every other sport. Anything goes, call the referee a disabled cunt. Release videos about him before the game questioning his integrity. Wild shit."
"served penalty incorrect, drive through penalty. ""I'm close friends with a Real Madrid player"", penalty reduced to slap on wrist."
10 point deduction for Everton.
Joe Kelly suspended 5 games
"Maybe he was advised not to make any statement of what he did. Maybe they first want to see what they sue/ban him for, and then make a proper appeal? No clue though, it's just what came to my mind after reading your observation."
"Yeah, so he basically apologized for ""something"" that happened between the 111. minute and the final whistle. Could basically be anything."
But the thing is the staff stopped it from getting worse. We’ll never know what he would have done but it could have been worse.
He could have killed him.
"Well he did the first part, second part is up to whoever does the bans"
Remember the Lyon coach got 9 months ! For walking up to an official aggressively. This guy physically launched objects at the referee which could have harmed him.
He's just a super chill guy who cares about the ref's aching muscles. Deserves applause really.
"It’s pretty much only in LaLiga, they are Madrid bitches"
"In cricket, an agressive celebration can get you banned for one game"
I mean that probably only happened in la liga lol
"Yeah, Rudiger would have gotten a 3 month ban at least if it was rugby.

I don't follow football as much, but I was kinda shocked by the childish reactions of RM at the end of the game. Very shameful for the sport."
Dhoni literally walked on to the field during a match to protest an umpire’s decision and he got off with only a fine
" Your totally right , it can be used to deflate the decision or some sort of, but i think its up to the referee himself"
Or any of MLS's future descendants judging by where his foot landed on that kid
That's a fact i don't know why people are too emotional nowadays
"Yes, but there's a big difference with the Lyon coach and why he got such a severe penalty, and that is he's not the Real Madrid coach."
True he doesn’t have a cartel boss like Perez that can scare the organisation. Such bullshit which makes the mockery of the sport and deters any young Spanish men from being a referee. Sign up to get attacked by Real Madrid players and your family threatened if you don’t bend down
"**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**

Are you sure about that.
Must have played another game than the one I'm seeing.
When you’re used to privilege equality feels like oppression
Lmao this guy
Such a crybaby
Is he for real 🤣real escaped few cards already
Why did he turn into such a cry baby
"Bellingham is a fantastic footballer, but an absolutely insufferably privileged individual. All he ever does is complain and whine about the things not going his way."
"This guy is a joke, all of them are at this point

I wonder if Arnold will become a clown like them next season"
Yeah like the pen on cubarsi
Psychotic behavior 
Always moaning about refs lmao
You can't be serious lol
One of the more unlikeable players itw right now
"They’re so shameless. From their low IQ fans, entitled players, to their demonic President"
"do we know that hes talking about refs? start of the video aint clear enough to me

i mean ...i am as far as one can be from defending him, but at the same time, he can be talking about game situations like pass through close spaces somehow go through for barca but his pass dont and so on ... u know ... legendary football luck is more on the side of barca instead of real."
Madrid could have had another 2 or 3 yellows and a penalty against them but sure
They really do believe this stuff eh?
And Madrid fans think he's better than Pedri lmao
Why is he acting so entitled? Zidane + Galactico’s just played better
Yes like that clear penalty on cubarsi
The behaviour from the club has been embarrassing lol surely they feel some shame atp
Biggest bunch of whiny cunts I've ever seen. Absolutely pathetic childish behavior from all of them .
Don't get all the comments here saying he's talking about the refs. Maybe he's talking about 50/50 duels going Barca's way?
already crying lmao
One thing is for sure....jude adapted to Spanish football fully...biggest diva every match
"Bellingham watches RMTV, not this match."
Maybe having at least one shot in first half would help your situation?
"That's kids, what you call a whiny bitch."
"I feel like the honeyswoon period for him is coming to an end. The whining, the dirty challenges, he is not doing wonders for his image recently"
"Mourinho 'world against us' mentality works sometimes, but also makes players believe literally every decision is against them."
"Lolololol buddy, even the 90/10 in Barca’s favour is going to Madrid. The audacity."
Pathetic lmao.
These guys are just shameless. everyone who watches the match knows whom the ref tries to favor. Cubarsis pen vas not even look at which was 100% pen.
"Minimum two more yellows for Rudiger and Asencio. Potential penalty on Cubarsi. Martin getting a yellow when Ferran was clearly fouled from behind so it should have been a free kick.

Truly a crybaby"
The delusion is unreal
Cry is free
0 shots tho
"Aye no bother Jude.

Lad has a career as an RMTV host after he retires though. I bet he’d be able to get the kids of every ref in Spain bullied if he got the job."
Crybaby club full of crybaby players
I’m fucking tired of this guy.
Such a wanker's club
Cry some more 😂 clown team
"Jude Bellingham needs to be kicked more. 

He's the most unlikable cunt in football, which is saying something considering who Arsenal employ"
Honestly this whole saga has been embarrassing to witness as a fan.
"After causing such a scandal, do they still lose?

They're pretty pathetic."
How do you not hate this team lmfao
"With that kind of mentality, no wonder why they lost."
"I’ve never seen someone become so unlikeable in a single year span. His PR machine was working overtime last year as he seemed like an absolute saint, but in reality, he is really quite a cunt."
Bellingham is such a cry bully I'm over this guy
Rewatch the game Jude.
"It’s a pity Jude is turning out to be an entitled, arrogant little prick."
"""When you are accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression."""
"Madrid is auch an unlikable club, holy shit. Were their players always like this or do they get taught to act like this as soon as they arrive in Madrid?"
Bellingham without tap ins is such a useless guy
I fucking hate this club holy shit
"This guy is actually a prick, typical bluenose really."
Bellinghams mentality is awful lol
Worst club in the world. Madrid’s a bunch of rat bastards run by the king of rats
Team full of victims
This is generational cope
Rub it up ya Jude. Whingebag
This dude can’t be real hahahahahahaha
"Fuck me, it'll hurt if we lose Trent but it'll hurt so much more to see him go here and adopt such an arrogant mentality."
Generational whiner. I prefer Madrid but there gone mentally
I didn't hear that. Nirbuave I seen the game. Is thisnpropaganda?
"Actual loser attitude. They knew that Barca was going to humiliate them a 3rd time this season, so they came with the excuse ready this time."
"Is this the game they weren’t going to turn up for? 

I thought they were 50/50 to even start. 

(Maniacal laugh hahahaha)"
"my exact point, why would real madrid even bother playing when they are just gonna throw the ref under the bus whatever the result is???

arent madrid too big of a club to be playing these childish games or is carlo so disillusioned by this season that he has already checked out and has let all reins go?"
"bro, you play for real madrid. against granada, everything fucking 70:30 for them goes your way. suck it up."
"A different club and a different manager could have weeded this tendency out of Jude, but Real Madrid under Ancelotti seems to be the perfect environment for raising petulant little twats."
Honestly In one Word Fck jude Bellingham.
Wah 😫 poor baby 😭
"TBH… if you bitch and moan publicly about officials cheating you when they didn’t… when your club historically gets all the calls… don’t be surprised if your team suddenly doesn’t get any 50/50 calls lol

Can’t spit at and bite the hands that feeds you"
"Madrid are actually so cooked. They're the biggest European club, with the most Champions League titles by a mile and yet are convinced they are constantly being shafted"
"When you’re used to privilege equality feels like oppression.

So true"
What a mofo srsly
"I loved him at Dortmund. But since joining Madrid, he’s changed into this child that gets upset when he’s not winning. Much less professional than I was expecting him to be as he got older"
That entire club has such a shit mentality
I feel like he’s only here for the zipline and there’s something on the pitch that makes him worried about his life.
The man is fucking delusional
"I'm tempted to give him the benefit of the doubt here and say that he's complaining about the team losing the duels.

*However,* that benefit vanished the moment he got a red card for talking smack to the referee. He should be thanking de Burgos for keeping the match competitive."
cope harder
Wonder if Trent is going to turn into this type of giant asshole as soon as he joins 
Real Madrid players sound like Arsenal fans
This is what happens when a club and it's players are more concerned about pushing a ref agenda than focusing on the match. Pathetic club
Saying this after cubrasi pull down is diabolical
"prolly just the intensity of the game speaking through him, but it's a delusion. the ref was clearly affected by all the talk and he gave quite a few times the benefit of the doubt to Madrid in the first half at least."
These guys are such crybabies.
What a fucking clown 🤣
"When you're accustomed to privilege, less privilege feels like oppression"
slightly delulu
"Madrid is an amazing club in general.

But the way they are behaving currently as a club and players on their own is absolutely pathetic."
"I really hope Trent flops at this privileged, disgusting club."
God he's a bit of an obnoxious twat
"Lol crybaby, wish he loses an other euro final"
"Wow, being beaten so comprehensively by Arsenal has really rattled them"
Real madrid really are turning into one of the most unlikable clubs
Shut. The. Fuck. UP.
Watching the game it feels the other way around… these guys are delusional. Starting to think Vini and Bellingham run the RMTV account
"Yea , they tried to break Olmo's foot damn near 3 times and got away with a clear pen . Yet this fucker cries. Maybe track back when you misplace a pass instead of trying to get clicks putting the hand over your head and causing a goal.  Fucker"
"The audacity of this club. They were spared at least three confirmed yellow cards. They are still whining like babies, like they are the victims."
the balls on these dudes are fucking crazy
What a crybaby.
Trent wants to join this melt?
"When even the supposed leaders at Real Madrid think the referee is against them after that first half, you know the mentality at the club is in the dumps."
"Cry, overrated Englishman."
"I have never seen bigger sets of cunts at this point.

No sense of rationality among the RM players.

Everything going their way brother Rudiger,tchou and ceballos should be in fucking Jail by now."
a key element of fascism is making it appear that the entire world is organized against your group when in fact you are in the most advantageous and powerful position in society. real madrid are a textbook example of this phenomenon.
this guy was so good at dortmund how tf did he become such a cunt ?
Real Madrid this season is probably the most pathetic and laughable club.
Literally every foul and pen call went their way is he concussed?
Are you sure about that
The irony here
shameless prick
Fuck off you twat.
I mean that's what you will feel like if they teach you you're always at the short end of the stick. Bunch of crybabies.
Lol my guy .. your team committed a penalty that was not called
Its going your way brother wtf
This clown is fkng blind
What a joke lol
"Just don’t understand what Trent sees in them. What about us, lad?"
God he’s such a fucking knob seriously
"Stop whining, get on with the game"
He must’ve not seen that shirt pull which was a penalty for Barca and not given
...what? Lol
Classy Madrid as always 🤷‍♂️
Have to admit I’ve not been watching the game and am maybe being charitable to them but is it possible he means second balls 50/50 challenges etc not ref decisions?
He said respectfully.
Someone threw their rattle out the pram
:: Meme of woman crying pointing at cat ::
So whiny and petulant.
Spanish lessons going well then
Classic Madrid behaviour.
The fucking audacity lmao I must be watching another match
JAASHDAHDHASJ WAT
Victim mentality must be on the job advert for Madrid.
These guys are so focused on the officials it gets in the way of their football. Get over it and play.
"Bruh so many flopping, i hate this kind of soccer infecting mostly laliga and S.America futbol. Fk this shit."
He could be talking about the refs or he could be talking about his team’s effort. You guys are just running with the narrative at this point.
He's a hell of a player but fuck me Jude is the epitome of whinging pom
Like the valverde hand ball
WAH WAH WAH
"They are so pathetic.

Madrid really need to sort themselves out. How can Madrid fans support this whiny, embarrassing, entitled, deluded attitude from their players and president?"
Hey Jude don't take it bad....
What arsenal does to a club
Bitch as joins a team of bitch asses
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/003/052/341/5e2.gif
"See, normally if you go one-on-one with another team you got a 50/50 chance of going their way."
"50/50 go to Barca, but obvious one go to Real?"
Play better…
This guy needs to get his eyes checked
I remember Macallister said same words
I understand his frustration. When you get every 50/50 or even less probable decisions in favor for decades as a club. You starts to believe that’s your right and you get frustrated for every decision which doesn’t goes your way 🤪
delulu. we have eyes but they can tell themself those BS excuses
He should probably look into Real’s history there
"God damn he is so mentally fragile. I had a bit of respect for him before our tie but ever since I started to see how he reacts to being down, I've lost all respect for him. The guy has no mental game and just isn't used to losing."
You don't get to say shit like that wearing a Real Madrid shirt
This Madrid team is so unlikable
Fucking crybabies!
Then you have Vini and Szczesny being best buds in the front. Proof that Brits don't know how to have fun.
"lol, lmao even"
There's no way he should be saying that. Madrid would be down by at least 1 man and a few more yellows at HT with the correct ref calls.
"Fellas, for comparison purposes, did Bale complain like this in his time at RM?"
tiny dick mentality
"Entitled pricks, escaped couple of penalties, escaped red card for Tchou and yet they keep complaining. Sick club, disgusting players"
Have people never played football? He's talking to his teammates about 50/50 challenges. Saying they need to win more 50/50s
"call me crazy but i believe he means loose balls and such, like how they were just sat on top of us suffocating us. i could very well be wrong tho"
The audacity
Lmoa funniest shit i have seen today
"Well no wonder his season’s been poor, he’s been playing blind"
Shameless entitled twat. We should’ve had AT LEAST one stone wall penalty and two more yellows.
Madrid 1 shot 0 on target Barcelona 9 shots 4 on target btw
He was such a professional player before joining Real Madrid
Lost the plot
"To think I actually liked him after his first season at Madrid. Turns out he's a huge sore loser, who would have thought?"
If anything the ref has made a bunch of calls in your favor. I better see Ceballos getting carded in the second half
"I guess that penalty episode wasn't really 50/50, so it doesn't count"
WHAT A FKN CLOWN. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT PEDRI GOAL
"Such victims when you literally have been dodging calls against you.

Yelling that while refs walking behind him is pure attempt to manipulate them even further."
"Oh Jude you intolerable little brat, glad he didnt come to Liverpool"
"Most footballers think this, only have to go down to your local 5 a side to see them saying the same thing lol"
But this perfectly sums up his signature crybaby faci expression with that obnoxious eyebrows.
"He's probably talking about Real losing 50/50 duels, no?"
Now that is a new level of cope. Ask your buddies rudiger and ceballos about that 🤡
Madrid are so pathetic. The way they have reacted around the ref this game has been an embarrassment.
It's amazing how all Real Madrid players end up with this attitude.
I see Jude chose the perfect club for his mentality. 🤣😭
"They literally got 2 penalties cancelled 

Wtf do you want"
"Real Madrid players complaining about referees!?

Are these rich assholes braindead? Oh, sorry. Forgot for a moment they are football players. That’s a yes."
This guy cries and whinges about everything. He is quickly becoming extremely irritating and annoying. He will become very unliked if he continues like this.
Uhh that Real Madrid buddy
He is such a whinly unlikeable little bitch.
Someone call the whambulance!
"I wanted him at Liverpool. Not sure his attitude at Dortmund, but man he has become such a diva since joining Madrid"
Crybaby fanbase. Crybaby players. Crybaby club.
Real is the spoiled child of laliga. They want everything irrespective of the situation.
This season has been one big PR blunder from Real
Thank goodness they lost. Entitled pricks
"They were afraid and passive sitting back like a relegation team in the first 30-35 minutes. 50/50, my ass.

With their squad, they can play much more attractive and be a protagonist."
Meanwhile madrid should've had 1 or 2 red cards and given away at least 2 pens that didn't get called. Ridiculous mentality they have.
"Bruh, Barca was literally denied 2-3 penalties."
"They managed to gaslit themselves into thinking this.

Trent you see this, lad?"
This Bellingham guy is turning out to be more of a rat than I thought
Insane that people in this sub don’t know that 50/50 refers to winning balls/passes
Freaking babies. 🖕 Barca but man Madrid organization bitches about everything.
Is every Spanish team just filled with a bunch of whiny cunts? Embarrassing display of professionalism from both sides 
 Typical Real Madrid whiny bullshit....
As a neutral he is propa c u nt
Disliking this clown more by the day
"Watch how people who never played Football will be crying about it in the comments.

You say all kinds of stuff when you're in the moment. I've played a ton of amateur games and everytime I did I always felt the ref was against my team."
Wow im shocking news player of a losing team is mad who would have thought. This is literally about duels we keep losing not about refs.
Lol the bias in the comments is crazy
"Cubarsi had his shirt 50/50 on, maybe he meant that?"
Are you sure
Are you sure about that?
Pretty sure Rudiger's ice pack was fully going in one way.
Are you sure about that that's why?
"The irony of Real Madrid of all teams claiming a ref conspiracy against them is the wildest shit.

They have two decades of favorable calls in the bag."
"Feels like they just made it a point to try and influence the ref as much as they possibly can for this. 

Like they had a meeting last week with PowerPoints and shit for their refereeing discourse strategy lmao."
It’s the looser mentality leaking
"Indeed, nothing major but Real could certainly have had some yellows in that half."
"It's not equality, they've had nearly every call in the favor. If he means we're winning every 50/50 ball, then sure because him and Vini weren't tracking back a couple times."
Its not even equality the ref is blatantly favoring them lmao
Where the fuck is the equality? If there was equality they’d be down to at least 10.
"r/soccer favorite quote, i lost count of how many times i have seen this shit"
"It does feel like that when top sides moan, anything they get was right and anything they don't is the end of the world."
Wow I’m gonna take that.
Bro is casually dropping MLK level quote on Reddit.
Tenner bet you'll find players from both teams saying that just about every single game tbf.
all lives matter
Yall such drama fucking queens lmaoo
"bellingham tears, sweetest tears"
is this what the kids are calling gas lighting these days?
Banfed you twice last season
"Such a shame.  Was a big fan of him, but this last year, he has been insufferable."
"Tchouameni tackle was a red imho way too dangerous. 

Plus smaller teams would have probably conceded a penalty on that hand… 

But everything 50/50 going to barca lmao"
Always has been
Has always been like that. Used to hate his guts at Dortmund
"He's always been that way, it just shows more because Madrid encourages it"
"He always was. Their real personality shows when they are under pressure, but when it’s normal situation, he’s PR Jude put jacket on cold mascot kid. 

*Ask theBundesliga fans, they know him better. This guy is putting on airs and all PR."
"Schulz is a terrible player and person but.. Always has been.

https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/MW2CWTeBvg"
Club culture
"Always been like that, real is only classy when they get favoured and they are winning."
"He’s always been like this. 

Acted like a little bitch when we knocked Dortmund out of the champions league"
Its in their DNA
"Surely it’s quite well known by now that as incredibly talented as he is, Bellingham is very petulant indeed. Nothing I want to see more than Barca winning this game."
Because their losing fair and square 
Anyone who pointed this out during his time at Dortmund was downvoted to oblivion
He signed for Real Madrid
"Gets away with too much shit , he probably forgot some of the rules"
Just comes with the type of player that looks to join Madrid over any other club.
That’s the Real Madrid effect
Even before real i saw this. Was super petulant when potter chelsea knocked out his dortmund from the champions league.no surprise its more visible at real
"He's the main character, and all the good and bad that comes with that"
The Madrid effect
Because he joined Madrid obviously
You just described the entire real madrid squad / club.
perfect fit for the club
You don’t join the circus unless you’re going to perform
"Guaranteed, he’s petulant and moody in about 1 out of 10 games already no matter what’s going on at Liverpool, Madrid will bring that side out of him even more."
Imo choosing to join this clown show makes him a clown already
Bruh trent probably isnt as bad as jude but hes petulant af lol
Will become? Think he’s already doing a great job
mods work overtime to delete replays lol
That wasn't 50/50 to be fair. It was clear
cuba was literally horizontal and somehow the ref was like yeah play on boys ... whats even more surprising is that the VAR didnt work only when rapha dived ? where was the VAR during cuba and ferran pens ?
Legit Trump level delusional wtf is this
You can if you have no shame
The guts to say this lmao after the first half we have had. They have been worse than Getafe
Most of their online fans have been speaking out against Perez & RMTV. So which fans are you referring to exactly? I assume you live in Madrid?
It could easily mean every 50/50 duel goes to them because they show more effort and he’s mad at his own team for not giving their all
"Wow, a well thought out comment by someone who watched the video, my eyes must be deceiving me."
When it starts it sounds like he’s saying “make them understand” - quite possibly to Carlo based on where he is looking. Could well be you’re right and wants the manager to give them all a bollocking for not putting in the effort
I got ridiculed last season for saying that Pedri will be better than Bellingham once he fixes his injury issues.
Pedri not getting enough praise for that strike. Such a beauty
"The current culture and victim mentality that was bread by current cunts like Vini, Rudiger, Carvajal, Bellingham and past cunts like Ramos and Benzema"
"He's saying it directly to the refs, you can see them coming up the stairs behind him. Also, ""goes their way"" is typically used to refer to refereeing decisions, whereas if you're talking about duels, you'd expect him to say ""they're winning every 50/50""."
"He is literally talking about us losing 50/50
duels you ameba"
Tchouameni with a blatant scissor tackle on Olmo from behind and no review
He's been unlikeable since his Dortmund days. People are only seeing it now
Crazy right?
The Madrid Side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
"He joined madrid, just look at their track record."
None of his teammates are in the direction he's speaking besides Mbappe who had spent the entire half on the bench.
He wasn’t liked at Dortmund either. He’s a douche bag
"""Everybody is wrong but me"""
Kind of like 65/35 I'd say. That was a strong pull.
"Okay that is funny, but I honestly kind of think he means it as Barca are winning all the 50/50 balls and situations. Like he's frustrated at his own team for being a step behind in pace or effort. Maybe I'm being generous lol"
"Pretty sure, threw a trash bag into space at work"
Must just be so used to every call going their way that playing fair football just seems like it's a crooked ref.
Only two decades?
"8 decades, also imagine how it was during the dictatorship if it is this way now with so much evidence"
Only two decades?
"Only two decades? Far longer then that, they were after all the favourite club of a certain dictator"
LMAO... Only 1 club out of the 2 that played in this match have been to court for corruption in recent years... very recent even.
Yep the only team to have 2 consecutive years with no pens called against them is Real Madrid oh wait not it isn't.
And apparently it paid off
How bout that loser mentality now buddy
"Remember that post a few days ago about players who run the least per match in La Liga (or was it in CL? IDK, can't find the post) and 3 of the top 5 players were Real Madrid. I

They've got their luxury front line of people who refuse to put in work, unless it's chasing a stat like assist or goal."
"He's obviously referring to Barca overrunning them by winning most challenges.

People just got their panties in a bunch with the whole refereeing drama so they see it in every single thing."
I thought the ref did okay for most the calls but the Cubarsi one was definitely a pen.
Yeah I understood it as 50/50 ball 😅 but what do I know
"Don’t talk to me about equality. Madridistas are the most oppressed group on earth. 

Don’t share your opinion when you haven’t dealt with a fraction of the pain and suffering they do on a daily basis. /s"
"12-4, two finals

Keep crying"
Nevermind the corner where it hit the post . Barca players shirt was half way up his torso lol modrics tackle .. I mean
Nah Madrid makes you like that
"And also because Madrid encouraging it turns it into a national and sometimes international incident.

Any other club, if players bitch and moan about the ref or whatever or even if the coach joins in in the post game press conference, it ends there more or less. Fans continue to bitch and moan but by and large no one outside the bubble hears about it.

But with Madrid, you then have an official press release, which leads into literal propaganda videos on official club media, which leads to many if not most major sports outlets in the country echoing the club's narrative thanks to Florentino's many pawns in the media, ...

For people who take a step back it just makes Bellingham look ridiculous, but that doesn't stop the toxic environment Real desires from impacting things."
even his teammates in Dortmund didn't like him because he was a diva back then.
"When Chelsea played against him at BVB he was being made an absolute fool of all game and resorted to kicking anyone he could get close to. 

He's a thug"
Flagrant 2 is leaking
Nah he was a notorious complainer and whiner with us too. He literally got scolded 2-3 times by teammates during games to snap out of it and get going.
Nah he's always been like this. Won't forget the crash out he had when we knocked Dortmund out of the CL and he pushed over a cameraman after trying to break James' leg.
This made me chuckle lol.
Yeah lad’s a crybaby too when he’s playing poorly
Yet. Just wait
"This one is up for almost half an hour by now, perhaps they gave up.

https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1k8n5jq/penalty_shout_for_barcelona_on_cubarsi/"
They always have with Barcelona as soon as they go deep in the UCL. Reminds me of 2019 when they kept deleting even goals scored
Bellingham is a MAGA confirmed
"Fits the club.

All you need to do is take a look at the spanish comments on all the videos (for instance) on the refs video."
Crazy how that name can creep into a sub for soccer.
Why would a Barcelona fan be living in Madrid? They probably live in the US
No no no... rabble... rabble rabble
I like your compliments but dont get your hopes up i am Spreadsheet fc fan ... this is just exception ... all i do is i moan about our new ownership.
Cheating twats
"would you mind watching your language, cunt."
That should have been a red. Fermin and Ferran got a red for much less this season
No one said anything about right or wrong.
"I believed that at first, but then I saw Vasquez holding him, while Jude is looking back at the refs, not his teammates."
WHERE IS OMNI-MAN?!
"If 90% of calls go your way, surely the other 10% are the problem"
"“When you’re so used to privilege, equality feels like oppression”"
"No, but I just took recent memory.

Let's not forget this is a club that was the darling of the Franco dictatorial regime for 40 years and was basically the first 'sportswashing' effort."
That's unfortunate buddy
Loser says what?
Win or loose it’s still a looser mentality. A players true personality is shown during a loss not a win.
Say what now?
Spoke to soon eh?
Mbappe definitely drags this team down at times with his lazy ass shit.
Real madrid has received only one yellow card and that was for scissor tackel from behind
Vini was offside
14-4 this season
He was also like this at Dortmund
The entitlement for sure
"Dortmund makes you like that too, Dortmund is just a different type of assholery"
"Not really this is an American website and he’s the most talked about President ever,particularly for being a petulant whiny baby of a man"
For work? They met their partner there maybe? Many fans live in different cities to the one they support.
Is this sarcasm
"SEA SALT, I NEED YOU SEA SALT"
"""Are we dirty players?""

""No, it's the referees who are wrong!"""
"> was basically the first 'sportswashing' effort.

One of the first, but certainly not the first.

The nazis were quite big on what we now call sportswashing, with the whole Berlin Olympics thing and pumping a lot of money into building the best racecars the world has seen up to that point."
Will be amusing if PSG win the CL as soon as he left
I know we love to shit on Mbappe in this sub but wasn’t he injured prior to this game?
He's talking about ascencio foul on cubarsi
"Can confirm, but he's gotten worse after leaving"
"You got a point. But the r/soccer hivemind at times it’s crazy. Obviously someone with an England flair knows Spain well, unthinkable for them that someone born and raised in Barcelona that moved to Madrid supports their local childhood team."
"there's a million ways to say you're losing every 50/50, 'everything 50/50' is clearly referring to referee decisions"
"Donald, clip that."
are you shore?
"One of the reasons I don't mind PSG winning this year.

Another being anyone but Arsenal"
"Funny enough, I’ve been defending him for most of the year. 

Part of his and Madrid’s problem is the one they knew coming into the season. They now have two great players trying to play the same position at the same time. They don’t have a striker anymore and it’s much easier for teams to defend against them. 

Another problem is that both of them are lazy as hell. So instead of one lazy player last year, they now have two."
"Oh I wasn't watching until like 30min in. Yeah that was definitely a pen. The Ferran one might be as well, though that was much lighter."
What do you mean willingly right ? In regards to what?
For once I can agree with Chelsea fan
"**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**

Rarely does Courtois screw up his his bad…
Did the fubo/espn stream go down? They just cut to commercial
"Real’s defense all over the place, how is there an open runner on the far post uncovered? And what is Courtois doing? This Madrid squad is something else, defensively speaking they make lots of dumb mistakes."
oh my fucking god he’s insane
trallallero trallala
Crazy opinion: he’s kinda good for his age
"Christ he’s such a complete player. Like we see young phenoms quite a lot but they’re never this well rounded. He can dribble, he can pass, he can score. What can’t Yamal do?"
I love u both
Great Assist but Rudriger fucking stinks.
Awful mistake from Courtois but Barcelona are by far the better team
Disgusting. I think this kid might be really good lads?
"Courtois, what are you doing 😭"
Imagine playing like this at 10 years old
Lamine is like the only player in the world living up to his hype.
Yamal is insane
Courtois assist was better
Ruddiger forgot he could slide. But then he slid to show that he remembered sliding was a thing?
This is supposed to be the best goalkepper in the world?
Fucking string
"lol why are there 2 defenders, had Carlo parked the bus after the second goal he could have sealed the deal"
Midfield Madrid! Seems like everyone stops and doesn’t bother running back
This was entirely on Courtois
"Dude feeran is the best striker rn great replacement for Lewandowski.

His pace is perfect to catch the long balls.

Absolute cinema match 🔥🔥"
"Barca need to watch how many minutes he’s playing, just like saka who is starting to get regular injuries"
Couldn't have placed it any better.
"I hear he's only 17 years old, can anyone confirm?"
Why is everyone wanking themselves off about a pretty standard pass that only looks good because Courtois made a mess of it?
"Yamal is a true gem, but this pass isn’t really worthy of its own post."
The amount of glazing this mf sub does on Yamal is so annoying
Doing his best Martinez impression
Tbh I think it makes it harder on Ferran than it would have been for Ferran to just pass to Raphinha for an open net.
"As in, he should have stayed behind and let Rudiger handle it? I don't think his decision was that bad."
it would be unamerican not to
Just came back
On TUDN there was a full screen commercial. I walked in from work and asked my brother who was winning and he said idk. Then 2 minutes later the game comes up and I’m wondering wtf just happened 😂
When you don’t have a stable defense all season this stuff happens.
Real Madrid's tactic after Guoer and co came on was practically overwhelm in midfield and go 2v2 with strikers on center backs. They abandoned their defensive shape and it almost worked for them lmfao
"possible excuse for Courtois is that he felt he had to rush out because he knew Rudiger was injured.

he also perhaps wouldn’t have a 1v1 against Ferran because Raphina was there. So maybe it’d be a simple tap in. 

or maybe i’m just trying to defend Courtois too much"
please don't run him into the ground
Kicks and assists like what I wanted to do as a kid. It's so smooth and not a bother to him. Incredible work by the academy again and he isn't the only one.
"please watch your language

he is indeed quite alright"
Bombardiro Crocodillo
"Daring today, aren’t we?"
Stock Reddit comment
In contention with best 17 yr old of all time. Only know very few players like R9 or Rooney who were freaks like this. I think only Pele has a claim for being better than him at 17. The potential is ridiculous.
"I mean, Barca has had at least ONE other very young player that set the world on fire. Hopefully Yamal has as long and successful of a career."
His finishing is absolutely horrible though
He just knows how to get away with punches. Average defender IMHO.
He has been playing with a busted knee for weeks and it showed today. He was a step too slow many times.
tbh Rudiger was barely walking at that point.
"He is the real goat from Barcelona. No ofense to Raphina but I still don’t understand why everybody put him above Yamal in the “Balón de oro” conversation.

Maybe just for the silly “the real best brazilian” jokes"
Pedri too. Idk what they do at La Massia but Barca really do have the best academy prospects. It’s going to be a joy to watch them over the next 5-10 years
Kami has very high football iQ
And you think it’s Dibu? 😂😂
Almost a decade LOL
What messi did you watch lol it didnt take him no decade
Yeah no it didn't take him a decade lol.
"dude Messi was 19 when he scored a hattrick against Madrid with 10-men Barcelona. And he was pulling these passes at least from 2008 when he was 21. Not a decade lol 

These Messi comparisons will never end well for Yamal or anybody in the long run. No one is catching Messi in goals, passes, dribbles - all 3 departments."
Recency bias
say it without crying
we’re never beating child labor fc allegations unfortunately
"> please watch your language 

Dude what"
"Ye sorry that was extremely controversial, I apologise to the entire football community for my discretions"
"True, I’m extremely uncreative, please make Rüdiger eat my first born son and break both of my knees"
"Yeah when its a clear goal opportunity, outside the box its pretty decent 😆"
"Thing is, the moment his finish gets on point he will be the best player in the world with a wide margin…"
He wants to become new Ramos
"Our best player is pedri, he was absolutely gassed today and didn’t get up to his normal level but he still is without a doubt for me the best"
"Raphinha has been insane in the UCL, which is part of why I think. Also subconsciously people discount Yamal because of his age, thinking that he has plenty of time to win it in the future."
"None of them are goats from Barcelona my dude. 

GOAT is an acronym for greatest of all time. You could call them MVPs = most valuable players tho."
"It really isn’t. Yamal is definitely the best 16 year old ever and arguably best 17 year old ever, he’s unreal for his age, only probably pele or Ronaldo 9 compare at 17. Cr7 and Messi hardly even played until 18"
ok.. glazing is annoying ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
"Never apologyze for being a free thinker, king 🧠"
"Ramos was really good at least.

Rudiger is not even remotly close the level of Ramos"
"True

But I feel Yamile will be"
In all honesty it's hard to compare this barcelona to the one back when messi was 17
Can't argue on that.

That’s actually a mad coincidence lol
They didn’t age
And he already looked 40 years old
Both didn't age it's another crazy part
Anyone making debut this week in bundesliga?
"I can’t believe this. Almost like it’s a simulation. 

Kompany moving to England seems so much later, TO ME, than Mueller’s debut."
If you asked me who's older would have never guessed Kompany. He's aged well.
Two of the best in the modern era 🫡
"Okay, now *this* is an insane factoid."
"People who were born when Müller debuted can almost vote which is not so much an interesting fact but the realization that I'm old as fuck. 

Him debuting under Klinsmann, these were the times. Jesus."
Reminds me of the VVD and Slot post.
I will miss him.
How time flies.
"Apropos of nothing, that was my fav Bayern kit"
Tom Mûller has been around since forever
"f* Kompany disrespect Muller, a legend, all this time, f* Kompany"

Muller didn't age because he already looked 35 when he made his debut
He looked a young 40. Now he looks like an slightly older 40.

The Robben way.

Jeezus. Who keeps track of these things
"3 -Hansi Flick has won each of his first three games against Real Madrid as FC Barcelona coach, including all competitions, making him only the second Barcelona coach in history to win his first three such games, after Pep Guardiola (five). Top.

Luka Modric (39y, 229d) is the 2nd oldest player in a Copa del Rey final behind Joaquín  (40y, 276d). The age difference between Yamal and Modric is the highest ever between 2 opponent players in a CdR final.

In the 6th Extra Time of a Clásico this was the 1st which Barcelona won. Real Madrid won 3 of them.

With 6 goals Ferran Torres is the top scorer of Copa del Rey 2024/25.

Kylian Mbappé scored the 1st free kick goal in a CdR final since Theo Hernández 2017 and the 1st for Real Madrid in such a game since Roberto Carlos and David Beckham 2004.

The 260th Clásico was the 1st played in Andalusia.

3 - Lamine Yamal directly contributed to goals in his last three Clásico appearances (two goals and one assist); becoming the fourth Barça player to do it since 2013/14 after Luis Suárez (twice), Sergi Roberto and Raphinha. Crack."
We're going into WW1 with this one lads
"Insane stat, happy it's broken"
"From the [Wikipedia article on that 1916 clash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_v_FC_Barcelona_\(1916_Copa_del_Rey\)):

> In the semifinals of the 1916 Copa del Rey, Real Madrid defeated Barcelona after facing each other four times in just under three weeks and of several highly controversial decisions by the referee José Berraondo, a former Madrid player.
>
> In the first leg at Barcelona, the Catalans defeated Madrid 2–1, and in the second leg at Campo de O'Donnell, the whites finally achieved their first official victory against Barcelona: 4–1. At the time, there was no goal difference, so they had to go to a tiebreaker, which sparked the very first conflict between both clubs, namely about the choice of the venue, O'Donnell again, and the referee, José Berraondo.[1] In the replay, Berraondo awarded three penalties in favor of his former team, two of which were saved by Barça's goalkeeper Luis Bru (one of which with his head), but the third was converted by Santiago Bernabéu in the 118th minute to salvage a 6–6 draw, thus forcing another replay, which was also refereed by Berraondo, who again made several questionable decisions, such as giving yet another last-minute penalty, which drove the Barça players to withdraw in protest.[1] Madrid thus advanced to the final against Athletic Bilbao that was played in Barcelona, where some banners in the stands even asked for Berraondo's head; Madrid lost 0–4.[2][3]


That last match was abandoned in the 113th minute, with Madrid FC leading 4–2, after FC Barcelona walked off the field in protest against the refereeing."
"Someone in the daily thread today called Kounde a french Nathan Patterson when i said I'd take him over trent

Who the fuck is Nathan Patterson?"
"The real question is, how many times did a Barca vs Real game go to extra time since 1916."
Gracias Brahim!
Damn bro I forgot about that
SWEET SWEET SWEET STRIKE! What a way to do it 109 years later! HISTORIC!!!
"Mister chip, literally his entire schtick"
Ain't no one alive currently who's seen that goal
It’s pretty easy to find. There’s probably only a handful of Clasicos that have ever gone to extra time
"It's surely mostly just some clever database usage. A quick search of ""Barcelona goals vs Real Madrid"" and filtering for 90+ and its clear"
Maybe nobody does hence the very long period of time 🤷‍♂️
"Unrelated to this stat in particular but there is a guy in Italy who posts stats like this and even madder (like that Zaniolo is the third player to score against Lazio with all the letters of the word ""Lazio"" in his name). He said that he has a database of every goal scored in serie A and the rest is just clever finding (in the case before, starting searching by Z which is the most uncommon letter)"
"Pep winning his first five clasicos is insane, what a manager"
">Kylian Mbappé scored the 1st free kick goal in a CdR final since Theo Hernández 2017 and the 1st for Real Madrid in such a game since Roberto Carlos and David Beckham 2004.


What? Did Theo play for Barca and I completely missed it?"
"Fitting, after Rüdiger tried to Franz Ferdinand the referee"
This shit is insane to read.
"Yeah, these matches are when this rivalry truly started. Incredible story."
Some things never change
Looks like some things never change lol.
Damn Real really have always been the team with the refs on their payroll.
[This guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Patterson_(footballer)) I suppose
This was the 6th ET according to another tweet. So I assume 4 times in between these 2 games.
I did. Im Vicente Martinez
"This is it. When this guy started in onda cero his boss saw the database and, according to ""mister chip"" said he was going to need a silly name to add charm to all of the numbers and data.

Next show was introduced as mister chip lol"
"16-2 in 5 games on agg. Real Madrid’s only 2 goals came in the 2-6 loss 💀

    2024/25     3-2 win
    2021/22     2-3 loss
    2010/11     0-1 loss
    1984/85     1-4 loss (on pens)
    1915/16     2-4 loss
    1915/16     6-6 draw <<< Vicente Martínez scored here"
"Finally El Clasico has kind of Pep vs Mou era vibes again. I know there were spicy Games, but as a non Spanish its been a long time I felt this way."
"Big respect to Ferran Torres, he really stepped his game up this season."
"All's well that ends well 😂

I think Rudiger would have actually knocked out the referee if he'd been let go. That man is genuinely insane."
Most intense Clasico since the Mou v Pep days
Rudiger is an embarrassment
I hope Rudiger sees a long ban for that. Disgusting player
Kounde you beautiful bastard thank you.
Rudiger lost it.....you can see it in his eyes...a major ban incoming
"Can’t believe I just spent 2+ hours cheering for Barca.


This Real Madrid team is some unprecedented levels of unlikeable"
So so easy to root against Real Madrid. So many unlikable players with a club culture that think they’re bigger than the sport
Omg Rüdiger is the absolute most embarrassing baller ever
"Banger game as a neutral, but shameful from the RM players involved at the end there.

Officials get a load of shit on here and other places, but officiating a final is an occasion for the refs too and the poor bloke looked miserable at the end. I hope there are appropriate sanctions for all involved."
Fucking pathetic by Madrid in the end
If Rudiger isn’t suspended then I don’t know what to say
"As a neutral I have to say this RM team is the most off putting one I remember watching football for 30 years, it's like watching a bunch of entitled 5 years old throw tantrums about existing."
Szczesny came out of retirement for this. What a turn of events for him.
Generational headloss from Real Madrid bench.
Rudiger and Vini have serious mental issues
"Both teams left a lot of chances on the table and will have questions to ask of their strikers. I don't think any sane person can blame Courtois for RM's loss. Credit to the team, they showed up and really made Barca fight for it. Now I can finally unclench."
Even Rudiger's bottle throw was off target
Unhinged behaviour from Rudiger. is that supposed to make the referee change his mind?
"Fuck Rudiger, proper piss cunt. I hope he wins fuck all and falls into obscurity. Absolute wank stain"
I’m over the moon but this game has definitely taken years off my heart
"There is not a more entitled club in football than Real Madrid.

Disgusting, unsporting brats."
Football has the magic power of bringing people together. I have never seen so many rival fans celebrating together for one team’s loss 😂
"You know, Güler in the second half was actually pretty dangerous with his crosses. Why don't RM play him more?"
Must be the most unlikable RM team ever.
Rudiger should try playing American football. That was a pretty decent throw. Either NFL or a psychiatric facility is a better place for him than football. edit: sp
This was Conmebol level shithousery
Rudiger is a bitch
"Vini, lucas, rudiger and jude got red cards, do this affect la liga matches?"
"Rudiger should maybe play handball because what a throw


Or maybe MMA?



Either way WHAT THE FUCK was this guy doing? 


That's gotta be a lenghty suspension right?



I get passion and anger and stuff but that's too much man"
That crashout was satisfying ngl
"Total embarrassment from Real madrid players.
Rüdiger should be banned for 10 matches or so for throwing the object."
IMO that lapse of judgement by Brahim Diaz for the Kounde goal was fatal..... Modric was fuming
"When Real Madrid as an club behave the way they do, then the victim bullshit is always going to filter down to the players.  It's pathetic.

Tonight highlighted, yet again, that VAR is a mess in it's current form.  Give teams challenges and let them force the referee go to the monitor and make a decision.  The ""clear and obvious error"" shit is too high a bar when it means that two exact same incidents can still result in two different outcomes because it's deemed a judgement call."
Stay tuned for the 3rd half on Real Madrid TV!
Modric is low key the only likeable Real Madrid player
"«Madrid still furious after the fulltime whistle»
What are they furious about? They lost the match fair and square."
"Sir, another remontada has hit the football world"
"That 2022 transfer market masterclass deserves to be celebrated even more. Time and again these players have saved our asses.  
Pedri, no fucking words for you man, was craving a thundercunt since ages and he finally delivered.  
Rare off day for Raphinha, shit happens we move on.  
RMTV and a few brainfarts in the second half sent this game to ET but we still prevailed, va-fucking-mos!!"
"Rudiger and Vini are seriously embarassing individuals, I don't think I've ever seen players actually throw things at the referee from the bench lmao"
Real Madrid victim complex is really something to witness
If only they played against Arsenal with that sort of fire from the 2nd half. Endrick on the wing was a waste and Brahim was beyond dreadful. Guler and Modric were great. A sorry end to the season that Perez bares the responsibility for how this season has gone
Embarrassing from Real Madrid
"Man the best clasicos lol in a while,  even than the last 2. 

So much tension and drama. Reminded me of Mourinho Pep era"
"Many la masia in starting eleven as an important core + smart buying + hansi flick made barcelona great again.

Made fans forgave all wasted money that management threw in last few seasons."
Black Pedri jersey: 7 consecutive wins while wearing since delivery!!! (Dropped points the only 2 times I forgot to wear it)
"A proper El Classico this.

- Cup Final
- Goals
- (Great) goals
- Drama
- Red cards"
"As a Rm fan I would say this: Ancelotti to Brazil, Vinicius to Saudi Arabia and rudiger to prison"
Lewandowski is as crucial as Raphinha. Tonight made that very clear. His presence around the CBs is enough. And 40 goals are 40 fucking goals.
Nice to see a bunch of shitheads getting served some justice.
Actually at a loss for words at how objectively insufferable this Madrid team is
"Great to see the entitled cunts lose. Get ready for a week of attacks against the refs again though, they will absolutely blame them for the loss."
This Real Madrid team has to be one of the most unlikable teams to ever exist.
Flick doesn't lose finals... absolutely incredible victory despite the circumstances
Funny how that piece of shit rudiger only gets sent off when he's off the field
"Fair play real madrid, never thought i would hate you guys more than barcelona, so unlikable its insane"
Ansu is like that kid that gets an A but doesn’t contribute to the group project 🤣🤣.
The next rmtv video is gonna hit like crack
I think the entire r/soccer follower list hate watched RM today
Lewy and Balde were injured. Balde would have cut open the left flank repeatedly.
"i dont understand Endrick…he is the shortest no. 9 ive even seen….why should a team throw him in the 70’ min,he wont reach long balls"
"Ancelotti, get ready to learn Portuguese, buddy"
"I'm surprised people are blindsided by madrid's shameful behavior. It's always been this way, they just managed to get away with it constantly"
"*” How can we blame this on the officials?”*- Madrid officials right now 

In all seriousness, shoutout to the ref. He did a heck of a job, all things considered. In my opinion, VAR should have had his back and sent him to the monitor for the potential Ferran penalty. 

Fuck you, Rudiger. What an embarrassing fake tough guy trying to fight a referee.  Absolute punk. Shame on Ancelotti, too, for just standing while he goes on, thus condoning it."
Counter-Terrorists Win
That headloss was insaaaannne😭😭😭
"Amazing game. I def didn't want that to go to pens after we took off like all of our penalty takers. Madrid really stepped up in the 2nd half, didn't expect that at all after the 1st. Guler should really be given more chances."
I used to pray for days like this
Second half mbappe sub might be the scariest thing ever
Pedri is the best barca player/itw he should be the one getting ballon dor shouts not the wingers
"i don't get how real were talking before the match about the ref being against them and wanting to get another ref ,2 pens should've been given to barca ,rudiger's tackle on ferran and possibly when a player pulled cubarsi's shirt on the corner(the one that hit the post)"
"Today was fucking epic in terms of football. First the Hoffenheim crashout, then Frankfurt decimating FC Redbull and now the Real Madrid crashout."
That’s what you call a crash out lmao. Can’t even blame the ref for the result and they led with 13 minutes to go - what will they say after this one
Rudiger at most gets a 1 match ban cos it was a ball winning attempted bottle throw
"Barca fell asleep at the start of the second half and paid for it. I'll admit it.

But the refereeing was absolutely disgraceful and this should have been another blowout win instead of the tight win it ended up being."
Real Madrid the collapse is insane
"Real Madrid are an absolute joke. Should be a lengthy ban for Rudiger. A dirty player who just completely lost it. 

Deserved win for Barcelona"
"I think this Madrid might be worse than Mourinho's.

They practicated terrorism, but it was the art of terrorism and everyone looked forward to El Clasico. This Madrid has sprinkles of entitlement and attitudes that make you genuinely dislike them.

If Xabi Alonso moves there, I wish him the best of luck with these Prima Donnas."
"When the hatewatch is absolute cinema 

*chef’s kiss*"
"After RMA tied it I really thought we were finished, exhausted and on our last legs we managed to score two goals and win the Cup. We should have had at least one penalty as well. This game just makes me dislike Real more, this was a winners mentality to survive and win when you're past the point of exhaustion"
Madrid comments yesterday definitely impacted the Match with the highly questionable decisions the ref made. They should be fined. What a shameful club and how low it has fallen. This match should not had been close at all if all the clear penalty and fouls got called today. Just half of them. Vinny literally cries the whole match lol
"Shameful display by Real Madrid, glad they lost."
"Can’t complain, this season of football has given us plenty of fantastic hate watch opportunities"
"I love him to heart, but man I really don’t think Raphinha deserves the balon d’or over Pedri"
The world of football and respect rejoice
ABSOLUTE FUCKING CINEMA
"- It's the kind of year where Barcelona has Real Madrid's number. Second final, second loss, and the first Copa del Rey final win over them in 35 years!
- Pedri's world-class strike, Mbappe scoring a direct free kick (not a drill!), Tchouameni's great header, Ferran Torres's cool finish (and that peach of a ball from Lamine) Kounde's winning strike, tackles, fouls, VAR, all the greatest hits! 
- Lamine Yamal is absurd. Assisted 2 of the 3 goals, and to think, he's this good now, he might get even better... that's scary! What a player
- Madrid's significant defensive problems, evident all season, showed again. And it's not just that they conceded 3 (again), but how they concede them
- The referee debacle and Madrid almost walking out of the final (classy) was enough of a disaster as is but hats off to him, he did his very best to call it down the middle, and wasn't having the diving shit. Gave out cards like candy 
- Antonio Rudiger's crash out at the very end was not shocking in the least 😂
- Barcelona wins the Copa del Rey for the 32nd time, and it's well deserved. One hell of a job Hansi Flick has done. And they're not done winning yet..."
Bunch of cunts in this Real Madrid team geez. Only ones that are classy and id want on my team are Modric and Valverde
Laporta has done it again. we need to give him props. Team is a powerhouse again thanks to him
"The arrogant shitty team lose, learn to lose."
"Rüdiger just screamed ""Hurensohn"" at the referee he better get banned for many games for this lmaoo"
This feels better than the 5-2 ngl
Were the players throwing shit at the ref
Rüdiger must be so proud! Setting the example like nobody else can. Amazing person.
That ref gonna need witness protection level security
Hate watch successful
That rudiger behavior is unacceptable
Apparently Lucas Vazquez got a red card? Not seeing any videos of what it was for online or on the subreddit
"Club cries all week and does a truly disgusting smear campaign against the ref.

Threatens not to show up to the match.

Ref was clearly conditioned for most of the match and allowed them to get to extra time.

Still lost the game and managed to act like deranged individuals at the end of the game.

Football heritage."
"I do have to give some respect to mbappe, he is still super lazy without the ball but today he changed the game, i had doubts that he was better than Vini when the season started but at this point there is no doubt"
"Both vasquez and rudiger deserved a 10 game ban. 
Vasquez Played a shit match and still has the audacity to act like a fucking clown."
I have been supporting Madrid for almost 15 years now. This is the worst I have seen them play/behave. I genuinely feel embarrassed to be a supporter today. We need major overhauls. On the field and off the field.
"Football wins!
Amazing game to watch, though nerve racking as a fan. Raphinha probably the only player who was not up to par for us today. Araujo showed what he can bring to the defence and the rest of the back four in the late game was immense all game. 

As a side note poor Fort, gets called instead of Araujo to get subbed on when Madrid takes the lead only for Flick to (correctly) swap back when it becomes 2-2."
To all the neutrals: remember this game the next time madrid complains about refs lmao
real madrid are fucking pathetic
"Rudiger called the ref „Hurensohn“.

It‘s german and means „son of a whore“."
Rudiger is so bad. Fine and ban incoming
My heart broke when I thought Lewandowski wasn’t there for the trophy lifting. Then I saw him
"!!!


I'm in heaven. What a huge win and comeback against a team that somehow was allowed to intimidate the ref.


I love this team."
Oh my god you guys have no idea just how good this feels. That Real Madrid TV bullshit actually worked but Barca still overcame all of it mentally. What a team Flick has built
"Reminder that:

1. RM BULLIED the referee before the match to get favourable decisions.

2. The referee ruled favourably throughout the game in favor of RM. How many fouls against Barca players were not called? PK for Cubarsi, Raphinha and Torres?

3. RM still got slapped up

4. Their players threw a fit and some of them legitimately tried to assault the referee that had been helping them all night"
Real Madrid have embarrassed themselves before and during the match. Now we just wait to see how they embarrass themselves afterwards.
Embarrasing statements and behavior from RM recently. chat shit get gangbanged
Vini and rudiger better get long bans for what they were doing at the end
The good ending
"for the biggest club in the world, Madrid are pretty pathetic."
"A great game for a Final & El Classico. True nail bitter. 
Great goals all 5 of them. Referee was under pressure, VAR messed up. But all in all a good game. 

And Rudiger is a disgrace."
"RM is officially pathetic!!!!!

They were not such sore loser during the Messi Ramos Pepe era... And we all know how Pepe played back then. 

Go cry in front of your RMTV."
"Embarrassment of a club, embarrassing 72 hours for sane Madrid fans."
"Negreira 1  
Bullies 0

Two more trophies to go 😎"
Real have one season where things don’t go their way and this is how they act pathetic
Rudiger is such an absolute idiot
"Rudiger needs to get like 10 months ban. Tries to beat the ref, wtf..."
"Not really fan of Barca but today being a neutral, had to support them rather than those crybabies. Didnt know RM players are this weak mentally. Rudiger needs to be banned for few matches."
That last clasico of the season will be ugly
Everyone seems to be getting a remontada now expect Madrid. Maybe they should learn to play and not just chuck ice at the referee
any idea when Lewa and Balde might come back?
Rudi is absolute disgrace of a player 🤡
"Rudiger is a fucking idiot, should've been a couple more red cards for Vini and co going on to the pitch and abusing the referee. Hopefully they look at that because referee abuse is out of hand !!!!"
Madrid making it really easy to dislike them
"Holy shit Real were disgraceful at the end. Hope Rudiger cops a career long ban for screaming death threats at the ref, he's a proper piece of shit."
"You sure you wanna go to this disgrace of a club, Xabi?"
What a game! Amazing job by all those exhausted players!
"Come on we had such an amazing fútbol display and you're talking about Rudiger.


Amazing final, Madrid demonstrating they're never out even in their lowest. 


Can't believe Jules fucking Kounde won it. 


This goes to the list of classic clásicos, what a match. "
Great game for neutrals bBut holy fuck how is it allowed to play a game of this calibre on a pitch like that?
Awful referee decisions and no VAR unless if it helps Real
"Madrid whined --> Ref Got Pressured --> Robbed of 2 Pens --> Barca Remontada in Extra Time.

What a perfect way to beat that disgrace of a club.

Edit: I also like how Mbappe changed the game for Madrid in the 2nd Half when he should've gotten a longer match ban."
I always thought it impossible for any club to be less likable than Milwall but here we are. Credit to Madrid that's a hell of an achievement.
Madrid really some hoes
Kounde and Cubarsi were fucking immense. Great team effort to rally back when things got tough. This squad can win everything this season
"Madrid can only blame themselves. 2 stupid mistakes on the last 2 goals, and the ridiculous conduct regarding the refs means that very few people will be upset that they lost"
Real Madrid is a shameless club
incoming RMTV rant video lol
Barca’s beaten Real thrice this season with one more matchup remaining 👀 Well deserved title win
What an absolutely insane final
Real Madrid actually lost their minds lol
So is Trent still going to Madrid ?
El futbol gana
"great match,our  young boys have so much heart. Valverde is such a great player, love a player like that in your team"
"1/3 


I owe kounde my balls"
"Yamal, my guy, what are those sunglasses? 😭"
"Arda was crazy good today tbh, Valverde too."
"Feels like since the departure of kroos and benzema 

no level head player left to command the team 

they are too emotional and it shows"
RMTV and chill tonight
Lol Flo having to shake the refs' hands after all that
Perez is a embarrassment to the sport up there shaking the refs hand. Absolute hipocracy
LOLLLLLLLLL
What's the flag Fermin is wearing?
I'm digging the mini trophies
Nice. Always good to see mudrid losing.
"Deserved win for Barca in the end, pathetic display from Real Madrid players as they realized they lost. The ref really REALLY wasnt against you this game."
"Hey, good sportsmanship by Vini. Did not expect that"
Barcelona are going to be truly knackered for Inter.
"Modric only gets my respect for Madrid players, whata alegend.

Fuck the rest"
April has been an awful month for Jude Bellingham and those on this sub desperately trying to convince us he is the best midfielder right now. First Declan Rice outclasses him in both legs where Arsenal played Madrid. Then Pedri comes on today and practically makes him irrelevant.
"If Lewa and Balde were fit this would have been a massacre.

Pedri for Ballon DOr, what a player. Kounde's goal was the cherry on top. Ferran was the clinical shark, love how much he's grown as a player.

Something is seriously wrong with Madrid this season. Not just in terms of playing style, but mentality as well."
"I don’t care if Madridistas downvote me, but get fucked Real Madrid.

And Rudiger… he shouldn’t see a pitch for a long time."
We missed Lewa and Balde a lot today. But I’m also very happy with how Ferran and Martin played today.
Kounde and Inigo Martinez MotM for me. Both of them were incredible. Raphinha can't play like this against Inter. Total disasterclass from him. There are no words to describe my hate for Rudiger. The bastard can make neutrals support the opposition simply because he's playing for Madrid.
Lovely capitulation at the end. This season has been nothing but a showing of petulant children in every aspect of Real Madrid from top to bottom. So good to watch.
There has to be consequences for these outbursts. Right?!?
"Fuck Rudiger, he looked like he wanted to kill fr. The audacity, always getting away with everything"
Mbappe goes to Madrid to have a trophy-less season... Lol! Supremely unlikable group of players
Rudiger deserves jailtime for that
been a couple years but it’s safe to say el classico is back
"Well deserved loss for Real and the referee. Honestly pathetic from both from start to finish. 

Hopefully this OT and game doesn't cost us too much in the CL."
Vini being a petulant cunt again
"Call me biased, but football won tonight after that awful showing of unsportsmanship from RM this week."
"Normally wouldn't congratulate Barcelona, but with the drama recently, I'm glad they won this match. Hopefully this childish bullshit from Perez comes with consequences, eventually."
Rudiger deserves to be suspended atleast 3 games but you know that won’t happen
I’ve never seen more sore losers
Football is saved
I'm actually surprised. When they made subs they became an actual decent team and caused us problems. Why didn't he do that from the start
"Pack this szn up man. Credit to Bellingham, Valverde, Tchouameni, Guler & Mbappe for getting us back in the game. Rudiger idk wtf was up with you today was fouling everyone and acted like a clown at the end"
Now I can unclench until midweek
"VAMOSSSS, this game is not good for someone with a weak heart like me lol."
Cry rudiger you little bitch
"I think I need my blood pressure checked after this game. Holy shit, the way RM played the 2nd half, I was worried Barca wouldn't come back."
Rudiger MOTM
Damn King Felipe VI is tall as hell. Dude should be hooping.
Guler is gonna be a hell of a player it’s scary
"Well done Barcelona, sportsmanship wins. Not saying Barca is the pinnacle of that, but the antics Madrid keep going to in order to blame everyone but themselves, intimidate and influence refs and keep their own little world intact are disgraceful.



Hell, it almost makes me happy Arsenal knocked them out of the CL and that's saying a fucking lot. Some things are bigger than rivalries, and the integrity of the sport is one of them - Madrid is trying to rip that apart more and more."
"This Madrid iteration is so unlikeable, perfect hatewatch material"
Not a Barca fan but glad they won. Real Madrid's behaviour ahead of the game was entitled and embarrassing.
"Barca didn't play very good, but they deserved this victory. RM only played for 20 mins. Too many yellows not given to RM players."
Ferran my beloved shark
"Well, if Barcelona win the league, they've well and truly dominated Madrid this season.

Rudiger is such an asshole."
"ggwp barca, madrid do not deserve a trophy after that embarrassing fiasco before the game was even played"
First time in my life I’ve rooted for Barcelona. Resl Madrid ‘s victim mentality has made them so unlikable im willing to look past all the childhood traums Barca gave me.
Rudiger should be banned for a month
"The audacity to put out referee content on the TV channel and again to throw objects at the Ref? Haha Madrid, entitled clowns"
Lamine is genuinely one of the best passers of the ball I've seen for us in a long time
"I'm not going to escalate this to the level of good vs evil, but man, are RM an unlikable club top to bottom. Makes me feel bad for the seemingly decent blokes on the team, like Valverde and Mbappe (who I think gets a lot of undeserved hate),"
Just got my son a yamal jersey
"Modric and Kroos spent years pointing out how whiny Barca is (which was true) , now this new generation Real Madrid is changing that image.  

 The surprising part is this seems come from the top, clearly Perez encourages this. Not just this week, the whole season they'been on the edge. Is the old man going senile?   
Real Madrid wants to be classy but nothing about this is classy. Quite the opposite."
The headloss lmao
"damn i got banned from realmadrid . well ,what a fucking shit show . shame on you madrid"
The amount of salt generated will be enough to fuel generations.
Vardrid are a disgrace to football. Horrible horrible team
All you need to do is rewatch the footage of those who abused the referee and then give punishments from that.
"Cannot believe Rudiger is loved as much as he is. He purposefully attempts to harm opponents, and has just thrown a projectile at a referee. 

There's no suspension that would be undeserved."
Funniest part was that Rudiger was crying about probably the most obvious foul in the entire game lmao
Premier League has nothing on Spanish football in terms of entertainment
First time I ever rooted for Barca just cuz this real team is unlikable as hell. Like the rich kid complaining because nobody laughed at their jokes.
"RM players complaining about referees, how ironic"
Couldn’t have happened to a nicer team I guess
That was an epic final.
Has RMTV posted anything yet
Great game. Didn't expect us to play so well. We could've actually won but fair play for that Kounde banger.
Rudiger you fucked up LOLOLOL
10/10 Final. Get fucked Madrid. 
"I down, 2 to go 💪"
Proper Clasico that
Biggest headloss of the year
Great match man
"Imagine losing on Kounde shot lol, lmao even. Well good luck on your next UCL match Madrid…oh wait"
"Kounde was immense even without the goal, he won every aerial duel coming his way"
Deserving winners
Reminder of when Rudiger yanked the arm and slapped a RM training staff. Massive cunt
"Real smartly gave a lot of space on Barca's left cause they knew Martin is a non threat. Allowed them to double Yamal and Kounde easier. 

There is a blueprint there for Inter."
Rudiger mickey mouse mentality
Honestly this season's rma team should be sent to Hague next to Milosevic
"Kounde is a goddamn legend.


Rudiger is a fucking psyschopath. This will sound bad, I hope someone doublefoots him in the future."
Kounde has saved football
"To be fair nothing will happen to Rudiger, look at Mbappe getting a pathetic one match ban for intentionally trying to break a leg"
"Real Madrid are a disgrace to the game. Toxic club, toxic players, toxic fans."
"The biggest cunts in football lost, today is a great day."
It really is easy to Root against this Madrid team
Real Madrid needs a therapist and an anger management coach. No class while wearing the badge
This is my last time watching a Madrid game that doesn't involve Arsenal or is an UCL final. So much whining and they clearly intimidated the ref over the week. Entitled bunch.
"The most hilarious thing is that Vini.... fucking Vini gets mad and throws bottles LMAO. Like bruh, you did jack shit whole game, how can you even get mad?

As for Rudiger, that's expected. Dude is a cunt and everybody knows that."
Blaming the ref at the end of this game is actually insane. Im not surprised tho. This is what happens when a Club enables that kind of behaviour. The result is players like Vini and Rüdiger.
Real Madrid have 15 UCL but they have 0 class and respect.
Why does the ref get a medal? His team lost
Seriously Real Madrid can go fuck themselves
The good news for Real Madrid is that they play us again in two weeks and they have a chance to finally take their revenge on us.
Arsenal broke Real Madrid
"So happy to see that disgrace of a club lose, well deserved."
Real Madrid embarrassing club
Denying Madrid of any glory for a whole year is way more worth than this Copa Del Ray
"Rudiger is unhinged, water is wet, etc

Can't wait for the next one in 15 days"
There was reports that Real Madrid were going to boycott the game due to the referee assigned to the game. Maybe they would have been better off boycotting than taking the L
"Let's all laugh at Madrid 😂😂😂
Shameless club"
Everyone hating on madrid lol
"Not his fault but thought Endrick was out of his depth. Unlike Guler or Brahim, who seemed comfortable."
Get fucked you absolute cunts
"Get fucked rudiger lmao.

Madrid players crying even though Barca should've easily had 2 penalties in the first half. Never change."
"These clowns in white got exactly what they deserved, horrible attitude seeping through that whole establishment."
I didn't like what Real Madrid TV did regarding the referee. I'm kind of glad they lost.
Football won.
Rudiger really represents what Madrid stands for as a football club. The most entitled bunch of players I've ever seen.
"Embarrassing club, embarrassing players."
Real Madrid have a fantastic team but never seen a worst pack of moaners in my life.
"It’s crazy though, Carlo had problems back in first half of 2015 and now it’s DéjàVu again in many ways. 

He gone !!!!"
Rudiger might be biggest cunt in pro football nowadays
Rudriger needs a ban. Fucking cunt.
Give me the vinny cry cam
"Fuck Real Madrid. So pathetic with the lead up to the game, glad football won."
"Well deserved to us. Not a great game given too many wasted opportunities. Ref sucked as expected from Spanish refs. 
This will make us even more tired for coming matches and game against Inter. Two more titles to fight for."
"Credit to Real Madrid they played better than I expected and made this game worrh watching, just a shame their behaviour off and on the pitch lately have been utterly disgraceful.

Congratulations to Barcelona they deserved it overall."
Madrid team barring fede is just insufferable.
"Great game as neutral. Pitch was diabolical straight after half time, so much slipping. And wow, Carlo has no control over his own players. At least 5 players should get sanctioned for how they behaved at the end."
"ARE YOU ENTERTAINED?! ARE YOU NOT, ENTERTAINED?!"
"All the El Classico Copa Del Rey finals that I have seen are classics and this game will definitely be one of those classics.  This was a lovely game for the neutrals and I think Barcelona overall deserved the victory. Fair play to Flick for drastically improving this team and no one expected to this team to challenge for a treble, the football they play is magnificient.

Vini cried about not winning a Ballon d'Or but he should do his talking on the pitch. Vini produced a stinker today, very underwhelming from him. Wtf is wrong with Rudiger? I expect him to get a long ban, disgraceful behaviour from him."
"On-field ref did a decent job, especially by Spanish standards, but VAR missed multiple pen fouls committed by Madrid"
From being the best team in the last season to being the most hated club... guess what was the turning point
How can you watch your team play like Getafe twice a week? Generational entitlement this is. Couldn't win with the help of refs lol. At least the ref did one good job by not sending off Modric.
I was kinda sceptical of Flick holding off substitutions till late but he knows what he's doing.
!flair :Beijing_Sinobo_Guoan_F:
Poodiger and Pinicius embarrassing behaviour.
Rüdiger is a psychopath wtf
Interesting ending
Fuck Madrid
What an actual psychopath rudiger is
Few things more satisfying than watching Rudiger take Ls while acting tough. Even as a Chelsea fan I hate this guy
Embarrassing shit from Real all round
"Disappointed for Real but what a final! In the end, Barça deserved it and Real players need to be more disciplined on every levels."
"KOUNDÉEEEEEEEE


Cue Europa League anthem

WOOOOOOOHHHOOOOO"
Ball. Don't. Lie.
Embarrassing behaviour
Greatest hate watch of all time
GG Madrid. Absolutely amazing game. This had everything from the build up to the end
Ref needs to go to his locker room asap and not leave until RM players have left
If Mbappe lands Madrid…
VISCA BARCA!!
"Personally, I’ll blame Papa Flo

He doesn’t like to spend money 💅💅💅guess Real’s poor"
Rüdiger was about to commit a crime
Rudiger about to curbstomp that ref like the arsenal match
Let's fucking go!!!!
Gg Madrid see you in two weeks time. 🤝
Ha ha madrid get stuffed
Where do you guys think Endrick is going on loan next season?
Can’t wait for Chiringuito
Summed up Madrids season with those two errors and defense.
My goal app just announced a red card for Lucas Vazquez. Anyone have an idea what that's about?
What is Lamal wearing!!!!!
Feck my bet was on penalti a favor real madrid
Carlo set Real Madrid up for failure by starting Rodrygo and Vasquez on the right wing and not subbing a defender in after they failed to make it 3 - 1
"Fuck Real Madrid, embarrassing by them."
A season ban won't be enough for Rudiger
Not a single title you cheating cunts!
"Rudiger is not getting suspended 

If anything that red card is going to be rescinded"
"Today football won. I will be tired by next week with seeing the post of how real Madrid got robbed,  cries, and complained a lot. It's not going to be funny how a big club acting like a child."
"*""You've saved me so much fucking money, kid""*

-Joan Laporta, probably"
"Oh my days Real Madrid is so fucking pathetic

They are Vought in real world."
"This has to be the most demoralizing clasico loss for RM this season, in the other games they didnt stand a chance, but today they looked quite good in the 2nd half and almost won the game if not for Lamine and THE MFING SHARK"
This team is the sorest of losers. Lost even after getting so many favorable calls.
Bellingham and Pedri are 2 generational players and their rivalry will be the real spice of the next Clasicos
Real Madrid trying to play victim of referees is just mind blowing to me
I don't understand penalty was overturned. Ferran and cubarsi clear penalty not even checked. Still rudiger is throwa bottle and invades the pitch
I don't understand why we didn't train to beat their offside trap - which in theory should be their biggest weakness. Either that or Flick is doing some weird 200 IQ juju
"Rudiger being trash as always, glad that Barca won tonight. Justice was made"
"Brahim casually just dropped one of the biggest stinkers in El Clásico history, what a horrible player he is, Jesus Christ."
Bellingham has the emotional control of a toddler
"This real Madrid team has so many terrible personalities, Vini and bellingham are especially hard to watch with all the things they have to say and rudiger is just trash , atleast Pepe and ramos became much better with their attitude on the field after they turned thirty 


I Hope the next final isnt this fucking intense, the heart cant handle it"
"It’s crazy how it’s almost a prerequisite to be an awful person/dirty player to don the Madrid shirt. Especially at CB. Ramos, Pepe, Asencio, Rüdiger, Vini, Mbappe, Ronaldo, etc etc"
"RM should stop playing for a season or two, cool down, and come back with the right head and attitude. Now they are just a bunch of narcissists who make everyone miserable."
2 penalties robbed from Barca and Real Madrid still have the audacity to complain about the ref 💀
Madrid players should get lengthy suspensions for that crying to the ref. Honestly he was ready to throw the bag of ice at the ref is coaches didn’t hook the arm. But it’s tebas and co 1 game suspension max for Madrid
"Calmest Rüdiger moment

Real Madrid are such a classless team. Beautiful to see them lose and embarass themselves. Rüdiger should be in a mental hospital."
Entitled af. We all love and enjoy shithousery. But some folks at RM cross the line so freaking often. Carlo is going to get all the blame but this iteration of RM team is a disgrace. And the bigger disgrace is their fans defending this uncivilised behaviour.
"Best team won.

Real Madrid fail once again to show dignity, class and humility. Such an unlikeable group of very bad losers."
"Watched el classico after a long time due to the intense heat. Fun game. But damn, is the quality way worse than a decade ago"
always believed in the shark since his freekick goal
"The old psycho eyes came out in full force, havent seen that in a while"
He literally threw a big ass block of ice to the ref. He should be banned for atleast 6 months
I say let him. Gets him a months if not year long ban AND probably a nice payday for the ref in damages!
Ref should’ve stepped up to him
Real Madrid has the biggest cunts... it's unbelievable
Flo is an embarrassment
"half their bench should receive suspensions, they all absolutely lost their minds"
"Not just him. Vini and others were also throwing stuff on the pitch. They should all get banned for multiple games for this nonsense

If anything, the ref favored Madrid this game. They are so pathetic.

EDIT: I just rewatched the video and looks like Vini and others were just throwing their hands up in the air. Looked like they were tossing stuff the first time I saw it

EDIT 2: I bet Rudiger knows he won't be able to play for a while due to injury and was trying to act all tough to seem like a badass to the fans since the ban won't matter"
Their whole club is.
Madrid is an embarrassment. Rat club.
He wears white. He's not getting a long ban. Mbappe got a one match ban for his tackle.
"La Liga is fine when them threatening the ref, if anything they'll reward Rudiger for throwing stuff at him"
"No way he gets a ban. They’ll prob blame the ref, even though the ref’s decisions clearly favored Madrid."
The referee report will say it was not malicious.
Genuinely looks like a psycho. Should be handed a long ban
Not a chance in hell
You know something's up when both Arsenal and Chelsea fans are saying this.
"Yeah, I went into this with absolutely nothing, what a bunch of cunts"
They’ve built a team filled entirely with players who think they deserve to win simply because they’re wearing a RM logo.
"The entire infrastructure feeds on itself to make this mess. Fio, their in-house media apparatus, their pet newspapers, their signing philosophy, etcetera. I don't see how they unfuck this mess. But they win enough, and make so much money, that I don't know if they really have it incentive to do so anyways."
"Few clubs unify fans against them like Madrid does. Get fucked, cunts."
Biggest most successful club in the world and somehow always the victim
Full of belief that they have the divine right to every award and competition. Troubled children
Fucking pathetic by Madrid this entire week lmao
"Whole club has been pathetic this week, if only these guys had the same passion when actually playing"
"This isn't football, it's LaLiga"
The whole club should be banned. Absolute embarrassment to the game and Spanish football.
Vini didn’t get shit either.
"Arbeloa, Ramos, Salgado, Pepe, Carvalho, Ronaldo and Di Maria was pretty unlikable 2011."
"As a RM fan I agree, which I’m sure most RM fans do. Really hope for some massive changes next season."
"Only 30 years?

This Real team is the most entitled whiney bunch of weasels to ever play football."
Even before the ball was kicked today lmao
Most entitled bunch of crybabies in football lmao
No they’re just le competitive!!! Cringe ass behavior from grown men.
"Don't forget Vazquez, he's an absolute clown, not fit for the captain's armband nor to even play for Madrid."
THAT BITCH VINI BETTER NOT ASK FOR A RAISE AFTER STINKING OUT THE WHOLE YEAR!!!!
I think Vini’s personality really helps him when the club is playing well but hinders him and everyone else when they aren’t
"Oh yeah me too, pretty sure my cardiologist would ban Barca games for me if he knew what they do to my heart"
"So true

Today I feel city arsenal"
I've never really cared about them either way tbh. But the way they and their fans reacted over Rodri winning the balondor over Vinicius really made me change my mind. Because they're such frequent winners they've become so entitled to expect every trophy every decision and every balondor to go their way. Proper embarrassing some of the stuff you read.
Kicked the corner for Tchou’s goal didn’t he?
I agree. Him and Bellingham brought it tonight. Good job for them all.
Some players good as a sub not as a starter. Maybe Ancelotti see that way
Followed closely behind by every other Madrid team ever
"The Mourinho team was definitely worse. Far more violent on the pitch, and the most petty and uncharismatic version of Mourinho we've seen."
"I don't know man, the competition is crazy high."
"The write up in the Ref report says   


>Throwing an object from the technical area without reaching me

Maybe not QB, but he could try linebacker or safety?"
The RFEF might very well hand out some bans—especially after how their club acted this week
Especially them holding him back like some fucking untrained pitbull looking at a toddler 
Put him on long throws lol
"I feel so bad for the ref, imo he was biased towards Madrid and they're still probably gonna rip him apart"
Wait till you find out about him covering ass of a Croatian mobster in court.
Been saying that for a *while*
Guler is pretty chill also
"Valverde, Tchouameni, Rodrygo and Güler too, but yeah in general I find it hard to keep supporting, when there is Rudiger and Vinicius there"
Couldn't resist blaming a teammate after teeing up Kounde.
"No, you see, the ref had it against them and was trying his hardest to get them to lose."
"Yeah, Raphinha's decision-making and final ball weren't quite there tonight, but we move on."
Just want to take a moment to appreciate Padre Alemany
Raphinha has looked a bit off for a few games now..I hope he turns it around we desperately need it
"I think everyone shares the blame.

Some key players are no longer producing great results (see Vini - and Rodrigo’s lack of goals on the past few months)

Our defense were constantly injured and there was no proper replacements - fuck Perez for not doing anything on the defense. We have to put several midfielders to plug the hole in the defense.

Our midfield lacks creativity. It’s time to let go of Modric and strengthening the midfield.

And Don Carlo’s gameplay is becoming too predictable. He just keep playing the same favorit players which hinder the growth of the youngsters and tires the veteran players. 

Anyway - this season is gone. It’s time to move on."
Except Flick and Ancelotti are incredibly honourable and classy in their rivalry.
Don’t forget both teams getting mowed down like flies in the second half
"I dont think people understand just how much Raphinha gets fucked over by both Lewandowski and Balde being out. Those are pretty much the 2 players (together with Lamine) that have helped him reach the numbers he has. Ferran doesnt really know how to drag players away properly or making them focus on him. Martin is a complete non factor offensively. 

It just gives players more freedom to focus on Raphinha. He isnt the type of player who can just dribble them and move on, so its actually a pretty big issue that 2 of the players who take a lot of the attention off him arent there"
Is he injured?
"Although I wonder what they’ll cry about, ref almost gave them the game."
I can't believe I'm agreeing with a pool man. RM unite us all
You can really tell by how basically everyone is rooting agains them
And they all were successful
Massively underrated on the left side…
He actually has a pretty good track record of scoring winners when he comes on late as a sub. I was actually nervous af when I saw him coming on.
"He can run and shoot a rocket, but he didnt touch the ball lol"
Licking your lips aren't you
"Regardless of the result or your opinion of the refereeing decisions throughout the game or what club you support, I really hope La Liga (and other FAs where this crops up) admonish clubs who do the shit madrid did in the buildup to this match in the future.

Completely inexcusable behavior, and it's ridiculous that it's just gonna fly."
"We all thought the main ref would be the one influenced, but they just bribed the VAR officials"
"Rudiger, Vini and some others too. You can see it all on the replay!"
"Two possible explanations: either they truly have victim mentality and believe that referees favour other teams instead of the opposite (which, what a level of delusion that would be) or it's a tactic to add extra pressure even though they know refs already mostly side in their favour. 

Either way, pathetic."
"This wasn't the first time they put out such stuff on a ref using RMTV right before a game. It works to add extra pressure on the ref, make them second guess any decision vs rm. Clearly worked too. The tactic still somewhat backfired pr-wise because the ref aired out the dirty laundry publicly which made them throw a tantrum."
"This is what they always do. Always have done this historically.  

Why do you think Barca fans like myself absolutely despise playing against them? People are like, it's the classico, you have to love it. No, this type of trash behavior is disgusting and why should I look forward to it? If we never played the White Trash club again, that would be soon enough.  This is one of THE  most toxic matches I've ever witnessed. I got so sick I had to turn it off after the Turtle equalizer. 

Today was a disgrace by the white trash. They take any joy out of the sport when Barca plays against them when they know they are inferior.  And that happens before every important derby."
The ref was scared to get it wrong
"It's all because of Perez honestly and some of the fans. They enable this shit and then you have entitled cunts instead of football players like Rudiger or Vini.

The club needs a major revamp from the grounds up."
"Don’t forget that normally mbappe should be suspended for 3-5 matches, but he only got 1 and he was the difference maker today."
Having three front runners on our team is a good problem to have my guy.
"I was particularly impressed by Yamal's defensive efforts today, even at the end"
"The spirit of Ramos lingers, making sure everyone continues to break the man, not the press"
"Running on the field during that Garcia foul at the end, which is crazy since Vini did that too and I don't think he was carded"
He created more chances in the first 20 min of the second half than the rest of the team in the whole first
"What Rudiger attempted was actual assault, the ban should be even longr than 10 games"
"Balde should be ready soon (he was already training), might miss Inter first leg though. 

Lewandowski im really not sure. Personally think well be lucky if he plays in the UCL semi final at all"
Balde should hopefully be good to go for the Inter game. Lewy more like the 2nd leg
"Arda Gulers corners almost feel like penalties lol.

So dangerous every time I was holding my breath."
Andaulsia flag.
"At least we will get an extra day of rest. And they’re also running on fumes, as evidenced by their last 2 games"
"You know things are dire when Courtois, of all people, looked as one of their classiest players lately"
As a Barca fan and avid Jude hater. He was terrific today and in the second half truly outplayed Pedri. For the first time in a long assss time Pedri lost a ball which lead to several dangerous chances
Murderer of the Match?
Should be banned for a season if he was the one who threw something at the ref.
"he's also an amazing shot creator but his finishing needs work, all part of the process though"
"They will lose la liga in that clasico, so 3 trophies lost directly to barca"
They brought it on themselves tbf
They're a very hateable team
Entitled is the perfect word for this current Real Madrid team. Its a shame.
They are so easy to hate.
Lol Rudiger and Vasquez got red cards off the pitch for throwing tantrums at the end
"Same as the first classico this year, Mbappe 10 offsides. Idk how we let them get away with such a high line."
Raphinha was also terrible today.
"I mean, those teams had some of the greatest players of all time. Hard to compare quality with those monsters."
[It's been a full month](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Wf54GmPSuB.1OlG_USoHjw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYwMDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/260bf4e5f83ce3e7f866d78c6617aea2)
Hasn't that ref been through enough this week 😂
"If he actually knocks out a ref, there's no way he's not banned for life."
"Whole club is, they’ve acted so fucking immaturely from the Ballon d’Or ceremony to now.

Referee intidimation is disgusting, I’m happy they lost."
"It's really this, there's no way this isn't coming down from the very top. The stuff about the refs, the ballon D'Or. Perez is in full Karen mode"
Nothing’s gonna happen. The ref will get punished instead.
">I bet Rudiger knows he won't be able to play for a while due to injury and was trying to act all tough to seem like a badass to the fans since the ban won't matter

He didn't look like someone who in that moment could have had particularly strategical thoughts"
Whining SOBs
"Club, players, and fans. Pathetic all around"
still boggles my mind
For his attempt to end his opponents career*
"""He was going for the (ref's) ball, one game ban."""
"Yea no one likes a bully!

And even less when that bully — while being the strongest, most successful entity — constantly claims to be victimised by those with a lot less power than it.

But enough about politics!"
"This will sound stupid but at least cunts like Pepe and Ramos were trying to break Messi's legs when losing not the fucking referee. 

Imagine being a kid in high school getting harassed from other kids because your father is used as an excuse by a bunch of entitled hundred-millionares for not being good enough and losing 1 game out of 100."
Don’t remember them whining and complaining to this level. Really embarrassing club. Mbappe and Courtois look like the only ones not taking part in the bitching
"it's really sad, I grew up as a kid watching the Hiero/Carlos/Raul era in the late 90s early 00s CLs, it's what get me into football long term."
It was an inside joke between friends
"Notice how he didn't say liverpool though

Real one right here"
Yeah he did. He has a lot of potential.
Shades of Pepe and Ramos...
man of the match for Real right there
"Yeah, because it was Brahim's fault."
Pass had enough power to get to Brahim if he wasn't backpedaling and trying to turn blind lol
He hasn't been the same after the Argentina game. Hope his confidence comes back soon.
Hamstring issue. Hopefully back for 2nd leg of UCL semis
yup got injured last game which sucks since we really should have rested him
Absolutely disgusting isn’t it! Lol
Every Neutral woke up and felt Barcelona today.
they practically invite us to hate them
"I was asking on this sub a year ago why Fifa, UEFA, the Spanish football federation, or SOME governing body hadn't done anything about it. It's wild that it took this long for it all to blow up as it did."
"It’s a win-win for them. If they win they’ll say they overcame the odds with the refs on Barcas side. If they lose they’ll say see we knew it was what we were saying it was. As you said, pathetic."
Better get it wrong for Barca than get it right and anger madrid
his original position in la masia was actually a left back believe it or not
"I noticed too—kid's worth god knows how much, has a man of the match performance, and he still tracks back and presses in extra time 🔥"
Lewa generational performance next el classico confirmed
So this was a home final for him. Cool.
At least 10 WC winner final starters. I would say they were pretty good.
bro thinks hes The Undertaker
"Hey I'm thinking of him, imagine how much he could earn through just a single, short bit of pain!"
I'd hope so but you never know with this farce of a club tbh
Yeah if he could knock out the ref and be back by December I’m sure he’d do it
It's actually a disgrace. Nothing royal about those lads.
"He's shaken up and clearly going through something internally. I wish him a speedy return to form.

Forca barca."
"I think it was the absence of Balde that limited him. I mean, he did help us win against Celta few games ago"
Tbf its not uncommon for young players to change positions as they develop and grow. Araujo used to be a striker when he was younger.
No that's pretty royal behavior. Act like shit and expect everything to still be good for you.
"Getting red-carded *after* a game is so absolutely ridiculous that the clubs should fine players for it. Nothing you say can change the outcome, and when you're someone so utterly important to the team like Bellingham is, you cannot be losing your cool like that."
Jude? I swear it was Vini.
"Are these applicable to the next LaLiga games? Losing Vazquez, Rudiger and Bellingham to straight reds after the game ended and missing the next match is as good as winning the final IMO, considering the title race"
How the hell does Vini keep getting away with his clear dissent and xPAR (points at ref) so many times? Genuinely baffling
Vasquez? Advantage Real
seriously shocking how bad of a look real madrid gives nowadays. i mean they always had divas but noone was bigger as real madrid the club itself. now it seems the bow for everything a player wants and defend every action. today it seemed they had five players who going for puberty atm. its insane how unprofessional and narcissistic they act. and behind that there is a manager who jumps that bandwagon and blames every referee he sees. no real idea just a couple of overhyped names and at this point its just embarrassing…
what those players did HURLING objects at the referee needs to be front page news. Who else would dare act or even think about doing this to an official in a professional capacity?
Entitled cunts
Do reds from the Copa final continue over to La Liga?
"While the falloff in performance is debatable due to playing a different position, we have to really study Jude's falloff in character. I think that due to his great first season, he got a lot of PR and now with some struggles this season in a new position, that PR has somewhat fallen off of him being the best player in the world. 

I don't think he has handled not being the one scoring all the goals well. I've seen him curse at refs and commit some fouls that were worthy of a card. A good example is how he shoved Timber last week against Arsenal and then had some nasty fouls on Declan Rice.

Sure a lot of this sub will claim he is the best midfielder right now but clearly the lack of goals compared to last season has gotten to his head in some way."
go on trent. that gonna be your heritage.
All time melt down
Bellingham has become such a cunt since joining RM. He was not doing shit like this while playing for BVB.
Why is Vazquez such a whiny loser? I get the rest bc they are stars. But LV is a bum
Bunch of cry babies
Rudiger needs a lengthy ban and some counselling
Rudiger needs a lengthy ban and some counselling
A season to forget for RM
"Would be really funny if they got suspended in the la liga, they play us in 2 matchdays. Except Vazquez, he can serve 1 but keep him in the starting 11 for next one"
"Jude is out of control. I love him, but he's picked up this kind of Real Madrid arrogance whereby he can't accept losing fair and square. E.g. when Rodri won the Ballon d'Or and they boycotted the ceremony or making polemics around the referees. They lost fair and square and should take it like men, not lil bitches."
Wtf did Bellingham do? He didnt even approach the ref. Did he yell fuck off again?
"Bellingham was losing his head since the first half, not even surprised he was sent off at the end."
Yeah unless this comes with a long suspension then this is just a slap on the wrist since it wont be served until next year. So of course itll just be 1 match or rescinded.
"Bellingham was losing his head against Arsenal in both games and didn't contribute shit to Real's game. I understand he must have talent for RM to have signed him, but all I have seen is whinging and thuggery."
"Vini was the one who ran into the pitch along with Lucas, but he wasn't sent off for that, 

Bellingham is being red carded for something he said to the referee after the match finished.

Edit: apparently he was confronted by both Vinicius and Bellingham, but he only carded Jude"
"I was surprised with Vini’s attitude post game considering how he reacts sometimes, hope he continues like this"
"I really don't care. Jude deserved the red card already around the 60th minute. I really like Vini a lot more than Jude. At least Vini behaves like a cunt to stir the oponent, fair game. Jude is just an entitled prick and a really dirty player."
"Vini was with Lucas, of course he escapes a red. Bellingham apparently aggressively approached the refs separately and had to be held back. Delightful lad"
Not the red i dont think but if they get bans over 4 games it will carry over to la liga. At least that is what people were saying about mbappes red a couple weeks ago.
cause he can play the rascism card
It’s insane. I actually hate them almost as much as Liverpool
"You honestly think that was a foul?  It's clear he goes down to buy it, and team is trying to tie the game.  And it's a classic."
"only if it's over 1 match ban iirc, but real madrid rarely get over 1 match, even if mbappe tries to kill someone"
Having to feed two spoiled brats should be heavy on the mental side.
That's nothing new. Back at Dortmund he kinda accused the ref of being bribed in the match against bayern
IIRC he was really disliked in the dortmund dressing room for being a dickhead. This is how he has always been. I just wasnt noticeable last season since its easy to seem humble when you’re winning
"I think he also gets too carried away and affected by the shit ""us vs the world"" victim mentality from the board and management. He has to be really careful going forward."
"That's how he's always been, Dortmund just gets a lot less press attention than Real. He seems to have a cocky entitled streak to his character, which was hidden by his personal and Dortmund's PR teams by only drawing attention to his more ""respectful"" moments.

Tbh I think it fits Real Madrid, most players that play for them need to have at least a bit of that cockiness to succeed there imo. It lends itself well to all the clutch and black magic moments, plus it is very marketable if you consistently, and Perez clearly knows it."
And he didn’t do shit against us in either of those two legs 😂
He's still playing well imo.
"mbappe's behavior is already worse as well. Constant diving, dirty fouls, crowding ref. He wasn't this bad before. That dirty club rots everyone's brains."
I mean he was in a scandal for strongly hinting at referee corruption….
"Mentality midgets as soon as they don't win, it's so easy to just not blame the refs and accept that some go against you."
Theyre not the younger squad. Just cunts.
this was for an incident after the game had ended
He actually did XD 
"Let's wait and see, maybe he did it with respect so it should be all good."
He confronted the ref after the match and probably said something nasty.
Look at him during Pedri's goal
"He played very well the second half, honestly I think he was being more incisive than Vinicius and Mbappe despide those two being more flashy... but then, if something doesn't go like he wants, he loses it.

The whole season has been like that, he's always complaining, crying or even kickinv VAR monitors, lol 

He was losing it 100% during the match."
Was it said respectfully?
Probably didn’t wanna be on the racist list
Yeah he came over to all the players to congratulate them. Actually gained a sliver of respect back from me
vini is a cunt but hes much better than other real players
That's how he is. He leaves all his fight inside the pitch but outside he's a class act and gentleman.
"Nah I don’t care who it is, I was just a bit confused. Unacceptable from them though, they lost the plot today."
"Even as an England fan, he annoys me. He'll dive after losing the ball and then strop, complaining to the referee instead of running back to support the team. Insanely talented footballer, but attitude stinks"
"Because he got red in La liga and CDR final was 4 matches ahead that's why, not because of lengthy suspension. But from the rules, if the competition finishes or team leaves the competition the suspension carries on in La liga. But we are adults here and we know how things work, rudiger will get 1 match ban and others will get away with it, cause it is Real"
Piss off with that. Comments like this do nothing more than belittle the actual racism that Vini faces and justifiably calls out.
You can royally fuck off
Yup I knew the racists would use this (justified) Madrid hate to shit on Vini fighting against racism.
"Yeah, he only got mowed down 5 times and came off injured without a call this game, ref is obviously terrified of the racism card"
"Even if it’s not a foul, you can’t react the way the Madrid players did"
They were clearly trying to play the ball. 1 match ban.
Wasn’t that a ref that was previously banned for match fixing though?
Tbf that ref was fishy lol
"I did not know much about the Dortmund days. Yikes, it is only this season I am finding dude is as bad as Vini with the antics but damn that is great PR if we never hear of it lol."
I remember people on Twitter denying this rumor with all of their being by posting pics of him celebrating with his teammates after a goal or his farewells. Oh and the England national team camp during the euros with the nonstop reports. Is there smoke without fire?
Hey he did give Rice a nice hug in-between the legs lol
"Not when the competition gets tough (Liverpool, Arsenal, and Barcelona)."
"Grats on the Copa win, decho. :) hopefully the other two trophies follow too. be smiling, tc senor."
Such a dead joke especially considering that’s clearly not what Bellingham said lmao
Oh ffs why does he need to do that shit again. Its his third red card for complaining to the ref
"always, its real after all"
"No, it was an inside joke made towards his teamates"
"I mean a man eventually calms down though. I have to admit to saying horrible shit to teammates many times while playing and receiving equally horrible shit, but everything is forgotten afterwards"
"he actually seems like a decent guy off the pitch, just a hot head on it"
What people say is on and off the pitch vini jr is completely different
"Sometimes he has some nice gestures but gets rattled way too easily, nevertheless he never hides his true self, we can’t say the same about Jude for example"
Let’s not go too far. He didn’t show up to the Ballon d'Or Ceremony. He’s not always classy off the field
"Let's not forget all the Balon'd Or fiasco. He is not a cunt off the pitch but definitely not ""gentleman"" either."
"He won most duels out of anyone on the pitch, had most successful tackles and ran the most? He had a great game."
"The issue is that he calls for racism both when it is present and when it is not.

Nobody argues that he should not be facing the abuse. At least noone sane"
Both things can be true at the same time
"He faces racism because he is a piece of shit though, not saying it is ok in any way, fuck that, but it is the truth. There were many great black players in Spain, but this is the first time this shit is widespread, it's for a reason, he is one of the most unlikeable players I have ever seen."
ref was thirsty and rudiger was just giving him ice and bottles
"Yes he had a past of it. And after 2 controversial penalty decisions (honestly I don't know anymore if these really were controversial, I just read it up again) he made hints at the ref being bribed"
Yeah in Madrid’s favor lmao
"He was fined 34.000€ by the DFB for this, was lucky to escape a ban"
He was really good today
He was the best player on the pitch today
He was maybe the best player on the pitch today. But sure go off
"Congrats to you as well man. And yeah, let's hope we have the legs for Inter in 3 days."
"Maybe that's who he's always been, not that nice of a guy?"
"Sure but within the context of the situation it paints a different light on him imo. I didnt see anyone else personally go to congratulate everyone, especially because half of them were still throwing tantrums like Rudiger and Jude. 

It shows that for Vinicius it really can be just all left on the pitch and hes a decent guy off it whereas Rudiger and Jude are just cunts through and through."
It was probably a perez diva decision
"As if he had a choice? Lol. That is on Madrid having absolute no class, if you employer says something you go along with it."
I don't see the correlation here... he's saying Jude is a cunt and you're correcting that by saying... he played a good game?
Played really well in midfield today.
Him standing still with his hands on his head while Pedri initiates and finishes a counter says otherwise
"Only after the double modric guler subs did he show his usual level, he wasn’t anywhere near for the first 50min of the game"
">and when it is not.

When has he done that? I really don't remember such a time where he played racism card. Everytime he brought it up, there were actual incidents to back it up."
"Nah. He only talks about racisn when he is a victim of racism. Its just racist kids on the internet are suggesting he blames everything on racism and use him being outspoken about racism to say thats all he talks about.

And it such a shitty thing because that way you can use all those times he ""cried racisn when nothing happened"" to attack him when he is talking about this issues."
"I do not agree with this, Vinicius whines about some things but he has never lied about facing racism as far as I know"
"Fuck off if you think he calls out false racism. 


He might be a cunt on the field but hes class off it."
"Wrong, he faced racism first, spoke up against it, faced backlash, didn't back down. Fans figured out it was an easy way to rile him up, teams like Valencia blamed him for dancing and claimed there was no racism, which descended him into complaining a lot more and becoming bitter. 

He was not like this when he joined Madrid, or for some time after."
They were talking about the ref in Dortmund vs Bayern match
I doubt he was even Madrids best player tonight
"Delusion is a hell of a drug, he didn't win man of the match lol"
Guy thinks vini has any amount of power over Perez decision
He is insinuating that he doesn't run back or kept losing duels today. I said thats not the case at all .
"


Completely disagree. You think Id have any issue telling you if he wasnt good? Vini was shit, Rodrygo was shit. Modric was bad. Bellingham had one of his best games for us this season. If you didnt see that who cares."
"Don't expect a reply. People go blind with their hatred and fandom. I'm not a Vini fan in the slightest but to claim he is crying ""racism!"" when there isn't anything there is asinine. If anything we don't hear about the dozens if not hundreds of instances he has let shit go because to call out each and every flagrant thing would end up being his fulltime job."
"I dislike Vini a lot. He has a terrible attitude and acts like a victim. I think he does get away with his antics frequently. 

But that a just incorrect IMO. I can't think of a single time he brought up racism in a time to excuse his behavior or that didn't make sense."
So who was?
"Ferran was not the best player on the pitch either lol. 

Jude was most definitely the best Madrid player on the pitch, it's not even debatable."
Was he the guy on the first goal who gave the ball away then stood in the centre circle with his hands on his head like a cunt
These takes on Jude this game have me dumbfounded. Jude was immense this game
We have such racism issue in stadiums that he might as well randomly pick a match and be right...
Valverde and Güler were pretty good I thought. Fran Garcia and Mbappe did well too.
"""like a cunt"" wtf is wrong with you"
"Despise Madrid and their antics but have to agree. Jude skinned Pedri at least twice (by my count) to create big chances and his sliding challenges were top class, apart from the one near the touchline."
"First two were good, specially Guler. Mbappe vanished after his goal. Either way, Jude was a step above every Madrid player. Him, Cubarsi, and Kounde were probably top 3 players in no order."
"Sub is just blinded by Madrid hate right now. 


He should just learn to control his emotions, hell, RM needs to."
"**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**
  

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
Why was there no VAR review of Cubarsi being held at the far post when he's inches away from tapping it in?
Isn't that a pen?
The bitching and whining by Madrid already paid off. This is a stone-cold penalty and they just completely ignored it.
Obvious pen.
"Pen?

Btw is someone going to talk about the way tchoumeni tackles?"
Can we talk about how the ref doesn’t want to use cards even though Real Madrid is playing worse than Getafe?
How is that challenge on the back post not a penalty lmaooooo fuck Real Madrid
This is why Real Madrid pressures the refs
Scaring the refs really worked
Is there VAR for this match? Because I'm having doubts...
The ref is clearly overcompensating to not look biased against Madrid. All that fuss made by Madrid is actually working as the ref is subconsciously favoring them.
That’s the most obvious penalty if I ever saw one. Ceballos is literally wrestling Cubarsi to the ground.
"I dare someone tell me that isn’t a pen on Cubarsi there.

Ceballos isn’t even looking or playing the ball at all."
That’s a pen. You can’t just hold down someone on a corner like that.
How is that not a pen! And wtf is Frenkie doing there smh
Ceballos just holding on forever and nothing happens
Perez masterclass. He obviously managed to influence the ref with his shenanigans
Chat is this penalty?
Ceballos playing rugby
this is more like clear pen on Cubarsí
"Madrids plan worked, ref is clearly afraid to give any decision against them. This is a clear pen."
"More like, dismissed penalty for cubarsi."
"Ceballos is such a little shit, so many fouls all game and this. Neutral here but Madrid make it so easy to loathe them with their antics"
Ask ChatGPT - what is a penalty?
That was an obvious penalty. It would've been a goal if Cubarsi doesn't get his jersey grabbed.
successful campaign by RMTV. fcukoffffff madrid
Ceballos wanted Cuba’s shirt already
Bro imagine that went it. It would have definitely been one of the best El Classico goals of all-time
"You can tell by how fast he gave vini the pen the ref wants no smoke with real anymore. Also, not giving like 5 yellows in real."
"That should be a Barcelona penalty, no? If he isn't being pulled down he taps that ball in after it comes off the post..."
The ref pressure has worked tremendously. That’s two penalties not called and he had zero issue handed out Vinicius’ before the offside flag saved us.
Just clearly a penalty.
2 clear pens not given to us
Braindead from Ceballos what is he doing he got very lucky there
They must have silently changed the VAR ref to Florentino Perez cause Ceballos is literally holding Cubarsi with both hands to prevent the easiest tap in
Is there no match thread? Can't see it
Didn’t Arsenal get a pen for that just the other week
Stone wall penalty. Real Madrid TV finds its’ way to be influential. Disgusting stuff
"Clearly RM & Papa Flo tactics are working 

Clearly a pen and the ref is calling for the game to continue"
"Pen here and red card for Tchou-Tchou... I guess Real pressure worked, luckily they're so shit this year"
Anyone notice how he didnt even waste a second with giving Vini that offside penalty but doesnt see this obvious one.
Glad to see Olmo still alive after the first half
They are probably not showing this one on RMTV I would wager
ref maybe your son is crying because his dad is a bitch
RM TV got what they wanted
Fuck Madrid. I ain’t even a Barca fan
Clear penalty-Christ.
Var ref did essentially have a gun to his head & probably his family so I understand that he decided to stay shut
"I wouldn't be surprised if apart from all the public bullying, the refs also got some serious threats from people with much higher power and authority."
"New start just dropped, scare the refs."
JUST PUT IT IN THE NET
LOL at the people complaining. Every single match Real Madrid gets away with a lot of shit like this. We Barca fans consider ourselves extremely lucky if the referee is fair. But yeah this one's totally lost it
And they have the audacity to talk about biased refs
Lol ceballos giving it back after the last corner
Because of all the crying
because Cubarsi was the one pulling
"It is. Unfortunately, VAR are held hostage."
Bro nearly took his shirt off lmao. Ref is scared it seems. Sad stuff to see as a Madrid fan.
"At this point, I think madrid paid the ref and then did the RM TV hit to cover it up."
Bullying works after all
"[Not sure, let me see if theres anything it reminds me of](https://youtu.be/ZnzU48vgb1Q?si=_YNxRGp2e9MbxnIX)"
"Is it not DOGSO straight red too? 

Are you seriously telling me he's not scoring when no one pull him.

Jude: 50/50."
"Can't tell shit from the 5 pixels OP posted, hope someone re-upload with a better version and other angles."
in the replay they’re both holding each other
"It is but if you look really closely, you can see he's wearing a white shirt so it's not a pen. 

It should be DOGSO since he's actually stopping cubarsi from scoring"
in the replay they’re both tugging on each other the whole time
Cubarsi starts the pulling mate
"he wants to injure his opponents, le normand got a brain injury bc of him"
"that was text book scissor tackle from the behind, clear red card"
He should be on a red already
Could easily be off by now.
"That cunt wears a white shirt, so he's allowed to do whatever the fuck he wants."
Except for Martin
cry about it
And the Real players have the gall to complain after he doesn't give them a 50/50 for once towards the end. Bloody hell.
"The ref is actually not very competent, Madrid's tirade aside. His decisions have been extremely random. Easy to influence someone if they aren't very good at their job."
Him pulling Cubarsi makes him off balance and prevents Cuba from tapping it in. Clear penalty but I guess those RMtv  videos are working as intended.
"It is a stonewall pen,Even Mcmannaman agreed for fucks sake"
He's scoring if he isn't dragged
"shouldve been. cubarsi clearly gets there if he doesnt get pulled back. altough one could say ""they pulled each other""...

a few questionable decisions going in madrids favour so far, especially cards."
"Real players are all dirty little rats, 0 sportsmanship or care for their opponents while being entitled and smug about it."
Yet he is card free
"Why 2? The handball is not a pen, it's his supporting hand, no way he can tackle with his left arm behind the back"
"first one shouldnt be, natural arm position when you slide, otherwise defenders can never go for a slidetackle without supporting their upper body"
I’d even say this one looks worse. Ceballos half pulled his shirt off here
pulling th strings of the game? what are you on about
Both are holding wach other
It's not. Ceballos was being pulled too
Wow I found one with a brain
Wow a football fan
Guess why he is scared
Have you seen Vasquez speaking with the referee and smiling as soon as the whistle was blown? DEFINITELY some papa perez shit in the background
"Lol, if that's a pen, then what is this?"
That fucking penalty is etched into my brain.
This is legit the first thing that came to my mind lmao
"0:10 look at cubarsi, obv pen"
"At this point  RMTv achieved what they wanted.

Kudos to them one of their most integral investments of real Madrid."
"From our first foul as well. Thanks, RMTV."
Hornets and Madrid fan… pick a struggle
who's crying now
Bitch comment
olmo was on the line
Be objective
How daft are you not to see Cubarsi half naked ?
And he's the one that escaped a card. The victim mentality is comical
"Today is clearly a pen and a red card.

Denial of a clear and obvious goal scoring opportunity

No attempt to play the ball

Textbook"
"but they’re the victims here, haven’t you heard?"
"imagine if they tried to sell 30% of its stake, generational budget lever"
I gotta balance the losing with the winning
front running isn’t cool
your mother and your grandmother
And how daft are you to not see that Cubarsi is also pulling?
"They employ Rudiger lol they should concede one pen every game.

That lad Makes sure he falls on the opponent with his elbow and knees stretched with full force."
Hornets are winning a lot?
Cry about it 😂
"You're beyond repair , hopefully you don't stay this stubborn for the rest of your life . Ceballos is the one impeding him from getting to the ball , Cubarsi is doing what normally happens in the box"
Remember when he was giving Lewis Skelly a nice lil tummy massage with his studs in the last ucl match day.
You clearly got hurt by my comment softie 🤣 crying in my replies
"**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**
  

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
"Captain of Madrid

and vice captain being Vasquez who had his fastest sprint of the day right at halftime to chase down the ref as-well

entitled pricks lol embarrassing."
How can the most successful club in Spain and in Europe act like this?
"I think Real Madrid reached a point when they don't know how to lose. This seasons the team was a classless act all along, with borderline mafia tactics against referees, and bad behaviour all along. So much for the ""señorío"" they like to talk about."
What is wrong with him? He tried to mug Saka at halftime last week. RM need therapy. It is a game and a profession not a fucking war.
 Another week…. Another incident of Carvajal being embarrassing on the sidelines
"I find it absolutely astonishing how Ancelotti is either okay with all this, or just powerless to stop it."
People are going to be analyzing all the angles like the Zapruder film. All time meltdown.
Just a bunch of classless clowns in that club
Camavinga just chilling.
"Very ironic to call them losers, isn't it? But tbh Carvajal is exactly one tier below Pepe and Ramos in terms of acting terribly for me. He tried to break Yamal's legs last season and he always performed the most dangerous tackles post Pepe and Ramos."
He should focus on getting his knee healed instead of being a cry baby
What has changed this season. Why have Real Madrid become completely loathsome?
Bit rude of Carvajal to call his team losers tbh but I’ll take it!
"Yep Barca are the real losers Dani, for sure"
Lmao are they using the non-call on Lamine’s incident as an argument? Kind of them to highlight the fact that they got away with that one. Shameless and delusional.
Need Ribery to come out of retirement to slap him again
"Bitch ass petulant little racist prick of a man 
Ha ha madrid"
Great player but such an angry manlet all the time. He is also sneaky dirty and gets away with a lot of nasty stuff.
Camavinga looking at militao and carvajal like calm down lmao
Imagine psychiatrists and therapists of RM having to handle these animlas every day
man fuck Real
"""bunch of losers!"" - guy who lost

This consecutive humbling of these petulant cunts has been truly satisfying I cant lie."
"Ancelloti is soft with his players. All well and good when they’re disciplined, but when they’re not he doesn’t have the balls to have the hard conversations."
Someone really needs to do something about this team. I can’t believe the behavior they get away with. It’s disgusting.
"A Vox fan acting like a literal d*ckhead, how surprising..."
Get fucked you crybaby bitch
"Carvajal has always thrown his toys out the pram when it doesn't go his way, disgrace of a footballer, shame he's won so much otherwise he'd have no credibility in the game"
Cunt on the pitch and cunt out of it
Perfect player to represent the current state of this club. Couldn’t have a better captain.
I love how calm Camavinga here lol
Real MadDiva
Do madrid fans condemn it or is it excused or even worse glorified by them? I would be dissing my club if this is how players behaved on a regular basis
"Hey don’t insult your 12th man like that, he’s your teammate."
"Spanish insults are hilarious

caradura (hardface) tf"
REMONTADAAAAAAA
Least embarrassing Madrid player
Tin Foil Hat FC
Suspend him till the end of the season
Real Madrid really did a number this weekend huh …. Hope for the first time the face consequences
This guy should not be allowed on the sidelines.
"Real need a man manager that can rein in the squad because now it’s just a compounding problem that Ancelotti seems entirely powerless and/or spineless to do anything about. It’s a talented group of players that are obviously capable of winning but for the first time in like a decade, Madrid look entirely mentally fragile and look rattled on a fundamental level."
"When he said bunch of losers, I think he was referring to his club. He may have squinty eyes that he was watching his players while it may seem he is seeing the ref. /Sssss"
Camavinga is ashamed of this bunch
"I enjoyed it when Carvajal hurt his knee and was crying like a little child. Such a faux tough guy lol.

I tore my acl when I was 18 and didn’t make a sound. It hurt like hell, but I certainly didn’t roll around crying like I needed my mom.

What a loser lol."
Short queen complex
"Yet more evidence of ""both sides"" losing it during the game u/sensitiveCube"
The commentor at the end is saying you could said those things but cover your mouth
"Going from superstars like Benzema, kroos, Bale, Ronaldo, Modric ( still a good guy at least) Marcelo  to these guys is just insane. Like I’m sure the other guys had egos but I don’t remember them behaving like this"
Can’t think of a more obnoxious and unlikeable group of players in recent memory
Carvajal is nothing more than a little bitch himself
"This team will never win anything with this mentality. Maybe they think this is passion, but that's laughable, this is something else.

Instead of reprimanding the players for the crappy things they said and done in the last couple of years, the whole team lowered itsetlf to that shitty level, management included.

Where is humility, fair play, sportmanship, etc? Things need to change and this kind of change has to come from the top."
I just find it strange that Movistar and others never have cameras focused on non-Madrid players. Raphinha has proven to have a temper. Yet the only videos we see are from the stands. No 4K HD cameras with subtitles attached.
Barca guys acted like they are so classy they don’t do such things. Last season we all remember.
Man in stands yells at referee. Y’all need to calm down
and some people think he should had won the ballon dor because he tagged along to two winning teams
"Forget about what has happened historically, how do they watch just this match and think the ref was against them?"
"They have managed to convince themselves they are victims of a massive conspiracy to stop them winning.

A little bit of 'the world is against us' can be good for a team, it can make them work harder and be a massive boon for team morale.

RM have gone way too hard into it though and have started to really lose it."
"Dont need to look past the coach. As rudiger, vini, vazquez, bellingham are losing their shit and trying to earn rest of season suspensions, ancelotti is steps away from them just looking at his feet. 
  
Take a bunch of highly entitled players who havent been shown any discipline in years and whose management treats the club like a bunch of infallible angels and you get this shit. Doesnt help that vini and bellingham are generational talents at bitching at the ref. Refs never keeping them in check leads to this too."
they didn’t become successful from sportsmanship
"That's what spoiled brat always do. 

Acting like this when something against their way and keep their mouths shut when everything happened as they want to happen even when there is something wrong about it."
Entitlement. They believe they have the right to act like this because they're the best. They should always win and it's never their fault they don't. They act like there's a massive conspiracy against them because its the only reason they believe they can lose.
Their success has an asterisk next to it
"They got success with the refs favouring them. Now, they're barking when refs are trying to do the best of their job."
TBF this is average enthusiastic fan behaviour in a stadium. But this is Carvajal so I’ll still appreciate any hating of this man.
This is in the club's DNA
Probably don't have enough serious and vocal leaders like Ramos to just call them out on this shit anymore if at all.
Is the most succesful club in Spain because they let them do this and more. Refs were alwas cherrypicked and helped them. Now everything is a conspiracy against them. It's insane and disgusting.
"I feel theyve been having this attitude as long as I remember last 25 years, maybe its a bit worst now.

They always get the calls also lol"
how do you think they are the most sucessful? it's not because of their football
"There seems to be a global trend of the most powerful, most successful entities who have shaped the arenas they’re in thinking they’ve been the victims of it all along"
Entitlement.
Madrid are used to having referees on their side in pursuit of trophies.
*The most successful in the world.
Absolutely ridiculous that the club where many all time greats played fell this far. No kid in Spain will supoort them for the foreseeable future.
So they should stay silent when the ref cheats?
"2 things can be correct: 1) they can be absolute pricks. 2) But they can also be targeted by the media. Have you seen these videos on Raphinha, Lamine, Gavi, De Paul, or others?"
Señorío is a distant memory. Mourinho killed it.
"I don't know what it is, but they lost all calmness that used to be there but still claim a ""winning mentality"" for themselves. I do not see how this team goes anywhere without some major changes and a manager willing to rip their heads off.


At this point I'm no longer opposed to letting Vini leave and show Rüdiger the door. Ramos at least knew how to play dirty and not lose his head"
">What is wrong with him?

Nothing. This is simply par for the course for Carvajal."
"Yep this is average Carvajal behavior, I'm actually shocked he didn't run onto the field to shout directly in the referee's face"
"Bet he was trying to get Saka to react and get sent off, while his own team isn’t impacted as much even if he was punished."
Entire team is unhinged lol
Arsenal not a war
">It is a game and a profession not a fucking war.

That mentality is why Carvajal is one of the most decorated fullbacks in the history of the sport...

You don't win that much thinking it's just a job and losing doesn't mean much lol"
He is also embarrassing on the pitch as well
"He knows what his players are like and he thinks it’s not his job to change them…

What happened today was absolutely not ok and as the manager he needs to control his players"
Madrid need a Manager willing to murder half this squad instead of enabling it. He and 2-3 of the affected players should leave
He even looks embarassed
Always has been
"They’ve been like this, you guys are just now seeing it"
Last season they were winning. This side comes out whenever shit doesn't go their way
"They are always like this. People just started paying attention to their shitty behaviour.

The moment people started to see them for what they are is the no show on ballon d'or ceremony"
This is nothing new. People always just turned a blind eye
Make Real Great Again
Losing repeatedly to rival club full of teenagers
"> three clear pens denied

> refereeing was all good

Lmao"
Hahah do people actually believe that!?
"“tagged along to two winning teams”

He had his second best ever season with Madrid and scored 6 and assisted 6, as a defender. Also, scored in the UCL final to give Madrid the lead. 

He was Spain’s starting right back. I don’t think he had a legit claim to the ballon d’or but to say he “tagged along” is a bit disingenuous."
Username checks out
Reality doesn't matter it's just what they want it to be
"You can’t separate the two, they think the way they think precisely because of all the history behind of having referees deciding matches on their favour. It just makes them whiny and entitled no matter what. Just a note: RM would have 10 CL less if VAR existed (and was correctly applied) during all the CL they won, source: IFFHS."
They are like toddlers who are enabled by their parents to behave badly.
This sent me lmfao
Even when they are.
"To the privileged, equality feels like oppression. 

And it’s not even that it was equal either, the calls/non-calls were fairly in their favour."
Kids find gangsters cool let alon hotheaded players. As long as they can win that wont ever be an isdue
"Yeah, specially because he cheated in Madrid favor"
"Yeah, I never seen him as someone that has any class.
But I could name a few more playing in his team."
"Could’ve added a couple people to “people he’s choked on the pitch” list, really missed opportunity :("
"Maybe he can’t run yet, how far into his rehab is he?"
Bro is *not* MSD
Would fit in well with the rest of the barbarians at atleti
And that is unprofessional from a player out of the squad in the stands.
You’re such a loser
"Oh silly me, I must have forgotten about the time when Maldini and Pirlo ran on to the pitch and threw items at the referee claiming corruption, or when Ronaldinho used to shout obscenities at the referees every minute he was on the pitch"
tHe mEnTaLitY
"I don't recall Messi running down and screaming at the ref every time Barca lost. 

Guess he just doesn't have the mentality to be a top player like Carvajal."
"“Refereeing was all good….


…for us!”"
Yeah saw plenty of shouts for him to win it.
go back to any thread that had such discussions and you will see
I still think they'll find Yamal more appealing than Vinicius.
Dont even try. They'll tell you carvajal has more cl than those guys
"It’s really funny how the club has single handedly managed to change the narrative around them. 

I have barely any stake or interest in La Liga. But since the Chelsea-barca game 15 years ago, I had a terrible bias against Barca, and I generally enjoyed the magical CL run Real Madrid used to have for over a decade. 

The last 2 years have had me forget all about the past and have made me a supporter of any club that defeats Real Madrid. I now appreciate the way Barca is run 100x more than that pathetic excuse of a club. Crying foul over racism while doing antics worthy of jail time in other professions, bullying Refs into submission and the general entitlement that when even a minuscule thing goes against them, no matter how fair, to lay on the floor and whine like little bitches, this is a shadow of the club I used to know as Real Madrid. My local team might not have any UCLs in their cabinet, but they sure do have more self respect than them."

Football twitter has cooked my brain because my first thought after that goal was “now that “had Mbappe scored a free kick” account has to deactivate”
Worst Wall ever
What's that twitter account going to do now?
"I'm legitimately sad, that was my favourite football gimmick..."
Reminder that he wouldn’t be playing today if he got more than one game ban for a potential career ending tackle
i never thought that the day that bappe would score a free kick would arrive
r/soccer crying
Game's gone for that account
Good thing the free kick was in the middle. Those corners are gone
Seems like that’s where Szczesny should have been standing….
"the first thought in my head was ""that twitter account has lost its gimmick"""
"What a time to score your first direct free kick goal

That Mbappe free kick account is in shambles"
That wall was awful lol
Nothing is impossible-- Mbappe
The fuck is that wall?! And where is tek standing?!
Mbappe is a beast to beat in finals no doubt
Was literally talking shit why give it to mbappe he never scores from free kicks
"I was literally saying to myself ""Why is he standing over it like he's gonna score a free kick"" lol"
"I'm happy for him, he finally scored a free kick"
TWITTER ACCOUNT RETIRED.
What on earth was that wall? It's just a big gap.
Learned from Declan Rice
"Why is this entire thread talking about some twitter account and not the goal lol.   

Great free kick. You can blame the keeper for these ones normally but it's absolutely drilled against the inside of the base of the post."
"10/10 FK

1/10 slide"
He finally did it
essentially a pen
RETIRED THE TWITTER MBAPPE FK ACCOUNT!!!
Pedri has been fucking around way way too much in the midfield was bound to happen
Frenkie whyyy
That account will have to put the fries in the bag
"De jong is lucky he got away with a yellow card, could had been red carded."
Turtle time

This is his second free kick goal.
First free kick ever 1-0 down in a final when he's out of form.
Always the ones that should be banned
Has Mbappé scored a free-kick?
"Can we have a moment of silence for that No Freekick account? Rest in Peace, my friend."
That twitters's acc 9/11
W shit exciting game
 Horrid knee slide but a great way to equalise
man he actually scored a direct FK lmaooooo the meme is actually dead this time
"Mbappé FK Twitter's account VAR Check : His FK hit the post before going in the net, thus the account will still run /s"
What a goal 🤙🏼
Yet people still call him the problem
playing withoiut a GK will ruin barça season. Its literally like that.
That twitter account must be fuming at the big pole lol.
Rice sends his regards
Damn before his attempt I was like „why Mbappe?“ bro proved me wrong😂
That reaction by Vinicius.
No way! It's like his first official free kick goal ever no?
No technicality this time that’s officially a free kick goal for the turtle lesgooo!!
Also in a just world he shouldn't be playing this game but here we are.
Would have been wild is Mbappe celebrated by taking off his shirt and torching it
That slide was almost as bad as Shedeur's.
Has Mbappé won an UCL gimmick starts right now
A self proclaimed Barca fan account on Twitter shutting down due to a Mbappe Freekick against his own team. You can't make this shit up.
Commentators saying it was poor keeping but I disagree
Why are we letting through AI videos
He's almost killed himself celebrating it bruh
That guy on twitter must be fuming
LETS FUCKING GOOOO
Raphinia is wastefull. Mbappe is not. And I want Barca to win...
Madrid is playing with Barca like they are a bunch on teenagers.
"Sorry but this game is being influenced by the referee. Countless yellows not give, a penalty not given to Barca 

Harassing the ref works"
Just in the last couple of weeks Declan Rice and now Mbappe have scored the first FKs of their careers. Now it's Haaland's turn
That slide made me cringe because he's already injured
"Corrupted club got a goal, they should have 5 red cards already"
Congrats to real. Another ref bought.
"Best day of his life actually 

Gonna get so much engagement when he posts his next hatetweet (literally 40k likes in the first minute so far)

All his hard work boutta pay off rn"
It was a beautiful journey
What's that twitter account called? I forgot it
This time it's real
"His tweet after Mbappe scored the free kick has over 90,000 likes lmao"
End of an era
50k likes in the first minute on his post lmao you were not the only one to think of that guy
"In fairness if he was ever going to score directly from a free kick, doing it against Barcelona in a Copa Del Rey final can't get much better than that"
Rebrand to Has Mbappe Won a UCL
"Don't be sad it ended, be happy it happened!"
Lmaooo bro take a peep. Shambles all around.
Bro he already deleted the account
"Literally just seen his tweet about leaving the
Platform and immediately had to come find the goal 💀"
It was fun while it lasted
Can’t wait for them to say it’s not direct because it hit the bar
The Squirtle is inevitable
Looked like a penalty lmao
"Pathetic wall though, what kind of stupid 4D chess did they think they were doing?"
His reaction had 35k likes in 51 seconds holy hell
His tweet hit big immediately. That's crazy lmao
He started a Spaces chat called “The End”. This guys a comedy genius.
Fraud checked.
\-1000 aura for knee slide fail
Yeah but to be fair the field is shit tonight.
He reemerge from his ashes
Hattrick of free kicks imminent
Against Barcelona... What a goal
"""from a free kick"" it's his 2nd goal, but 1st directly from a free kick.   
Edit: No, he's taken other free kicks. Just his first goal. Also, [some people don't have a sense of humour.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM0ILL7wuxA)"
Thought his ankle was gone again
Bale / Robben reminiscent
Spent all his aura on the freekick
His post has reached 100k likes in less than 3 mins
Gonna say something like “too close more of a pen” or something I can already see it lmao
The ban only applies to La liga Games anyway
I hate both tbh lol but I love Mbappe so this is good for me
Most of us hate Barcelona and Real Madrid tbh
And madrid fans wonder why they're hated. Victim complex is just in madrids culture ig
Same bruuuuh😂😂😂
na mbappe was in on goal. frenkie had to do it.
Tbh I think mbappe had a better chance scoring if he ran off than a free kick
"There was another defender right in front of Mbappe,  he wasn't lucky."
Why would it be a red? Wasn't last man.
Cubarsi was ahead tbh.
"textbook red that is, honestly"
Barca dominated them outside of a bad 25 minutes in the second half
Embarrassing coming from an Inter fan
"You are seething with rage friend, have a beer and calm down."
1.7m views he’s absolutely farming

100k in 4 mins is mad
Could really hit records man
The grass is whack tbf
I legit got worried lol
Gravesinha.
Nah they admitted it.
Not what's been shown as of late
What is bro talking about 💔
"He was in on goal, very clear goal scoring opportunity. You don't need to be last man to get a red"
"The rule isn't last man, its Denial of a goal scoring opportunity. Mbappe was in the process of shooting when the foul happened. I don't think a red would be given that often for this, but it is possible."
"Rule is goal scoring opportunity, not last man"
that was a clear goal scoring opportunity lmao it's typically a red but the ref doesn't want this el classico to go off rails
how much is he likely to earn for thay
"Respect for him, lad just kept going and while it may seem easy work it actually can be draining af.

If he's smart he'll just rebrand / go with another account something like: HasKM7WonTheCL? or other things that are ""rare"". I mean if he wants another long run he should just go with: ""HasRMnotblamedanyoneafterthegame"""
"People probably flocking to the account, the fact it happened in El Classico in the final when the whole world is already watching"
Woah woah spoiler
"Just found it lol. Just googled "" mbappe has not scored a fk "" and it popped up"
Like fr. It was funny asf. Always something new
about 400k in 2 hrs lmao
And whose fault is that?
Atleast one dollar

Looks almost comical
Incredible how 7 defenders arrive before any attacker gets on screen
"Looks like kids in the car park all chasing the ball 

No rules football"
"You can stay up in the PL scoring one goal a season as long as you don’t concede any. 

*tapping head meme* "
I'd fear for my life if I was that attacker lol
I'm surprised they didn't all just rough him up once they arrived.
Never seen anything like it
Looks like they foul the striker running up in support at 2 secs
Reminds me of the clip of Bielsa’s Leeds in the championship
"You've seen total football, now we got total defence"
Would have been hilarious if he just weaved his way through them and scored
This reminds me of the those old Dutch National team games maybe in the 60’s? They seem to just swarm like bees.
[This is what it reminds me of](https://youtube.com/shorts/hZsOF1vBAyI?si=AWzb4Zh8zdGcMfDs).
So if Burnley get relegated next year are we saying that Scott Parker is to be the next Bayern manager?
Best defence in europe is a stretch LMAOO
This will be the imminent new trend in football
it’s like those clips where a spider chases an ant into an anthill and then the ants chase the spider out
It was a foul on the 2nd attacker running forward but damn then the clip looks really impressive
"""FUCKING GET 'IM!!!"""
PED defence
They're flocking

Best defence in Europe's second tier."
This is proper Leeds hound ball

"""Best defense in Europe"" 😂 let's cool it on the pre workout. Maybe they can get top 10 in the EPL next year!"
"I won't call if best defense. Its the league itself. 

Let's see how they perform in PL."
Is Scott Parker a good coach or not?? Because that’s so impressive. Commitment to the cause

"all jokes aside, conceding only 15 goals in 45 games is fucking insane, 

Championship Scott Parker is a force to be reckoned with."
"They should do well in the Premier League. Promoted teams often try to be clever to play attacking football (see Southampton), but more often a well drilled defensive sides get just enough draws and a few wins here and there to avoid relegation. "
Heading to Turf Moor is going to be hell next season.
I mean 5 players on 1 player means 4 others have no defender.
"Mate, are you the Burnley hater with their flair?"
Ugh Burnley again. At least a promoted team with a defensive mentality would be a nice change finally
"Lets see how that "" best defence in Europe"" does against Premier league attackers."
best in Europe looloolooll. We'll see next season
"Let's see if this ""best defense in europe"" holds up next season for them not to get relegated again :)"
I already can't wait for them to be relegated tf is ts

Reminds me of the Johan cruyff with the Netherlands pressing

They run in there like a herd of toddlers with no positional discipline
"Holy shit, they hauled ass!"

Shades of that one Atleti clip.
Utter woke excellence
They’re gonna terrorize Premier League.
Or QPR/Reading (can't tell because of the grainy video) have the worst counterattack.
Klopp vibes.
My highschool coach would scream shape and it would mean get the fuck back and defend
La naranja mecánica.
maybe one of the refs should have seen that shirt pull
Are we sure they're only using 11 players? Felt like i saw 30 different Burnley players.
Avengers Assemble
This is the anti Real Madrid
I know it's repeated every time a championship team gets promoted with a slightly unusual tactic (Hughton's overlapping CBs come to mind) but will this really work in the PL when they're getting battered every week? Running is a lot easier when you're winning and everyone is loving life.
"You might have seen Jose, Conte, TT and Arteta’s haram ball. This housewives favourite wanker’s haram ball is next level. 

Fuck you Parker, what were you doing in the Brugge game against Benfica?"

Watch them get ripped apart in prem when you have players like salah and saka running at them instead

The avengers showed up. That’s amazing defensive transition
This is why these teams go back down right away
"In a years time, welcome Burnley back to Championship! 

There's always a sweetheart club for PL fans each year that always fail everyones expectations.

Congrats to Burnley, hopefully they manage to stay in top division."
You ever seen the videos of the defenders chasing a guy who’s scored an unsportsmanlike goal? Yeah this gives the same vibes.
We’ll see how they get on next year
"Look to the right of the ref. Defender pulls down attacker. Now the only attacker has to go 1v1, which gives time for defenders to track back. 

Not disregarding the effort to get back, but could have been a different outcome 2v1."
If they had the best defense in Europe they would still be in the FA cup.
That's the real Burnley right there !! Not your tiki taka shit like Kompany tried
English Football 🤡
"yep, they run , wow"
Kompany was holding them back so much last year
Why does an unknown team warrant 3.5k upvotes?
The attacker still got his cross into the box.
Change the music and it’s either a comedy or a horror movie.
"From the attacker’s perspective, it’s terrifying. “I’ve got a 1v1 with time and space. I’ll just set the defender up for a cut inside and…oh fuck! Where the hell did they all come from??”"
Reminds me of that video from Japan of 3 pros vs 100 children.
I actually laughed when I saw it lol
I actually laughed.
One of my niche favourite things in football are these clips. I remember one from like 22/23 Arsenal that was the same. Love it
"tbf, one attacker gets hauled down on the halfway line"
there was a 2nd who got fouled
Shows how little effort most of our attacking players put in today. Disgusting lack of respect for our support through another season of mediocrity
Scott Parker has drilled this side well. I am looking forward to next year. I think Leeds and Burnley can do something.
Cue the avengers music and 7 players shouting 'on your left'
Mmm. Marvellous.
38 points is enough most seasons. The last time a team got relegated with more (39) was in 2011

This genuinely looks exactly like total football from Rinus Michels' Dutch team. Full pressure on the guy with the ball.

70s but yes your point stands
nah real madrid probaly
He's not a Pep disciple so no top club for him. Only Kompany and Maresca can get away with that.
Needs to speak fluent German
'if'. They're definitely getting relegated.
"I mean obviously you have to take into account the level. We would of course be battered by top league teams, but statistically we are the best defensive team the 2nd division has ever seen (by quite some margin), have 30 clean sheets and are currently tied with Mourinho's Chelsea for least goals conceded in a season.

A bit of hyperbole never hurt anyone, and we are phenomenal this season"
"Doubt it, better teams will just keep the ball and it's not like pressing like mad hasn't been done before"
Till all their hamstrings go ka-blamo as soon as they get european games
When they’re bottom and taking backshots from Haaland and Marmoush they can sing best defense in Europe 🥀😔
"Yes it is, he's been on loan to us this season (QPR)"
Well ofc a team in the championship cant have the best defence in the world but i think the title is just a burnley fan being proud of his team and going overboard without giving it much thought
"While true, the previous goals conceded record was 30.

In fact, if we didn't exist Leeds could have broken the record this season and we have conceded 14 less goals.

The Championship is a lesser league but we have done something completely unprecedented that Newcastle, Villa and other assortment of clubs too big for the league couldn't do"
"It is, on paper, the best defense in all European leagues at present. 32 games in a row unbeaten, only lost 2 games all season, and only conceded 15 goals in 45 games.

What would you call it?"
"He's always seemed at the very least decent at coaching defences. But his teams have struggled to score.

This seems to have changed this season. So it will be interesting to see if he makes it work in the Prem this time around."
"Slaaaaaaaves!

You're the second person in 14 years to mention it. 😂"
"The Burnley video has the benefit of a winning season, and everyone loving their job. Get relegated in April and you'll not see this type of running again."
Where's the pass then coach?
Kompany ball lover spotted ig
Flair checks out.
You might wanna check that again... 😂
"Probably a lot less well, but doesn't mean we can't enjoy the now!"
"Tbf there have been significant portions of this season where this team absolutely hasn't been loving life. Parker has done a top job to make this unit click.

We won our first two games by a total 9-1. We were a free-flowing attacking team and then we had a complete fire sale and sold half the squad. People who didn't leave were miserable (effectively we had a full squad of Kompany disciples who didn't give a shit about the badge) and in general morale was low. We immediately lost to Sunderland and everything looked scary.

Parker completely scrapped what he did to start the league and focused on building the squad from the back. Which worked great to stop the bleed and built some morale but we went on that HORRIFIC run of 0-0 draws with occasional 1-0 wins. The team didn't know how to hit the net and the fans were groaning every game.

The last few months since the Leeds game (genuine contender for worst televised football match of all time) we have pushed on and really become this super motivated team.

The lads have run through the misery, the backline have been as consistent as a ticking clock, and the lads rallied behind the gaffer.

I don't think this squad will give up on Parker immediately because of a pumping from Arsenal next season (unless Parker gives up on them like he did Bournemouth I guess)"
"Users most active communities: Premiere League

"Even then, the camera pans across midfield and shows a mix of 3-4 players from each team, and suddenly the transition. One attacking player falls at the half way, but there's a full 10 players back in position before there's an ounce of support, 3 players in a muddle"
"It is pretty funny that the post promoting the Burnley defence, they get away with a blatant foul that completely changes the outcome of the attack. The tracking back in amazing effort, but in this situation it barely matters since you have already fouled the only attacker who's run actually did beat you"

lol the ref completely missed that too.
"Fuck it, no ball"
Even that’s a good tactical foul ffs 
"Also, i'm not sure, but at second 7, the number 8 looks like he grabbed the striker on the flank and slowed him down after failing to tackle.

In extreme cases an intentional foul or card is justified and can save a goal, but still a dirty conduct for me. The striker made a poor decision to dodge it and not receive a foul."
"Late night, lamposts, little Timmy scrapes his knee, ouch. Oof"
You should get a points deduction if you managed 37 0-0 matches
"That great final day battle between wolves, Birmingham, Wigan and a couple others. It's a shame we haven't seen something like that in years."
Who was it?
"One goal scored and none conceded should be good for 40 points, which is nearly always sufficient."
I’m looking forward to being at least average again for the first time in years. Also if attendance even remotely holds up I think the club will be continuing their upward trajectory in the things that matter for the long term.

A bit of hyperbole is probably the worst crime you can commit on a football sub.
Weren't you the best offensive team the 2nd division had ever seen the last time you got promoted like two years ago? Best might be hyperbolic.
"Haha I'm sure it is on paper but they're playing championship sides...up 3-0. Let's wait till they're in a top league, playing against top teams to make outrageous claims. Or do you disagree? Bc if you do then my nephews u-12 team is the best defense in the world, they haven't given up a goal all season 😂"
"It can only be the best in championship, you can't compare stats from 2nd division with top flight and call it ""the best in Europe"""
Glad someone gets it!
If Leeds keep two clean sheets and finish their game before Burnley on the final day then Leeds will hold the record for about a minute or two before Burnley snatch it off them.
"It’s the best defensive record, that does not make it the best defence."
"> It is, on paper, the best defense in all European leagues at present.

No, it isn't.

If we ignore the level of competition, then why not ignore it entirely? Then Differdange is currently leading the Luxembourg 1st tier with 5 conceded in 25 (also they are yet to concede in 2025), a much better rate than even yours."
"He will get battered first game and blame his players saying they aren’t PL quality, they need to sign new 11, proceed to get sacked, and the new manager will get a tune out of said “non-PL” players."
"> But his teams have struggled to score.

I wouldn't have said that that was particularly true if you look at his Championship record, which is most of his career so far. Burnley's defence this season has been amazing, but they've also outscored everyone except for Leeds and, bizarrely, 13th-placed Norwich. Similarly, his promoted Bournemouth team outscored everyone except for Fulham. Arguably true of his promoted Fulham team, who were only the 7th-top scorers that season, but even that isn't really what I'd call ""struggling to score"".

His Premier League record isn't great, but it basically amounts to a single full season in charge of a strong favourite for relegation (Fulham) plus four games with Bournemouth. Bit meaningless, so I'd tend to reserve judgement until we have more to go on."

Why does spotify tell me Verdansk by Dave matches the lyrics
"Yeah, I agree - that's the reason they didn't concede in this situation. The attacking player in the middle has got ahead of the defender and seems to have the beating of him for pace. All the guy in possession has to do is put the ball into a 20 square yard space and his teammate is through on goal. The guys sprinting back, while admirable, would be irrelevant."
"> they get away with a blatant foul that completely changes the outcome of the attack

That's good defending though"
">promoting the Burnley defence...fouled the only attacker who's run actually did beat you

I don't watch Burnley, but is that part of the reason the defence is good? A bit of dark art element where they don't foul ball carriers but second or third players in support since they might be behind the refs line of vision?"
Feels like the post is spot on.  It shows the crazy hustle plus the dark arts.
He booked him after
That hurt :(

Wasn't funny though
Do you always turn into a bell-end when jokes don't land?
Best defensive team the 2nd division has ever seen can't be hyperbolic when we have conceded 15 less goals than the all time record and have tied the all time clean sheets record?
"Well he's been injured for half the season haha but before that he was very dynamic and very entertaining. An entertaining playmaker in the make of days gone. I'm not quite sure how I'd rate him after injury, I've felt a bit of melancholy about the team lately and the team as a whole has been inconsistent these last few months."
u/daretozamora what's your take on dembele this season? When he's not been injured that is
"I agree, but at the same time the Championship is probably like the 7th best league in Europe. "
Semantics innit.
They've just reformed to celebrate the anniversary of The Mechanical Hand btw
"Haha not sure about that. But I first heard Black Star on a World War 1 video showcasing soldiers suffering from PTSD or shellshock and it was sad and eerie as hell. https://youtu.be/TieL5YDB9U4?si=GlNciZCZXEHoA1HL

Then I heard it again on a video of a train driving down a train track https://youtu.be/IlPh_0V_uqc?si=Td-m90YSw4zx-FyI

I also had the worst nightmare I have ever had after listening to this song. As in, I listened to the song and then had the nightmare. Quite trippy. If you faced Cthulhu, this would be the song you would hear lol."
"In the championship maybe. But in the prem it’s just bookings galore and asking to be relegated again.

Most teams come straight back down because their play style needs to be overhauled to adapt to the prem and they don’t have the time to do it"
Isn't that what every team does? People acting like bringing down a runner during a counterattack is unusual.
"We have ABSOLUTELY mastered some dark arts with this team. Trafford has become a prime instigator (look at how he fucked with Sunderland's psyche when he saved two pens), Hannibal driving teams mad every game, Flemming winds up defenders all game, and Cullen absolutely has a bit of Championship Rodri about him.

But also Esteve is genuinely a top level CB, Egan-Riley has been top class and Traffords save statistics are absurd to go along with the shithousing. There is some incredible defending coupled with Prime Dyche shithousery and dark arts"
That last line had definitely put you on a list… somewhere.
Bordalas (61) to be next Burnley manager confirmed
"Yeah I was surprised to be fair, kept thinking of that Trossard(?) video this season where he does it to 2 different players in the same attack and nothing happens"
I was referring to my own comment calling you best offensive
"Well I can say I’m excited to watch him next year. I think it’s fair to say he’s been on and off this year, but when he’s been on he’s been great to watch. Better luck with injuries, a good preseason and a couple lbs of muscle and he can be a great player for us"
"No not really, they’re two very different things."
Not really. Similarly how a player can have the best defensive stats without being the best defender in the world.
"I collect CDs that I find in the wild (I don't allow myself to ""cheat"" and buy online). I used to have The Mechanical Hand but it got stolen. I still have A Natural Death."
Rodri has 4 titles mate
"Love to hear it. Love that shit. Looking forward to seeing city, Liverpool, Arsenal etc fans pulling their hair out next season."
I unironically love watching Getafe lmfao
"Oh, I don't actually remember tbh. I don't think we broke any goal scoring records though, we got close to the points record but our lads basically were on holiday for most of the run in so we fell short (meant we won the league at Blackburn though, so worth it)"
"Solid take, I don't know if it was just me but early in the season I thought he was going to overtake chair to become our best attacker. We'll see how things go next season and if we even manage to keep marti."
Any measure other than on paper is surely just subjective?
"Don't understand the question, Maxime Esteve is obviously the best CB in the world?"
There’s nothing relevant about that statement
Do you think your play style will translate to the premier league this time? I still remember Kompany going to Man city on opening day and playing out from the back. So brave.
"Yeah sure, and we can also say that Celtic have the best attack in the world. But I know, you know, and everyone else knows, that it isn’t true."
"So, using this logic, if a sunday league team only concedes 5 goals all season, they are the best defence in the world, right?"
He consistently commits tactical fouls at the halfway line to stop promising attacks before they fully develop
"I think this has significantly more chance for sure. This is more like when Dyche brought us up playing solid football that focuses on being secure and grinding out positive results.

That being said I believe Dyche (at least the Dyche of 2015) is significantly more versatile as a manager.

It will be tough, but it can't be worse than Kompany's way"
Yeah obviously
"So did hendo too when he was at Liverpool but neither of them rarely (if ever) did something as blatant as this. Usually in the opposition half and don’t let their man turn or get into full stride.

This attack is pretty far developed, out in the open with one pass left to play. I’m not gonna say var would definitely intervene (they’re daft) but it’s clear they should. And if they didn’t at first, you’d get away with things this blatant for 5-8 games max"
"This is a yellow card offence so far out, VAR would never intervene and shouldn't

Did what he had to do, made the tactical foul, 100% right decision"
"**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**

They should add this to their post match ref documentary
I feel so bad for this ref
The refs kids love to see another day.
Lol people in this thread comment on the wrong penalty shout. Rüdiger literally clipped his feet which made him lose balance. Clear pen
Raphina one is understandable but Ferran one was clear penalty. Fuck RM crying all week
Is it weird that I think that both Asensio does the foul and Raphinha starts diving before even the contact ? edit : sorry I thought this was the replay of the Raphinha call
bullying works
I guess crying all week works. Absolutely insane how 2 clear penalties weren't awarded.
"thats a pen imo

edit: welp they got one anyways lol

edit2: nevermind"
Am I crazy - that last angle looked like a dive
That's two now
It’s both a penalty and a dive lmao
Its a pen if it happened to madrid
Imagine the pressure on the ref having to decide this.
Third time ref is trash
swiped his leg from under him..
Pen all day
Real Madrid’s ref pressuring tactic worked
How is that not a penalty?
Penalty for Barcelona (IMO)
are my eyes deceiving me or does it seem there was no contact
Should have been a peno
"It is a pen, nothing else to it"
"If that’s a pen, we would have a penalty every 10 mins every game lol"
Madrid's tactics worked
Who tf is the VAR official.
Torres was a stone cold penalty bruh
"Have mixed feeling for the ref. I feel pity that he was put in an impossible position before the game, and the pens he should have called, he didn't, and the one he shouldn't have, he did. Tbf I also though it was a pen in real time.

VAR though, I feel no pity for them. They've been shocking to not have the ref review the previous 2 calls with Ferran and Cubarsi"
RMTV works and the kids on school who bullied the referee's son were right. LMAO.
Wasn't Torres fouled?
Really feel sorry for the ref. Feels like a high school match with rowdies on both sides who will see you after the match. His crying before the match didn't help either.
"All these comments talking about the other scene are funny af, you guys are crazy"
"Absolute nailed on pen, impossible to know the laws of the game and defend this decision."
Definitely sweeps the leg
Are you people blind or can't bother to check what action has been posted here? It's not the overturned penalty. But rather the Ferran's which was a stonewall penalty not even considered
i couldn't believe he didn't give us the pen and didn't even check var
Omg omg omg omg
"Thi reff really afraid to give Barcelona penalty

Few others clear foul and he still hesitant until this"
That's not a penalty in any universe but Madrid are the villains tonight
Two times the charm
"Clear penalty. Talk now, dipshits.

Also...now it's a penalty :)

Edit: Yikes. Real Madrid is so fucking helped game after game lol how can these idiots talk"
This is clearly a Pen. How VAR didn't say anything was crazy
Watch it at regular speed. It is impossible to fall like that without contact. Everyone who’s played football at medium amateur level will tell you it’s a 100% penal.
Thats a fucking pen
That’s a dive
Yeah that's a pen
so fucking rigged. 3 PENS
People saying that’s a pen?? Did they watch the replay???
Clear penalty
Straight up pen there.
2 robbed pens and a clear red they avoided by bullying the ref. The tactic worked
that's a fucking pen and they want to cry about the ref
"People wondering why madrid stoop so low to intimidate refs, I hope now they understand. They do it because it works. Ref has been scared to call fouls in Barcelona's favour the whole match, did not give at least 3-4 clear yellows, and now this is the 2nd good ppenalty shout that wasn't given."
LMAO DOESNT EVEN TOUCH HIM
I hate Madrid with all my heart but it’s not a penalty
Very soft but it’s a pen tbh
"At least they called another pen right away, because this was a clear one too.

EDIT: nvm, I agree that one was nothing at all whatsoever, but... yeah, Barça should have gotten this one in first place, sigh."
Lmao that's the right decision
lol. I genuinely can’t believe rm have the audacity to suggest they get the worst calls lol
We’ll never hear the end of this 😭😭
No fucking wayyy
not negreira...
didn’t expect that
"Dudes kid is gonna be bullied again but this time the Barca fans, cruel world we live in"
"It's all very weird. The referee still ended up being the focus of the game, even setup to be the star in the final minute of normal time."
the pressure worked because the ref was horrible OMG
"This is fucking crazy man, after all the talk in the week"
"I don't really understand, that's a foul he hooks his calf, soft maybe but if that's given it's probably not overturned. 

Feels like that's maybe an 80/20 call in favour of a pen, but because it's stoppage time in a drawn final is the main reason they don't give it."
"Everyone shouting a dive, watch the clip from the start, take a deep breath, and realise that this is the Ferran clip"
I'm not a fan of either team but can someone explain how that's not a pen? Clearly clips his foot
Ref woke up yesterday with a horse's head in the sheets
Dude was falling over 3 seconds before Rudiger moves. But I guess this subreddit just loves hating this one team
He should learn to stay on his feet
"After checking it again, it is a penalty, but the angle shown here is not the best to check how Rudiger applies enough force so that Ferran loses the balance. I've seen another angle where it is evident."
"Fuck Real Madrid.

That is all."
wow this is insane how is this not given
CLEAR DIVE LETS GOOOO
how does rudiger get away with everything
"VAR: Not a penalty. The defender was clearly wearing white!  
disgusting club, pathetic fans"
Now he’s given one
"so 3 fucking penalty shouts, really ?"
Rudiger has been ass this season.
The most whiny club of Spain does it again.
clear pen lol
Madrid have gotten away with 3 stonewall penalties tonight LMAO
"This is beyond shameless,  there is absolutely no excuse for missing this with the presence of var"
"Madrid bitches so much, but they have been bailed out so hard today lolol"
"Clear as day penalty. What’s the Madrid chant, corruption in the federation?"
Shameless how Rudiger always get away with the most obvious yellow cards and penalties
"He actually didn't touch him, the last replay shows it clearly"
Corruption. We could’ve had like 3 pens tonight
Bruh if this is not given...
Was there really a contact? Last angle shows zero contact ffs
Ball don’t lie
"Flagrant pen no given, shit penalty given and probably cancelled"
Bro this referee needs witness protection after this game.
Moises Llorens is a commentator and biggest Barca supporter. Even he admitted it wasn’t a pen. Some of these people just seek a meaningless agenda to push.
"/r/soccer 9/11. Barca dive and not called a penalty in the last minute. 

LMAO!!"
never ever a pen so arsocca will cry for corruption like a clockwork
Never a pen. Barely touches him. Would be very soft.
"From the replay, it doesn't look like there's contact. This is for the best. Barca needs to win without the ref having to make a decision. Fuck Madrid"
"Why he’s not placing penalty, it’s the most stonewall penalty ever. Asencio didn’t touch the ball at all. What the hell am I looking at?"
Marid are the villains but this was a dive
Clear as day dive lol
He was falling already before contact
Initially thought that was a clear pen but honestly the more I look at the replay it looks more and more like a dive
Is that the academy kid who was sharing underage porn?
That's a pen no?
Shameful dive
Literally zero contact! No penalty!
"what are you smoking? 

Hes not even touching him. 100% dive."
Clearly a dive.
Calling last minute pen would get the ref killed. Bullying works.
Nothing new 🙃
[ Removed by Reddit ]
the drama is crazy
Are referees afraid of Rudiger?
Premier sports commentator was talking the whole time that it's a clear penalty and was saying caught him with the right leg
People are crying over the penalty reversal but refereeing has been pretty good thus far. Hopefully it doesn’t fuck it up later on.
I’ll just say that Asencio was reckless and you wouldn’t have **many** complaints if the ref gave it.
"Looked worse in real time, still surprised it got overturned"
"I mean, i've seen them given

I've also seen them not given..."
Just rename to r/barca
Two clear pens not awarded I hope everyone saw this today this is clear corruption
"I must be freaking blind, I barely see any contact in the replay, Raphinha literally just dove, Asensio is dumb for even attempting a challenge there but I sincerely don’t see how that would’ve been a pen."
what a dive from Raphinha
What a dive. Hoooooly. Fallon d’Or material
Raphina clearly looking for the contact and falling early
"Asensio is such a clown to even try and dive in at 90+4 minutes.

Edit: Another Raphinha dive but point stands."
how is it not a penalty? and why RM will continue crying that about refs even after that ..
"Man, fuck this..."
"I don't even care about the final anymore. He's so conditioned. He called it off and he didn't give the Valverde, Ceballos and Rudiger penalties. I understand he doesn't want his kid bullied at school but this is unacceptable."
"Looking at the different angles, i do think he starts the dive, gets a push, but their isn’t contact from Acensio’s legs until he starts falling. When you look at the refs replays, I really cant say this is a pen."
Referee did good. From referee’s angle it looked like he tripped Raphinha but from behind it was clear there was no touch and Raphinha dived after feeling contact from trailing leg.
Soft contact lol
"As a Barca fan, there is contact but small enough imo, Rudiger touches Ferran a bit with his right foot but not enough for him to fall. I wouldn't call a penalty here."
He fell before the contact occured. If he kept it up it was an easy penalty
you shouldn't decide a game on this. play was going nowhere
I don't think he touched him at all. I could be blind but of the penalty calls during the match missed this is not one of them
That’s not a pen
Clear pen ffs
No fucking touch lol
"i cant believe this motherfucker is diving at that opportunity

Literally leaving everything he has achieved in such a shitty taste with shit like this"
"How the hell can people call this a pen? Clear as day dive, is Barca fans the most unbiased in the world? Wth"
"Barca fan here but that was a clear dive, Raphinha should have kept going and then trip over Raul Asenscio"
 I thought the one Rüdiger did was more of a pen than this
"Not a penalty, imo."
"Raphinha dives with his left leg, watch all angles. Even Moises Llorens on ESPN is saying no penalty."
Why did Raphinha dive? Caused him to avoid contact and I love it. But yeah Barca should have gotten a pen earlier.
"Raphina should get an Oscar for that dive, fooled me clearly. Probably the best dive I've ever seen, until they show the right angle and there is 0 contact on him lol"
I think I never saw a better dive in my life. Pre VAR 10/10 refs would get fooled and call a pen.
no penalty. i know real is a joke of a club but its obviously simulation.
Ref will be the protagonist
All wish VAR could have saved him there.
"he's gonna get hate from both teams lol, from barca because he was awful especially against them and from real because (they're whiny bitches) and because they lost, i feel bad for him too"
Why? He did a shit job
You jinxed them man. To be fair with what Madrid fielded in defense tge poor youngsters have been doomed anyway.
He already lost balance before that
"I don’t know about clear, it was 50/50 in my opinion.

Contact is not automatically a foul in my opinion and I am tired of players landing on their ass for simple contact.

He already lost balance pre contact, he already had the other defender on the ball.

I think ref was consistent from beginning in that he allowed hard tackles for today’s football standards and completely understand ref not giving a pen here."
"If Raphinha had just kept running, he'd have tripped over Asensio and gotten the pen"
Wrong video
It appeared that way until the VAR video. Asencio didn’t even touch him.
Yeah there’s contact but he dived early
You're correct.
Raphina just had to wait for the contact instead of diving before it
Well Raphinha dived early so there was no contact
But the sub is one real madrid hate(deserved) but none of these are pens
"As a real hater, this is never a pen"
Holy shit this barcelona-sub is dumb.. oh wait this isnt /r barca
Just like in real life sadly
It’s a penalty and a dive at the same time.
It’s legit why they do it.
Which were the others
"""Everything 50/50..."""
"VAR Room is asleep 

They woke up at the end of the game"
Is that not a dive? Honestly the other angle showed the lack of contact
Please explain to me how this is a penalty
Do you honestly think that was a penalty?
"which one?

the throws himself to the ground"
Tbf it looked like a pen until they showed the last angle
"It's not the crying that did the job. That's just extra, for dramatic purposes. It's the corruption that does it."
"The exact same thing wasn't a penalty on Brahim earlier this season either, but this sub was really quiet back then."
Open your eyes and you’ll see why this pen wasn’t awarded
"You are insane,ballerina football you can t give a penalty for such a small contact. Watch some rugby and man up"
"And you just know if those chances were *against* them, *both* of them would be given penalties.

Fucking disgrace."
This one is a dive
"The only one crying last week was the referee. 

Now kids at school will tell his kid his father is a crybaby.

A ref throws shade at a club 2 days before he officiates their cup final match against their biggest rivals and y'all think that's normal. They're supposed to stay neutral."
"That wasn’t a pen. Pretty clear dive from Raphina after the contact, also stuck out his left leg iirc"
You're on TV
"~~Blatant dive~~  
Edit: my bad wrong moment"
It’s a dive you bastard
If you speak RM will probably try to complain you’re influencing the ref lol. Like actually.
Var check...
"Gonna need another edit,"
This is the best dive I’ve ever seen in my life. It looks so much like a foul but he really didn’t touch him.
VAR is calling the ref over for that one
i feel like it might get overturned LOL (my stream is 2 mins behind tho lets see)
I wouldn't be shocked to see that one get pulled back though. It's less clear than this one.
"As much as I want Barca to win, I don’t want 0.8xg as a punishment for incidents like this."
It actually looked like a pen. If it wasn't for the other angle it will be given pen.
"Not a pen, clear dive"
Two what? Dives? I can’t with you people
Schrudiger's pen
How is this a dive? Do you know how balance works? He gets his foot kicked out from under him...
Dive happened before
You just want the lads in the VAR room to tell you what they see. The pressure would make me puke
"Not a pen, the player faked that so hard"
"Soft but yeah, it's one you want to go for you.

More than the one just given and about to be reversed."
Good thing you’re not a ref
And you are wrong lol
Dawg did you see the replay?? No contact
How? They got a pen after this for a clear dive
"Rudiger could kill a man and get away with it, he has crazy luck"
For a dive?
"If you're a soft baby, yes"
Maybe try watching the video. This is not the Raphinia one.
Really was none
That's what I'm seeing to... Don't like RM at all but I don't see a pen there. He dived.
There was none
Did you even watch the video? This is not the Raphinha dive
Did you watch the video? This isn't the Raphinha dive. Rudiger clearly hooks Ferran's leg...
Wrong thread. This is the Ferran one.
"Nope, not a pen"
It's so incredibly soft - I'd be fuming if given against my team tbh
Yeah where have I heard that before? Oh right. Chelsea
So fucking rigged. 1 RED AND 1 PEN
"This is 2 decisions close together,

The VAR overturn was correct but that's another thread.

This is before when Ferran had his leg hooked away."
"Wait I thought this was the post about the Raphinia one lmao, yeah this one is probably a pen."
"No, they just saw the links Barca fans posted earlier this week and assume"
Yeah crazy takes here. I am an avid hater but this is a clear dive.
Better book an eye check 😆
Rorsauch test for the world
How's that feel
"He starts going down before the contact, but there is contact...."
No way they are checking VAR
No as far as I know he was the one that alerted the boyfriend. The dude has been harassed for doing the right thing.
"U're blind or stupid
Both i guess"
From R/madrid I’m ok with that this place is full of crybabies anyway
You don't see Raphinha at all here because this is the thread about Rudiger on Ferran.
"There was CLEARLY contact. That’s not even debatable unless you are Madrid fan of course. 

Ya all been bitching all week and it worked."
"You're on the wrong thread, this is a different one."
VAR is scared shitless too today and didn’t want to intervene at all until they were forced to
"I actually agree with that, I am super happy Barca won. But I am tired of players landing on their ass for any simple contact and it being called a pen.

The striker already lost the balance, he lost the ball, had 2 defenders on him and the other defender would get to the ball anyway.

Contact is not automatically a foul!"
"Even if he already lost balance, who’s to say he wouldn’t catch himself until he got illegally kicked? It’s a foul and there’s not much more to it"
"Maybe you are right, and also right about ref not calling anything today. But as long as I remember a kick at heel is 100% call but I might be wrong.

Anyways, Visca Barca"
"That's what I thought, absolutely no reason to dive."
I think he thought the touch on his back was enough but clearly not lol
"I hate that’s that’s football now, players choose to flop rather than try and score"
Then he should have kept running and tripped over him to win a penalty
"Probably, yes."
"No, Asencio hits the back leg of Raphinha with his knee then he falls"
"He touches the leg behind with his knee but I dont think it was a penalty too, but wasnt a dive either"
Didn't he touch his back foot?
His right knee litteraly hits Raphinas left ankle...you can clearly see it on first replay.
The Cubarsi one should have been a pen. The one on Ferran would have been very soft and this is a dive.
"Asencio smacks him on the back, which makes him fall. The feet don't matter"
"yes there was contact lol, just open your eyes. The only problem is, Raphinha was already going down before the contact lol. Just because he dived doesn't mean there wasn't ALSO contact."
"Rudiger Ferran couldnt be clearer, crying succesful for this bitch of a club"
The Rudiger one was though… and the ceballos one was though….
Close enough
Where in the world is that a pen? Please guys protect refs! Fuckers
Penalti a favor del...
Also avoided a couple yellows and a red
The one on dani olmo almost olympic goal.
The one where the ball hit the post at the 44’ min
This one and Cubarsi
This and cubarsi pull I imagine
Tchouameni scissor tackle on Olmo from behind
Rudiger kicks his leg. Hope that helps. 
He kicks and lifts his leg. Textbook pen.
He kicks his leg. How is it not?
"He talks about the one on Cubarsi and one on Ferran probably, if Rapha kept running he would trip over Asencio leg but unlucky it was bad dive"
This is not the Raphinha penalty... Check the clip
Speak...it was a dive.
Rudiger kicks his ankle??
Barca DNA. They practiced diving to a perfection
Right hand pushing/hitting raphinha is the foul...fym not diving and no contact?
Raphinha going for BalonDor isnt enough for him lmao
"I fundamentally agree with this idea, make these ""non-scoring fouls"" in the box an indirect free kick from the spot of the foul. 

Conversely DOSGO *should* be a penalty and a yellow card rather than a red card, it's a punishment that actually fits the crime."
That last one was a blatant dive lmfao.
"Half or more people commenting here think this is about the Raphinha pen, you won't get through to anyone."
"I think people in this thread are talking about two different incidents lol, some the Raphinha incident and others the Ferran one. One a clear one and one a clear dive."
"After seeing more replays, I agree. He was already falling over before any contact."
a dive that actually impressed me rather than making me call him a diver
This is before the clip you're thinking of. This one's a clear penalty
I think you are talking about the wrong penalty. This is the Rudiger one where there is contact.
I think you should go to Specsavers. The contact was quite clear
It was not a clear dive until a second look in slowmo. Ref correctly overturned and gave a yellow for simulation. 
You’re in the wrong thread. This is the Ferran one
No point in actually having a discussion on this sub especially on Madrid games. To me it Initially looks like a clear pen but looking at the replay it seems there was barely any contact if any and Raphinha is already falling before that.
Literally every single one of your ucl has been won through scummy calls you dipshit
A taste of their own medicine
Still won it 😎
"How old are you bro? If you actually watched both legs, you could see that the referee was horrible for both sides."
Yeah I just saw the replay.. I guess the contact was not the trigger for him to fall
Chill buddy you're still in the game.. I commented before seeing the replay. Good luck the next 30 mins
"You are the idiot who thinks this is 23/24 season. VAR overturned it, correctly. Not even other barca fans think that's a penalty. Stop calling people stupid, you're probably the dumbest commenter I've seen here."
seems like you are the only one seeing that but whatever.
both are dogshit and filled with people that watch highlights only.
lol! I didn’t even think this play was worth a second look. No chance that’s a pen
He swiped his foot of course he fell it’s a clear foul
"Watch the second angle. Ferran loses his balance first but gets it back before he turns. He's stood in a stable position until Rudiger swipes his left leg out. 

Clear penalty."
wtf dawg it's a clear pen 🤦‍♂️
Visca la Barca!
Always been
"That has been football since the 80s what is this ""now"" you talk off?"
"Yes, that's what I'm saying"
"I think that shouldn't be a penalty either, its still faking it. But yes, referees show it anyway..."
"Yes? This is the Torres shout not the Raphina one, watch the video lmfao"
You think the rules let you knee the ankle of the attacker whenever you want?
Nope you can watch it again.
Not to mention how he shoved his back.
There was an angle where there was absolutely no contact even when Raphinha was fallin half way down already.
This is the rudiger one…
This is the Rudiger one
Straight up kicking his leg while he is holding the ball? Look again mate
"idd, most obvious dive ive seen in a long time"
And the one where rudiger kicks the back leg
You have a video of the cubarsi
"That one is 2 guys holding each other, it cant be called as they both commited fouls simoutaneously. This one is a pen though."
Are you blind lmao how is this a penalty?
"Don,t forget fede hand ball"
What this one? It’s a clear dive from raphinha.
As a neutral this just looks like a dive
What about the Rudiger one?
"People don't read articles before commenting, and you seriously expect them to watch GIFs?"
Lol I commented on the wrong penalty. How did I get 50 upvotes for saying something completely wrong?
Bayern fans always dickriding Madrid.
"Hand, Cubarsi, Torres - 3"
"Dude, how do you miss the reference?"
Cant blame people including me for thinking that. the game is a penalty shout machine lol.
"A lot of people just saw the title and think they are responding to the Asensio Rafinha incident, but this is another incident"
"Correct, so if there’s was pressuring tactic I don’t think he’d have been inclined to give a penalty to begin with."
yes barcelona number 7 raphinha. are you serious did you watch the clip before you posted this shit?
I've waited 16 years.
"Xd cry ma a river 
Do you know which situation the video is about?
Ferran's leg being swept
It was not overturned cuz they never checked it 
And even commentators said it should've been checked"
I agree but I feel like it’s really more prevalent now that var checks every micro contact
"ah right, thoguht you were implying it should have been a pen even if raphina never made contact"
Ooops sorry. The order of the posts got me
Honestly it's weird af. But Raphina seemed to be going down even before any contact. I don't know why the action before with Ferran wasn't checked tho
"It was posted here, I don't know if it's still up."
Ever tried to plant your foot and have it kicked out from under you?
"Fede’s wasn’t a penalty. Rules have changed, no handball if you’re using the hand to support your body"
"He's falling down, he has to put his hand down to break the fall"
Not a penalty imo
"Brother, this is the one on Ferran. Raphinha was a dive."
If thats a penalty i dont want to watch football anymore 
"Oh go whine somewhere else, one mistake should not be corrected by another"
"Bro watch how inigo marks rudiger in your corners. You would have conceded 2 pens on shirt pulling by the same standard. 


Even the second goal for madrid, watch how inigo pulls rudiger"
"They think you forgot to add ""/s"" for being totally wrong"
They sure didn’t like Barca daddy spanking them in the CL this year.
"Kane complained today about refs like Madrid, what do you expect?"
"Hand wasn’t a pen, cubarsi one is an issue as it doesn’t get called anywhere else weirdly, the Torres one is wild cause that’s 100% a pen"
"I saw the Cubarsi one and thought initially penalty, replay shows they are both pulling on each other. so who do you call the foul on?  You can argue the attacker was affected but they were both holding on each other before the ball was close."
True justice is these teams never get benefits from referees. Be them called real Madrid or Barcelona. Have all the referees always check everything on var for them
"I suppose that wouldn't be the craziest argument I've seen on reddit, but no, I was mostly annoyed at Raphinha (and also at the VAR officials for not reviewing Cubarsi having his clothes torn off in the box earlier)"
"When I saw it live I thought it was a stonewall pen but the more replays they showed, the more I realized it was just a *really* well timed dive. 

Funny thing is he didn’t even need to dive, if he just kept on running there would’ve been sufficient contact between him and asencio for a pen to be given."
"Found it, there was also a valverde hand that I couldn't find but alas Barca win so I'm good"
Lmao sorry bro I thought I was in the other thread with Raphinha lol
Show me one frame of the planted foot being kicked and I'll venmo you 500 bucks
I don't see how you are supporting your weight when your hand is fully extended and doesn't even touches the ground
Ironically his hand didn’t even support his fall the ball hit then he colapses to the floor without his arm supporting his fall.
"which is a fucking idiotic rule, if you fall over I see the point, but when you purposefully do a sliding tackle and touch it with your hand it should be a pen imo"
Ironically he doesn’t break the fall with his arm though
"Bullshit this one is not as well, calling that a tackle from Rudiger is just wishful thinking. The only one that is a soft penalty that can be given is Cubarsi."
"Maybe just don’t watch then, because Rudiger’s is a clear penalty."
Your team gets those calls. You haven’t stopped watching football?
"If there were no mistakes, who would be winning?"
"A literal minute before raphinha's dive, there was a clear tripping of ferran's as well. 
Just say youre not watching the game if you wanna yap and make no sense"
It's so shameless lmaooo
It is handball according to the rules since he isn't supporting himself. The rules are very clear.
Yes? What do you not understand? He wasn't even on ground and he touched with hand
"For me only thing why hand wasn't pen is because nobody was behind him. If Yamal was there that would be pen for sure, but he didn't even touch the ground and it was handball"
They are holding but he literally stopping Cubarsi from scoring that is big difference. At least that desereved VAR checking just like Ferran
Its a scuffle between two players
"They get a pass on that one. If a player uses their hand or arm to support their body when falling or sliding, and the hand/arm is in a natural position to support themselves, it is not considered a handball offense, even if the ball touches it. Valverde was on the ground using that arm to support himself.
The other ones had me fuming though."
That's a losing bet right there. True gambler mentality.
"He started falling before Rudi even put his foot on the grass, c'mon. Clear dive"
"Sorry, that's how it sounded like"
Hes fucking falling? You're mental if you think any of those 3 are pens
I see what you’re saying and as a neutral I don’t really mind the decision… obviously if it was against my team I’d be fuming regardless
and Cubarsi is holding the defender back. it works both ways
"lmao he literally pulls his shirt off holding him back, hes inches from scoriing."
"Yeah I didn't see it, people were telling it's a handball so I just wanted to check it out. Thanks for clarifying"
"Lmaoooo sorry I thought I was in the other thread, the one with Raphinha"
I do have a gambling problem tho lol
Rudiger's foot tangled w his. Rudiger's clumsiness is not ferran's fault
"Come on mate.. its never a penalty, cubarsi is grabbing ceballos aswell."
Ferran added a lot there
"Biased opinion. Ive seen penalties for less, his literally holding him."
"You could be right,  i could be right. 
Do you see the optics of the whole thing tho? 5 seconds for that check, and 5 mins for raphinha's check. 
Go back in the match, a foul on cubarsi in the box (clearest penalty shout of the match) that wasn't even given a second thought."
Aston Villa did not show up at all this game
Palace winning it would be awesome
Now Forest to make the final too
"See you in the Final, fuckers. Up the Palace."
"UP THE FUCKING PALACE AHHHHHH

I am fucking THROBBING right now. Any harder and its going to fucking pop off and shoot around the room like a rogue balloon."
Let's go Palace! Take it all the way!
please palace idc who they have in the final they have to win
"We were shit. Palace defence was incredible and then they just picked us a part on the attack. Lucky it was only 3. Good game Palace, please go on and win it."
Not much do you can do when you keep having to play Palace Saint-Germain
Is Oliver Glasner currently the most underrated manager?
I can imagine how disappointed Aston Villa fans are with this end to the season.
Time for Glasner to start learning the Pardew dance.
Absolute battering that was.
https://giphy.com/gifs/3o7qDMlVquZI1axqQ8
Now go win it
"congratulations, Palace. hope you go on and win it!"
"As a neutral, this match was absolute cinema"
A lot of anxiety just slid off my shoulders.
I've been umming and ahhhhhing about getting our jersey this season and the boys did me proud so Im shooting the trigger
Could've been 5-0 easy
Good on 'em. Hope they win it now if only to shut up the folk that talked about how dull is must be for having the gall to finish safely year in and out.
Nottingham please please PLEASE beat Man City
2025 FA Cup winner you heard it here first
Would love to see them win the lot. Eze and Mateta are a great watch.
"They have totally dominated Villa and played really well... really loved Wharton+Sarr what a midfield and not to mention the magic boy Eze or the absolute hard working tank Mateta!


Now if we get Nottingham too it would be a great game for the purists hehe and also neutrals like me."
Get in here lads. Up the palace
… did villa even play ?
 Should have been 4. No idea how that first goal was disallowed
Eze is a dream
One of the most impressive team performances I’ve seen all season. Palace were fucking outstanding.
Be great if Palace could go on and win it 👏
Suddenly the 2-2 draw doesn't look so bad for Arsenal
Game's back.
They played the perfect game
"Good job Palace, you lot deserved it and played the far superior game today."
I've never been satisfied about the use of REACHED as the correct past participle 
"as a Brighton fan, this is nightmare fuel….

I don’t care who makes it to the finals, if palace don’t win I’m a happy man"
Palace v Forest final let's gooo
"Nice, i hope they win it"
"we made this Villa side look unbeatable, funny old game football

Would be great if the domestic cups are won by us and Palace this year. Nice to see new names on silverwear"
GO ON LADS!!!
Robert S. Pearson is dancing with joy.
3rd time's the charm.
Honestly it's been an interesting season so far.
I love english football this year.
"Well deserved, I tuned into the game and they were very well organised and deadly on the counter. Mateta is such an amazing ball carrier and Eze really paces things. I hope they win the final, city winning it every year isn't how it should be."
Villa focusing on the champions league-oh
LETS FUCKIN GO PALACE
Hole Tenders in tatters
"Win fair and square, found Villa team very tired physically compared to Sarr / Mateta / Wharton effort, must have made the difference"
Ramsey eating his words right now
Palace played very well but my god Villa were awful.
Aston villa have had a fall from grace recently
palace > psg
"Glasner has won 4 of the last 5 against Emery (other was a draw). A lot of times, they're blow-outs (5-0, 4-1, this game). He just has him completely figured out."
Someone get Alan Pardew to dance
"Palace Forrest final would be great, both would fight with their lifes for trophy."
"The fan deserves it. Really under-represented in online communities. 

The stadium has one of the best atmosphere in PL."
Dear lord please no
Hard disagree
"Please god. If after that QF line up if we get a final of City smashing Palace, then I'm going to be so bloody disappointed."
Thought the same! Would be really good match to see Palace and Forest against each other in the final.
Best possible combo
Go and win it 🫡
Hope you lot go all the way.
Win the Europa league please
WTF is going to happen if you lot win it if this is your reaction of reaching the finals
That mental image was.... disturbing
Always been a huge fan of CP
If we won against Newcastle and City he would've been one foot into the Leipzig door already
"He was the next big thing. Then he was shite. Now he's underrated. 

The only thing we know is that Palace will still finish 12th. Hopefully with an FA cup too though."
2nd half of the season Glasner is a different being
Glasner is a cup merchant but he’s so good at it that he can even do it with Palace
"Palace knocked them out of both cups, and took four points off them in the league.  If they miss CL qualification by a couple of points Palace will really have been almost single-handedly responsible for fucking their season up."
It is both the best and worst-looking top. I love it.
Would be great to see palace win. Fuck sportswashing.
"no, fuck oil clubs"
We haven’t seen that Villa team since that win because he keeps playing different players. He’s lost the plot recently
He cracked the Good Ebenining enigma
The opposite of Arteta. We've smashed nearly all of our demons at some point but we can't ever seem to have a convincing match against Villa
Big physical striker with pacey wingers against Pau Torres is a winning combination. Cannot for the life of me figure out why Ming’s didn’t start over him.
Figuratively
NO DEAR GOD NO
Lad - let me enjoy this win without having to think about that fucking dance
"Don't mention Alan Pardew in the context of a cup final. Last time he played one, he lost to a team that was basically bankrupt."
Match gets abanfoned after 30 rounds of pend from a 5-5 ET finish. Shared glory
"> The stadium has one of the ~~best~~only atmosphere in PL.

FTFY lol"
"It's unfortunate (for City haters) that they kept getting lower league opposition during that period where they were at their worst. 2 games to go, they could absolutely see it through now. They've already beaten Palace recently and Forest's form hasn't been the best lately."
"Would make the final terrifying playing Palace as I feel like there would be expectation to bring the trophy back.

Tomorrow I'd love to win but I'm mainly going for a good time.

At least I wouldn't begrudge Palace winning it , tbh the only London team to visit the city ground and  bring some noise"
Hopefully city don't make it boring!

I'm always throbbing after watching an hour and a half of CP
When he beats City to lift it that’ll fix that
He was dealt a bit of a rough hand with Zaha and Olise leaving but it seems to have course corrected itself
are Palace an oil club?
Gooooood Night Emoriee
Good Ebenigma for short
[YES DEAR GOD YES](https://giphy.com/gifs/3o7qDMlVquZI1axqQ8)
I keep hearing about it on the football ramble but never seen it
It's about the journey
cheers for the 6 points lad
I expect them to see it through unfortunately.
"Forest will park it, but we’re dog so who knows?"
Has Palace ever been in Europe before? Genuine question.
"If he wins us the FA Cup he can go wherever he bloody well likes and take any of our players he wants.

My Dad is in his 70s. I just want to go to Wembley with him and see us lift a proper trophy."
"I assume they'll end up being one too sooner or later, but I was talking about Newcastle."
The fact thst United equalizes less than 5min after this makes funnier
[IDK why but his dance reminded me of this old honey badger gif](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZmM5bGhscHU2Z3psOGU0ZDVveHp6YXhrcnZwb2R4bGoyNGZqZ2FsdiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/f8k6R32qjJGV2/giphy.gif)

"Yes, once, but it was the Intertoto Cup in a year we finished bottom and nobody else applied to enter. We crashed out against a noname Turkish club immediately.

It could be the first time we properly qualify for Europe."
"I believe they would have played in Europe in 1990/91 as they finished 2nd in the FA cup the prior season and Man United (who won) would have qualified through the league, but English teams were still banned following this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heysel_Stadium_disaster.

That rule about the runner up qualifying if the winner was already qualified obviously no longer exists."
"If it’s not against Forest you’ll have the support of 18 other clubs.

Maybe 17, to be fair to Brighton."
And went on to win it in extra time despite being a man down
"Context? The dance, I mean."
"Sometimes I miss Pards.

That newcastle team for the like season and a half where things were going well was a lot of fun to watch"
Oh my god HAHHA
"We once got fined for fielding a team of retired ex players and academy boys in the Intertoto. Despite the fact it invites further stick, vis a vis trophies, i do hope you get a result. Got no beef with Palace and it'd be good for English football to have some more new trophy blood."
I'm praying for you guys to win the FA Cup. Palace in Europe and having a slim chance of getting into CL would be the story of a lifetime.
"We were going to qualify that season anyway because we finished 3rd in the League, and the European ban was over by that point for everyone except Liverpool. Except Liverpool’s ban got magically cut short by two years in April when it was becoming obvious that we would qualify for European… and because the coefficient was so bad, only the top two qualified."
"more than 18 clubs, the entirety of the footballing world"
jesse lingard at wembley was genuinely world class
Crystal Palace went 1-0 up against Man Utd in the fa cup final in 2016. Pardew did the dance to celebrate. United went on to equalise 3 minutes later and won in extra time. Pardew got made fun of for celebrating early
"The highs of a Pardew team are brilliant, a shame he never had a clue how to turn things around when the going got tough."
"the Pardew slide. once it starts, there is no stopping it."

Imagine going after Ian Wright of all people. What a muppet.
Wrighty looking fashionable.
The problem with Eni is that I she’s not very bright.
Lol at people asking Wright to forgive so that he can move on. One doesn't always need to forgive those who have wronged them to move on from it.
"Honestly, I agree with Ian here."
"No need to accept the apology, she was completely in the  wrong. Never a fan of dragging shit out on social media rather than behind closed doors, but you don't have to accept every apology. 

There are very few people that have done more for the women's game than him, and the commentary and broadcast should be to both men and women instead of  restricting it."
"Beyond being the biggest voice for the women's game Ian has gone out of his way to even pay for surgery/rehab of players who's clubs haven't done so.

No need for him to accept the apology, there's not many people who have done more fo the women's game in England than Uncle Ian."
"Ian has done more for women’s football punditry than Eni has, if everywhere you go stinks of shit maybe you should check the bottom of your shoe…"
Completely OOTL. What is the backstory?
Is there anyone more loved than Ian Wright in football? It's like trying to have a pop at father Christmas!
"What I can’t fathom is the fact that women more then ever are on the men’s game. 

How could you suggest that men shouldn’t be be on the women’s game but women can be on the man’s with a straight face."
"She’s complaining that Wright takes up a space in women’s football coverage and there’s not enough opportunities for women broadcasters and pundits in the men’s game. The thing is when I watch women’s football on the bbc and sky, their highlights show or live coverage, it’s nearly entirely women. Ian Wright being there pretty often is actually a plus I would argue, it normalizes men having an interest in the game and shows it’s not just for women. For her to single out Ian Wright and say something as wishy washy as “you should be aware of how much you’re in the women’s game” is saying “you’re not welcome here, and I want a bigger job in the men’s game”. Not a very sympathetic position."
"I think it's totally fair for Ian not wanting to accept the apology, but at the same time wanting to move on. Eni should have known better and an apology isn't going to fix that relationship.  
Hopefully this ""situation"" ends here though."
"He is right, stop normalising people saying purposely shit things to harm people and then accepting their apologizing like nothing happened"
It was a disgraceful comment Ian Wright has done so much for the women's game. That must have felt like a kick to the guts.
"Her apology was shit. It got halfway to the point. She’s right that Wrightys name should not have been brought up. But she fails again to do what she should have done during the podcast - acknowledge the great work that Ian has done for women’s football and how he uplifts women.

I get the sense she doesn’t understand what was wrong with what happened. Just because you have one good point doesn’t mean everything you say is okay."
Wrights a legend for almost scoring a goal per game his entire career
"She's a terrible representative for the women's game and I hope she's off TV for good after this. Despite being a spiteful bitch, she's also one of the worst pundits I've seen, and that bar is fucking LOW."
"I hope this saga ends Aluko's punditry career. 

Firstly because she's genuinely shite at it. 

But secondly, she's doing more damage to the reputation and acceptance of the women's game than she is helping it grow at this point."
How can someone treat Ian like an asshole? Literally the nicest guy out there for fuck sake.
She only apologised because she was facing the sack. Understandable.
"Yeah, rightly so. She’s a fucking moron."
She’ll probably call him a racist now for not accepting her apology.
"Wrighty is one of the most genuine people in football, and tries to bring others up with him instead of pulling the ladder up.

It’s great that he’s advocating for all levels of the game without wanting fanfare for it, and he’s not being performative about it. Aluko has honestly targeted the one person who doesn’t have an agenda and it’s backfired massively on her."
The saddest thing about this is that he probably considered her to be a friend before all this.
I fucking love Ian Wright. Such a calm and grounded voice in a mad football environment. He’s just a proper good human.
There's only two reasons you pick a fight with someone who's universally liked and who knows exactly how to play the pr game A) stupidity or B) crass cynicism - she just wants the media attention even if it's negative because that's still more valuable than being irrelevant.
"Former England international Aluko has attracted headlines and criticism this week after comments made during an appearance on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, in which she appeared to suggest that ITV colleague Wright’s presence across women’s football coverage risked “blocking” opportunities for female broadcasters.

""I've worked with Ian a long time and, you know, I think he's a brilliant broadcaster, but I think he's aware of just how much he's doing in the women's game. I think he should be aware of that,"" Aluko said.

""The fact of the matter is, there is a limited amount of spaces available. If we had a situation where there was an equal opportunity in the men's game for broadcasters and coaches that there is in the women's game, it's a free for all.

But that's not the case. I can't dominate the men's game in the way that, you know, you used Ian as an example.""

Asked if she thought it was wrong for Wright to cover women’s football, she replied: “I don't know about wrong, but I think we need to be conscious and we need to make sure that women are not being blocked from having a pathway into broadcasting in the women's game.

It's still new, it's still growing. There's a finite amount of opportunities and I think that men need to be aware of that.""

Aluko responded to criticism of her comments by taking to social media and dismissing “clickbait headlines” as she shared a link to both the full interview and relevant section in question."
She really is a Muppet
"and nor should he accept it because I would say the apology itself was forced. To make excuses for her own short comings by blaming others is poor but naming Wright was down right disrespectful. It's not the first time she has  talked shit. And tbh it kinda taints her accusations about the England manager while she was playing too. 

The only person holding her back is her herself, She's a very poor pundit, woman or not."
Someone who has no talent or morals tries to take down a person that does. Detestable woman and I genuinely hope this is the last anyone ever hears of her. A full time victim who points the finger at everyone but herself. Has played the gender and the race card repeatedly. Basically a female Joey Barton.
"Aluko is ironically turning into Joey Barton.

Can only say controversial stupid things to stay relevant"
Good on him not accepting the apology.
I watch Crouch with 2 female commentators after a game yesterday. Thought we were past this nonsense
Wrighty's a top bloke and he seems like the forgiving type. For him to not accept her apology speaks volumes  about Aluko's character (or lack thereof).
"Classy response, he's honest about his disappointment without dogging Eni or pushing this further, he just wants to say his piece and move on."
Simple as - https://youtu.be/I745Ajeq_B8?si=yH1ijPvNd426_zVq
She constantly just says ridiculous things and labels anyone who doesn’t agree with her as sexist/racist. If it was a male saying the things she does I’d say the exact same.
"get her ass wrighty! she’s a mockery of womens football, can’t hold a candle to other pundits."
Nice one Wrighty
Scotland invented modern football
"I really dislike Aluko, she's a horrible racist with a face of a slapped arse most the time, she spouts nonsense or terrible opinions then plays the race or sexist card when called out on it."
"Go on Unc. You tell her, and we wholeheartedly support you"
"It's nice that he still took the time to recognise a part of her point about his privilege. I wish the media covered that part in the headlines instead of ""Ian Wright REJECTS Aluko apology"". But you can see this stings a bit because they did seem to have a good friendship and as he said he's done a lot to support her."
Matching a hulk with the text on his shirt. Super stylish
Ooooohhh sheeeeeet Eni donzo
He also says can we leave it there and put it in the past. While I too am upset on uncle Ian’s behalf I respect his wishes. I shall say no more.
Ootl...whats going on?
Pure class. Watch and learn Eni
Wearing and Anthony Edwards Shirt while saying that is an Interesting choice. Get da Abortion
"What was she thinking, it's like going after footballs Paddington bear."
"I get what she was going for. I can see how it might be frustrating that one of the most prominent people in the women's game is a man. But every marginalised group needs allies from the predominant group. No movement will go anywhere if it isolates itself from people willing to help.

But her implication seems to be that no men should work in the women's game at all and I don't know if she has thought that through. It would give the impression that women's football is only for women in all aspects. Fan included. And that would be a terrible thing."
Just meet up chat and iron it out. Too grown to be in this mess
"They can have only women pundits, and continue being irrelevant and unwatched forever."
"Easy to slag Eni off but I think you have to understand where everyone is coming from here. 

She is seeing her female teammates get turned down for jobs because men are getting them, and then in female games she sees the same thing happening!

ITV are trying to grow the women’s game (for profit admittedly), and asking Ian Wright is an excellent move, if they select female ex players nobody’s heard of, their ratings will suffer.

Ian Wright is simply trying to help grow the women’s game too, he could easily do bigger jobs but he genuinely cares about it."
IIT: A bunch of brogressives taking Aluko's comments out of context
Nice way for both of them to keep it in the media. Gonna get more headlines this way.
"Honestly, when on top be gracious and accept the apology. This hardly needs to become a grudge match with sides taken and social media barricades built.

Edit - I see the barricade has been built! As I knew it would be."
If David Beckham was the one doing it? I doubt this is an issue.
What has Ian Wright actually done for the Women’s game? I’m OOTL.
"I always find these types of situations so childish. It's understandable that you didn't like her comments, but making videos about it ? For what? If you really want to talk about the situation, just meet up with her in person."
"What makes it even stranger is that by her own logic, she shouldn't be covering the mens game. I don't really care who is a pundit as long as they're good at their job but surely there's a double standard there"
Aluko would have had at least a somewhat valid point if she directed her criticism at almost every male pundit covering women's games apart from Wrighty. He's always championed women's football and is genuinely passionate about it. I started following the Arsenal women's team because of him.
"Is there a chance she may have got Ian Wright and Joey Barton mixed up? She does seem a bit dense, bless her"
"The irony is, I don't think she intended to. I mean look it was really fucking thick of her to say.

As someone that read the original article and quotes, it sounds like she was asked a loaded question and answered it horribly. She's had some notable stinkers as a pundit and it wouldn't shock me if that absence of common sense caused her latest problem. 

When I read what she'd said, I don't think she was intending to suggest Wright had literally blocked her from opportunities, more that those in the booking jobs had given him a monopoly of opportunities."
"That's like saying the sky is blue, mate"
He’s a national treasure to be protected in the British museum
When he picked the outfit he made sure the rolex matched the shirt.
Qualified solicitor- she’ll make herself the victim / throw out Joey Barton’s name again
"No, she's clearly very smart.

She is, in my own opinion, just not very interesting.

Look at Jill Scott, she is going great guns. Kelly Cates, a total pro.

It's all done fairly brutally - your name gets you in the door and you have to engage the audience andnifnyuu can't, you're gone"
"Exactly. Forgive and forget doesn't really work, because we don't forget. Acknowledging an apology doesn't mean you accept it, and that all is suddenly dandy. Let the guilty live with their guilt."
Two wrongs don't make a Wright.
"I just can't understand why Aluko, as much of a narcissist as she is, decided to come after him like that.

You can see the hurt on his face. He helped her at points in her career and she threw it back in his face.

To target Ian Wright, as well, who is probably the male footballer who has championed the women's game the most, is just ridiculous.

Really hope Eni Aluko is sacked over this debacle. She certainly should not have the privilege of covering the women's Euros this summer."
"You need household names in these punditry, broadcasting roles. Whether it’s Ian wright, Carra, Henry, or Christine Sinclair, Alex Morgan, Marta etc.

The female household names are fewer at this point in time, as the game grows there will be more. But you shouldn’t be replacing Ian Wright with females that nobody has heard of. The woman’s game needs big names to grow to be able to create more female household names in the sport, so they can eventually fill these roles. Ostracizing the few that support the game will only send it backwards and farther from that goal. Eni needs to have some awareness to know the women’s game is at a critical point where they need to gather support, not divide it"
Its also quite damning on he doesn't her apology. He knows her comments were not misguided or ignorant. They were purposefully malicious.
"From everything I have heard and seen about Aluko well before this past few days, I'm afraid it's not sth at bottom of her shoe that's the POS..."
"Ian Wright has been probably the biggest voice for the woman's game in England. Eni Aluko basically said that because of his presence and popularity he has blocked women from getting positions in the woman's game.

Basically an attack at probably the biggest advocate there is for the woman's game. Wright is correct to not be pleased with her comments."
"Ein Aluko chose to pick fight with the most supportive person in women’s football 

She claimed Unc Ian is blocking women for getting commentary gigs in women’s football"
"Ian's a huge proponent of women's football, especially the England Women's national team, to the point where he takes on media roles for their and other women's football games. 

Eni Aluko went on BBC Radio 4 and complained about Ian blocking opportunities for women in the sport because he takes up jobs working as a pundit and commentator for women's football that could otherwise be going to a woman."
"Somebody chose to attack him publicly regarding him blocking female punditry opportunities even though he's probably the biggest champion of the women's game and very vocally/ publicly supports it . Shes always playing this victim card, and saying men should not be involved in the women's game since it's limited. Another random female player then shared a story about how her club wasn't covering her rehab costs but Ian was doing it privately out of pocket.

She issued an ""apology"" aka trying to save face after all the backlash she received. Fair that Wrighty isnt accepting it."
"She did a podcast where she said there's a risk of male pundits dominating the female game. Wright does pundit work for women's football and she said there's a risk of women being blocked from their own sport, because they cannot easily get in to the men's game.

It ignores all the good work Wright has done for the women's game."
"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cgkg8kjlp80o


It's not quite an all out attack on Wrighty and I think it's quite thoughtful even if I don't fully agree with her.

""In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour Aluko, 38, says Wright needs to be aware of how much he works in the women's game as there are only a ""finite amount of opportunities"" for women.

Wright is a major advocate of women's football and has regularly worked as a pundit, especially covering the Lionesses.

""I've worked with Ian a long time and, you know, I think he's a brilliant broadcaster, but I think he's aware of just how much he's doing in the women's game. I think he should be aware of that,"" said Aluko.

""The fact of the matter is, there is a limited amount of spaces available. If we had a situation where there was an equal opportunity in the men's game for broadcasters and coaches that there is in the women's game, it's a free for all.

""But that's not the case. I can't dominate the men's game in the way that, you know, you used Ian as an example.""

Asked if she thinks it is wrong for Wright to cover women's football, Aluko added: 'I don't know about wrong, but I think we need to be conscious and we need to make sure that women are not being blocked from having a pathway into broadcasting in the women's game.

""It's still new, it's still growing. There's a finite amount of opportunities and I think that men need to be aware of that."""""
To be fair that prick gave me a lump of coal one year when I know i did all my chores. Never forgave him for that
"> How could you suggest that men shouldn’t be be on the women’s game but women can be on the man’s with a straight face.

Because when you look at the history of the women's game, one is lifting women up while the other is keeping them down: Men have banned women from playing for half a century, so might as well try to make up for that like Ian Wright does.

And why *shouldn't* we have female pundits or commentators in the men's game? It's hardly like being a good pundit (Rio Ferdinand) is a prerequisite, and neither is having played men's football (Noel Gallagher)."
"No he didn't, lol!"
She’s wondering now - how can I make myself the victim
And a bigot.
Ian is lucky to be black in this situation
She intimated him working on women's games so frequently could be costing opportunities for female pundits
He has every right to give his opinion on the points she raised. He’s really not focusing on the personal and I’m interested to hear his take on this.
"If someone makes a comment about you publicly, you're well within your rights to give your response publicly"
Or Eni Aluko can just not make comments that are rude and incorrect.
brogressive lol that's a new one
"Not really though is it. 

She had a bit of a point but made it poorly, showed shite judgement by bringing someone who is well loved in the football community, and she fails to realise that her own presence as a pundit is zero to do with talent or meritocracy. She is a useless pundit and her gender and/or race have fuck all to do with it. She’d be better focusing on improving rather than calling out bullshit reasons she isn’t presenting match of the day."
They know each other personally. I feel this goes deeper than just their public professional personas. Sometimes stuff is just like that.
Yeah bit weird
"Maybe he finds it easier to accept an apology from a stranger who has changed their damaging views, than he finds it to accept an apology from someone he knows personally who, seemingly, has offended him.

He's probably in a hard place where if he doesn't comment, he will constantly be asked about it, and just wants to stop being asked so that he *can* move on."
Wrighty is absolutley within his rights here and does not need to accept the apology. It isn’t about being on top. His name was brought up specifically in a negative light when he is clearly passionate about women’s football and also understands the challenges the women’s game faces even in punditry - Wrighty has supported women’s football and wants to continue supporting it. But now there is a seed planted potentially regarding him actually getting in the way. It was a thoughtless comment but it’s not the first time Aluko has dropped a bomb like this.
"Based on what he said about her conversations with him/his management, I sense that the two were privately on very good terms, and he feels what she said was 100% a disingenuous ""play"" by her. Just my baseless speculation. What she said was very serious, so I can understand him not being okay with accepting a social media apology."
Eni Aluko criticised Ian publicy and then only apologised when she got backlash. Ian absolutely does not need to accept her apology.
"It definitely didn’t because it doesn’t address what was the issue. Ian Wright is not blocking women from becoming great broadcasters, but Aluko won’t say that because she does think he is."
I was wondering how redditors would make an argument between two black people about racism and you’ve just managed it. Incredible.
What does this even mean?
Probably the only male pundit who actively publicly champions the women’s game every opportunity he can. Pundits for nearly every England international game on itv. Hosts a podcast with former England captain Steph Houghton weekly on the WSL and goings on in women’s football. Actively wants to learn about the game and help where he can
This. He was the reason i started following the Arsenal Womens team more closely.
She would have to be leaking braincells if she got them both mixed up
Dominates the fashion game
"He’d have to be Egyptian, Italian, Irish, Indian or Greek to be in there"
"Two things can be true at the same time

1) Eni is a terrible pundit and deeply unserious person

2) Barton is an evil thug - an absolute low life"
Can we just all blame Joey Barton and move on?
I’m not sure I’d rush to have her representing me.
Bit of an icky comment tbh mate
"> No, she's clearly very smart.

No she isn't.

If she was we wouldn't be in this thread right now."
"Nieve Petruziello (Stuntpegg), too, she deserves to be a pundit for a PL or WSL match."
"Except some people are sociopathic and aren't really affected by guilt much at all. That's why shaming and ostracising exist, rightly or wrongly."
You can even accept an apology and still think the person is stupid.
Its not forgive and forget. Its forgive but never forget. Atleast for me.
Cus she ain't that bright. Remember when she just casually dropped that she colluded to prop up transfer fees? Folk like that just dont think about things like others helping them in the past.
"She's shit at her job anyway and always has been. She's the token woman on the broadcast blocking others from getting a shot at a job because she certainly doesn't get the job for having a good personality or analysis. Who the fuck actually wants to listen to her? Get rid, won't be missed."
Some women just hate men
"It’s because she’s doing it for clout, not to actually help grow the game."
Also if it's just women in the commentary/pundit team it sends a message of segregation. That women's football is separate completely to the mens game. But one of the best things about the womens game is it's the same teams! It's the same game.
Janine Beckie is also great for TSN whenever the Euros (men and women) comes around. The women's game needs to heavily prioritize pundits with insight on the skills they've built up as players more than anything.
"There have been a lot of comments about her being a bell end for years to people. I imagine Wright has heard things that none of us have, from producers and other behind the camera staff, as well as people in the women's game, and has thought ""nah fuck that, she's a known shit bag and does this thing often"".

It's nice when this stuff is exposed and double nice when you hear about the nice things Wright has been doing for the women's game without taking any credit for it."
"Absolute cheek of it, when she's constantly on punditry during the men's game. She's thicker than a corned beef sandwich and genuinely gives off the impression of somebody that has never watched football, let alone play the game."
"> Eni Aluko basically said that because of his presence and popularity he has blocked women from getting positions in the woman's game.

[Here's the interview, relevant bit starts about 38 minutes in](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m002b6w7) - I'm not quite sure I agree with your characterisation of her comments to be quite honest. She's not the one bringing up his name, she's clearly acknowledging what Ian Wright has done for the women's game, and then makes a wider point about the gender imbalance in women's football including both punditry and management while pointing out it's important to be conscious about the scarce amount of positions and pathways that currently exist in a young game."
You’d think someone close to her would sit her down  - grifter dug her own grave
And he has every right not to accept it. What a slap in the face.
"It also ignores two things less appetising 1) Ian Wright is more high profile than anyone in the women’s game and brings exposure to the game as a result, 2) the top level of the men’s game is a higher level of football than the top level of the women’s game so in a sense it’s like a Championship player complaining an ex PL pundit is covering the Championship but that a Championship player can’t dominate the PL coverage.  It’s disrespectful honestly because someone like Aluko is not a great pundit, has less football experience (or at least at a level that can’t be argued to be superior) and it just seems her argument is men shouldn’t be allowed to do it."
"Doesn't sound half as bad as people are making out. Doesn't come off as ""malicious"" or ""attacking"" Wright to me."
"Nothing thoughtful about her words. It's just the normal feminist claptrap where the woman is always the victim and the man always the oppressor. Everything does not have to be 50/50 and I really don't think so feels as strongly about the thousands of qualified men Wrighty might be blocking from a job than she is about the five or ten women.

As usual, the argument comes down to: a woman should get the job just because she is a woman. A ridiculous argument.  Ian Wright does not have to do any of those things she is demanding. Ian Wright is a better person than she is and a better advocate for the women's game."
The user to whom you are replying never suggested there shouldn’t be women in the men’s game.
"Yeah but go after the men that are actively keeping them down then, Ian has more than earned the right to take on media roles in the Women's side of football considering how much of a staunch advocate he has been for them."
"The point is there has been a very obvious and a strong push to include female pundits in the men’s game during the last 4-5 years. At least in England.

Almost every show on Sky Sports, BBC has a female pundit. One example being Kate Abdo. 

So, it’s kinda dishonest on her part to claim that there are not comparable opportunities for women pundits in men’s football. Or just not intelligent"

Ah, you've played yourself here mate."

"Mental health, pressure from the Joey Barton case, taken time to learn and will be a better person, requests time for her and her family to be left alone, will come back stronger and better - some hashtag about strength.

Here comes the autism diagnosis
And a complete loser
We all know Eni was wrong and Ian was not the one to attack like that. It can be a teaching moment. He just clearly still hurt.
That’s the impossible challenge for her
"> His name was brought up specifically in a negative light

Not by Eni Aluko, mind."
"> what she said was 100% a disingenuous ""play"" by her.

Have you [listened to the interview (~38 minutes in)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m002b6w7)? 

It doesn't strike me as a play at all: Eni Aluko isn't the one bringing up Ian Wright's name, and she makes a perfectly valid point about the lack of opportunities in the women's game - it's just poorly framed."
I didn't say he needed to. I said he should be the big man here and just accept it and know that everyone would see that generosity. It's a win for him. Not her.
"He’s saying that if it were white people there would be no issue. 

Basically he’s trying to make it about racism."
"So he’s not actually done anything? No grassroot funding, coaching academy or donated anything?"
"One is white. The other is black. If we then look at the human aspect, Wright is class, while Barton is a knobhead. 

Mixing them up is not a possibility lmao"
Blocks opportunities for hobos and the unkempt from flourishing in the media game. Lowlife fella is our Wrighty!

"Original, and IIRC the majority of items in the BM are English"
"People can be intellectually capable and also total idiots when it comes to decision-making and interacting with other people. 


It's like how Lukaku can fluently speak seven languages, but seems to make the worst decisions possible whenever it comes to using any of those languages to speak publicly. "
"think she's more dangerous/trouble to deal with , causing hassle"
"I don't know enough about Eni to render an opinion, but as an American who has to deal with a lot of grifters, most of them a very smart people who say incredibly stupid shit because it makes them lots of money. Texas senator and Zodiac killer Ted Cruz is by far the worst example of this."
I mean tbh this isn't really something she needs to feel super guilty over
Fara Williams exudes a love for football so strong that everyone should hope to find that much joy in *anything*. Nobody bats an eye when Karen Carney is there. Same with Steph Houghton. It's not a general woman issue like Eni would wish to make out.
She gets jobs because she causes controversy and controversy gets attention.
I get the impression from what he said that his lack of acceptance is more to do with the part where he says he’s supported her and helped her behind closed doors and stuff. If I backed someone and they turned around like this on me you bet I’m not accepting their apology either.
"She’s not a good broadcaster either, which is the worst part."
">Absolute cheek of it, when she's constantly on punditry during the men's game.

Don't agree with her criticism of Wright at all obviously all but her point was exactly that, there are loads of opportunities for men to do punditry in the men's game. She is not limiting mens opportunities. Women get a token spot in the men's game and she wrongly thinks that because of the limited air time for women in punditry in football, and especially the very limited punditry in  women's football, that Ians presence in that sphere is taking the spot away from a woman.

But she is completely ignoring the good Ian has done for women's football, he is a champion of it.

Her criticism/argument would be more valid if she had picked any man that regularly appears on women's football broadcasts through his standing in the men's game without being a proponent of the women's game. (if there is such a person, I have no idea. But Ian Wright is not the one deserving of criticism)"
"I don't think you can separate the two points tbh.

Once Ian Wright was brought up she had to steer away from the whole conversation, maybe if she talked about it more generally it wouldn't have got as much attention but I don't think it would be any better because the point would remain. The men talking on women's football are by and large there for a reason. If an arsenal women's player ever said explicitly or implicitly Vik Akers couldn't speak about women's football they would rightly be considered mad. Much like aluko is.

Thats notwithstanding a lot of it is because people don't like her. A lot of the people attacking her would be the same people criticising wright before the women's euros"
"She claims she has no opportunity to dominate male football punditry.  She does, she just isn't very charming.

Look at say Jermaine Jenas, was everywhere for a while but he's bland as fuck and now he's not.

Same as her.

Why does Wrighty get more of an opportunity than her? Because even people who don't like football know him."
"Just gave this a listen and find her argument slightly incoherent, as at recent women's tournaments there were hardly any men on broadcast bar Ian Wright. It's a bit damned if you do, damned if you don't - supporting the women's game, becomes 'dominating' it - but the converse would be showing a lack of support. I found her comments in bad fath."
I thought I agreed with this position when I first read the comments yesterday. Having listened to it and I actually think she digs herself a deeper hole as time goes on.
"An important addition to point 1 is not only does he bring more exposure, but he does it with such a high level of enthusiasm. Whenever he's covering the Lionesses you can tell he's actually a big fan, he's not just there for the money."
She’s suggesting he should wind back his broadcasting because he’s blocking female broadcasters. It’s definitely naturally read as a criticism.
"Basically no internet drama is as bad as people make it out to be. I’m also pretty sure she was specifically asked about Ian Wright, it’s not like she just threw his name out there as the premier issue with the women’s game right now. But it’s very easy to take it out of context and make it seem like she hates him."
"She's not gone after him though - his name was brought up by the interviewer initially, and Aluko pointed out the fact that there's very few opportunities in the women's game because it's still so small, and that it's important to be conscious of the effect of being a man in that space has. 

Like I reckon he even agrees with that point to some extent, given he explicitly mentions men massively hampering the women's game and it being about the collective: Can't have a collective approach if the people involved aren't self-aware."
"I don't want revenge at all - I simply think that it's the right thing to do to at least make an effort to right historical injustices. You know, like Ian Wright does by championing the women's game."
"> The point is there has been a very obvious and a strong push to include female pundits in the men’s game during the last 4-5 years. At least in England.

And that's great. It's a male-dominated space opening up to women, and that should be celebrated.

But she's pointing out the other side of the coin: Football and media are male-dominated spaces, and women's football and its broadcasting are a subset of those male-dominated spaces - and it's important to be conscious of that. 

When half of the WSL's managers are male but none of the 92 PL/EFL's are female then surely there's a barrier somewhere making it incredibly hard for women to work in the men's game in ways it simply isn't for men in the women's game. Punditry is further ahead in that regard, but just like every male manager in the women's game taking up space that could go toward women in the field, so do they in punditry. And she's simply pointing out that it's an important consideration when it comes to the growth of the women's game: There's no obvious answer, but I reckon at least keeping those general imbalances removed from any one specific person in mind is important, because how else do you make sure there's an equitable way for women to succeed in covering the game?"
Didn't know she'd hired the same PR agency as Gregg Wallace. 
She specifically mentions Ian when making the point. 40:30 I listened twice to make sure.
Which parts are valid? Genuine question
What a weird thing to do… I would have thought the issue of gender bias might be enough :)
Yeah he has aswell. He created the Ian wright coaching fund to increase the number of female coaches at grassroots level and paid for female coaches to attend their courses
https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/ex-arsenal-star-ian-wright-quietly-funds-womens-soccer-players-acl-rehab-after-stoke-city-failed-to-pay/
"It was widely reported this week he's been paying £1,700 a month in medical rehab over a number of months for a female stoke player who was abandoned by her club after a major long term injury."
He paid for a female pros ACL surgery recently
Untrue. He does a podcast with Rooney & Keane :)
Bloody Norman museum taking the relics of the colonised Angles and Romano-British. Disgusting. 
"They are, but people are apparently allergic to any semblance of research. Took me 10 seconds."
"The majority of the stuff in their collection sure, but if you've ever been there the stuff they have on display and that people go to see is from Egypt, Greece, Rome, ancient Mesopotamia, Classical Asia,  the Americas etc. They have like 50 items based off of the rosetta stone in all their gift shops, they would be hurting if they had to give that up lol."
"> People can be intellectually capable and also total idiots when it comes to decision-making and interacting with other people. 

That's wonderful.

She's not intellectually capable.

She can't get her words out on TV most of the time. Sometimes she gets things factually wrong.

""19 goals in 40 appearances, that's one a game"". 

""Arteta rung up Guardiola to help Arsenal buy Rice""."
Feel free to prove me wrong but I’ve never seen a single instance of her being targeted specifically with comments about her race and gender? Every criticism I’ve seen is simply about her being generally shite at punditry and making ridiculous statements.
"Jill Scott on the overlap as well.

It’s actually hilarious how bad Aluko has been because the first wave of female pundits will likely have jobs set up for the next 15 years, making more than they did as players.

All she needed to do was not be shit but she constant says stupid shit and now has decided to go after not just one of the most loved pundits there is, but the one former male footballer that has championed women’s football the most in the UK."
"I enjoy Karen Carney and not just because she played for Birmingham, but because she just gives good analysis and then leaves it. I don't think she's particularly there for her personality and she doesn't try and force one. She's on, she gets asked questions about football, she answers questions about football and gives insight. Done"
Who the fuck cares about anything Eni Aluko does or says normally lol? We care about Ian Wright. Just needs binned.
Let’s be completely honest if she was white she would be nowhere near the telly
"Yeah spot on I reckon. I honestly thought he'd try and defend her a bit, or wave it off. He knows what it's like to be a black footballer and pundit in the UK, and he knows more than any other male pundit or player about how much stick womens footballers get from blokes who hate it. For him to specifically state he rejects her apology like that says to me that there's more too this than just some thoughtless remarks from someone who is clearly prone to them. I think she must have really wronged him for him to say that."
People always say the worst part is the hypocrisy. 
"I wouldn’t say Jenas is the best example considering he lost a lot of his work because he was reported for inappropriate behaviour, not necessarily because he was a bad presenter."
"Karen Carney seems to do alright in the men’s game, but she’s good at what she does.  Eluko isn’t."
And why do they know him? Because he's been a big deal in men's football - something no female pundit could possibly achieve.
"> It's a bit damned if you do, damned if you don't - supporting the women's game, becomes 'dominating' it - but the converse would be showing a lack of support.

That's kinda the crux of it all, yeah - just need to find a way for people to work together to the benefit of everyone like Ian Wright proposes while being mindful of the distribution and the effects like Eni Aluko mentions. Just gotta have people be open to the discourse to figure it out really, and I reckon what the media made of this isn't particularly helping."
"Yet demanding more roles not based on merit, but based on sex.  All of this should be based on merit."
"And from a club side he gets HYPED for the Arsenal women's team, almost if not equally as much as the men's team. The man loves all football and going after him is quite possibly the dumbest thing she could've said."
The way to fix it is to give positions based on merit.. to both female and males. None of this making up for 60 years by favouring someone over someone else based on their sex.
"You do realise that it's the interviewer saying ""I'm thinking about Ian Wright"", yeah?"
"I reckon both the whole ""be conscious of the space you take up"" idea when it comes to being a man involved in women's football with regards to how small the game is and how few opportunities there are, as well as the ""there's a one-sided barrier"" talking about men managing in the WSL and no women managing in the PL/EFL are perfectly salient points. 

Like we can obviously talk about them and see if we actually agree with them or explore our disagreements, but in my book they're perfectly legitimate viewpoints really."
"That’s really good, I had no idea."
That’s a really nice thing to do.
"I know just read the story someone else linked. Really decent thing to do of him, I had no idea."
I just read that. He’s doing some good. He’s always come across as a decent guy
And helps them dress better to boot 😂
"Also museums the world over, including a majority of museums in Europe, all has 'ethically acquired' treasures and curiosities, yet somehow only the BM gets flak for it.

People do realise the British weren't the only major colonizing power at the time, yes? Half of Africa speaks French and the Americas speak Spanish for a reason. Failing to realise that is ironically perpetuating the Anglo supremacy that British colonialists were keen on."
"Show us your research then please. I just spent 4 hours wandering around it today and [as you can see on the map ](https://www.britishmuseum.org/sites/default/files/2024-07/British_Museum_map.pdf)there are like 5 rooms with stuff from Britain on display, the other 50ish were from Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, ancient Egypt, the americas, Assyria, Mesopotamia, the Levant and Middle East, East Asia, and elsewhere in Europe."
It was a joke lads….
British so-called people when the joke is about them:
">""19 goals in 40 appearances, that's one a game"".

I love it when that clip pops up every now and then"
Love Jill. She was a bit meh/nervous when she started at The Overlap but she quickly became more comfortable and stand on her own. Also helps that Keane and Wrighty are always so supportive of her. Wrighty deserves special mention because he always gives Jill props etc whenever they see each other. Super cool sibling relationship the all have.
"It's role models isn't it, both on and off the pitch. I'm in Notts, I can't stress how big an inspiration Mary Earps continues to be for my wife's team despite not seeing her as much. I don't think I'll get a good answer if I go round on Tuesday and ask how Eni inspired them this week."
Says stupid stuff for soundbytes online - probably the bosses know she's dense and gets people talking on X/here/facebook etc
Based on what exactly?
"Yes, that good ol’ Black privilege at work. Man GTFOH"
"this isn't twitter lad, get that shit outta here"
"Uh no, not how that works in 2025 atall. You can condemn her without this kind of rhetoric."
"You know, before I was thinking this is just a not very significant exchange, but your comment makes me think more a bit. That definitely seems worse"
It reminds me of that tragedy
I think it was the raping
"Tbf there‘s live footage of Jamie Carragher spitting on someone and he‘s still one of the most sought after pundits because, well… he‘s good. With Jenas it feels like everyone was glad they found a reason for him to be moved on"
"Oh didn't realise that, just picked the blandest, shitest pundit I could think of :-)"
"Because he's a great person and he's charismatic as fuck, being good isn't enough to become what Wrighty is nowadays"
"wtf are you talking about, there's many female reporters who covers male football"
Because women's football isn't popular.
"Yeah, Aluko has become a bit of a lightning rod for some pretty bad abuse. I'm not her biggest fan I have to say, but what Joey Barton did was disgusting and really instigated a pile on. 

I'm not sure I agree fully with her argument either, there are seats at the table in football for women. There are more women than ever as presenters, pundits and commentators. Definitely not as many as men, but it's normal that former players for teams will feature more so."
"What's merit, then?"
"> A pure soul like Ian Wright championing the game

Surely that's also taking revenge by your standards. 

> You can't champion having women covering the mens game and then criticise a a good man for covering the women's game

I'm not criticising Ian Wright at all. I'm simply pointing out that he's making an effort he doesn't need to make to champion the women's game at every opportunity - and I think it's the right thing to do.

> We're either trying to make progress or we're stuck in the past,

And that progress looks like Ian Wright, yes: Men actively working against sexist attitudes other men inhibit."
What does that merit look like?
"Yes, the interviewer brings Ian Wright up, and asks Eni a question specifically about Ian with regards to men in the women's game. And Eni replies, specifically talking about Ian. I mean, they are speaking plain English. I don't know how else to explain it to you."
"I feel like you're not really conscious of how much Ian Wright has done for the game and specifically women's football, or you have an agenda/biases you're trying to push?

Any space he does take up is an absolute positive for the women's game, and the WSL would not be in a better position without him. So is it better in your opinion to have exclusively females involved? Remove the male pundits and male coaches for opportunity sake for women?

Is the point to make women's football the best it can possibly be, or is it just meant to give females exclusive opportunities i.e. participation 'awards'? 

To exclude men (especially when they have as much experience and positivity as Ian does) and hope for the former is misguided."
"Thanks for the reply. 

I think they are reasonable points to make but don’t agree with them as they ignore some pretty important facts. 

The women’s game in the UK is financially propped up by the men’s game. I’m not saying this is a bad thing but if men participating in areas of the women’s game is an issue then it’s pretty hypocritical. The artificial sponsorship of women’s football also creates questions around meritocracy, the product is nowhere near the level of quality of lower league men’s football but receives an over proportional level of coverage. The arguments made Aluko smack of having her cake and eating it too. 

The lack of female managers in men’s football is an interesting one, and hopefully the floodgates will open after someone makes the first breakthrough. 

However the biggest part of this backlash is really down to Aluko’s own performance as a pundit. She lacks charisma, is a poor speaker, and struggles to articulate any real insights. Irrespective of her gender, she isn’t well liked due to her lack of ability . Fans really don’t want to hear her comments about women being held back when she obviously has very little talent but has clearly benefited over others (male and female) far more deserving than her."
Nah it’s all good. Also check his granddaughter (SWP’s daughter) who could be one for the future
Clearly.......
I don't think it's true that only the British Museum gets flak for it's collection and there's been ton of post-colonial pushback and discourse against other colonizing powers. Saying things like this just reveals a lack of research and study on your part.
"No need to get butthurt about criticism of colonialism.

It’s an English speaking website, there are bound to be more people on here who were colonised by the British than the Spanish, French or Dutch"
"Because she is dogshit in every facet of being a pundit

she isn’t even a Rio or Owen who is shit but at least had an excellent playing career that maybe gives them some credit in the bank

Can’t really think of any possible other reason she consistently gets tv gigs other than the token thing. As sad as that is to say I’m just saying it like it is"
"What do you think the reason she got on the telly is then genuinely? 

Her insight? Clearly not

A stellar playing career? Clearly not

Good and polished tv persona? Clearly not

Please enlighten me id genuinely love to hear the reason that im wrong"
"Why do you think Aluko consistently get on telly as a pundit then? I’d genuinely like to know what you think. She constantly gets jobs whilst being hilariously incompetent, and does not even have a stellar playing career as an excuse like some sub par pundits do (Rio, Owen etc)

What does she offer that other women pundits do not?"
"How does it work then enlighten me

What are the main reasons aluko has made it as a pundit in your opinion"
What a sensible comment about reading something changing your mind. I can’t say I’ve ever read anything quite like this on reddit lmao
What a name for an airline!
And Roy Keane happily admitted to trying to break a players leg with a horror tackle. He’s still paid a shit load by Sky every year.
Fair enough haha
"Would you ascribe those things to, dunno, Gary Neville or Rio Ferdinand too?"
"Aye, and why isn't it popular? Because it's been banned for half a century - something Ian Wright points out in this video, and something he recognises as a historical injustice to work against."
"> but it's normal that former players for teams will feature more so.

Suppose so, but then we've kind of got the inverse in the women's game - half of the WSL's managers are men despite never having played the women's game, and media and punditry are fundamentally structured around men in charge as well. And that's ultimately where that whole meritocracy argument doesn't pass muster for me: can't have meritocracy when there's a massive inequity of opportunity.

Like dunno, big picture I reckon she's making points that at least should be heard and explored, regardless of whether she's a good pundit or not. Perfectly fine to disagree with them, but we'd all be better off listening more to each other and understand where we're coming from, rather than having this silly media spat that benefits nobody."
"What do you mean what’s merit lol, you can work that one out for yourself.  It’s not being born with a vagina or testicles."
Uh. Being good at your job for starts? Lmfao?
"Ok, you do you."
Scott’s fine - Eni god no - probably only there as she gets sound bytes online
"We get it, you fucking love being a contrarian arsehole. Stop it now. You're not making anything better for anyone."
You can read my response to the other place you asked it.
"> The women’s game in the UK is financially propped up by the men’s game.

Sure, but then the men's game also had a 50+ year advantage in growth over the women's game, seeing how men banned women from playing football. And that's where the meritocracy argument falls apart for me to be honest: meritocracy can work when everyone has an equal starting position and equal advantages, but that's not the world we created for ourselves. And it's hardly like men's football is particularly meritocratic either: The more money a club has the likelier it is for them to be successful, the more well-known you were as a player the likelier you end up as a pundit.

> However the biggest part of this backlash is really down to Aluko’s own performance as a pundit. She lacks charisma, is a poor speaker, and struggles to articulate any real insights. Irrespective of her gender, she isn’t well liked due to her lack of ability . Fans really don’t want to hear her comments about women being held back when she obviously has very little talent but has clearly benefited over others (male and female) far more deserving than her.

I don't have an opinion on her punditry one way or another to be honest - I've simply seen too little of it. But let's be real here: would people take equal offense if it was Rio Ferdinand or Robbie Savage or Ian Wright making those points? I genuinely don't think so. Sure, she might be regarded as a poor pundit, but the backlash isn't taking on this proportion because of that. The Daily Mail and the Telegraph aren't making a big deal out of this because she's a poor pundit, they're making a big deal out of this because she dares to be a black woman in a predominantly white and male space. It's a nice opportunity for a little anti-women punching down for them, and plenty people happily lap that up. It's not about discussing and exploring whether there's something to what she *says*, and all about *who she is*. And that's to the detriment of everyone, including (us?) men. 

And even if she's a poor pundit who people dislike - does that mean she can't still make a good point about this?"
"None that's been memed to death the world over though? I'm also on Indonesian and partially on Spanish-language internet and any 'museum theft' jokes have all been the British Museum. I know Brazilian internet memes about Portuguese-stolen gold but that's about it that I've seen.

Hell, the Dutch government returned a bunch of artefacts that were taken during colonialisation and all over Indonesian internet the jokes were *still* about the British Museum.

I'm in no way defending their practices but can't help but feel that not only is the joke overdone, it also helps to deflect the conversation away from the others by giving the issue an easy target, to the point that there are people genuinely blaming the British Museum for artefacts that were taken by and kept in museums in other countries."
"> Because she is dogshit in every facet of being a pundit

Don’t disagree

> she isn’t even a Rio or Owen who is shit but at least had an excellent playing career that maybe gives them some credit in the bank

Yeah 3 world cups 2 euros 1 olympics in over 100 appearances for England is mid as fuck, what an absolute nobody, totally irrelevant  
Not saying she’s the female messi but come on…

> I’m just saying it like it is

Ah ok"
"Largely because she played woman’s football and very definitely knows far more about it than me or you.

Acting like the sole reason she got the job is because of her skin color is rather incorrect."
"Well, it happens on issues you don't feel super strongly about lol. I suppose most others who felt that way just upvoted and moved on. But thank you, that's a very nice thing to say"
That's for the Da's they love that stuff. Reminds them of the good old days of the The Big Match.
That ban was wrong but it was also lifted more than 50 years ago so plenty of time to build a fan base.
"Yeah agree with all your points. I'm not sure why men who haven't played are being put in charge at WSL clubs? The coverage I've seen of women's football doesn't seem to be male dominated though, or is that wrong? Whenever I've watched Women's football in tournaments I've found the presenting and punditry to be predominantly female led. 

The big discrepancy is how men's football get's broadcast much more, that will take a long time to change."
"Sure, but like by what standard? Can women not be equally good football pundits compared to men - and if not, why? 

Like obviously meritocracy is a really good idea: We all want people who are good at what they do to be put in positions to influence and excel. But that's hardly the reality we live in - being good at what you do is important, but it's nowhere near enough to rise to the top: got to have the right background, the right face, the right gender, the right skin colour, the right education, the right contacts, the right accent to be given a look in. 

And that's why I reckon meritocracy is often being used in a strange way: Phil Neville might well be a good football manager, but he's been appointed Lionesses manager despite having no previous senior managerial experience, nevermind experience in the women's game. But do you ever see the people championing the vague idea of meritocracy point that out as an absolute failure of meritocracy?

It's cool that we as men can talk about sexism and explore the ways in which it hinders us as a society. But big picture, I reckon most of the time someone brings up meritocracy it's little more than a fig leaf to protect the status quo - an easy out of saying ""she's not good enough"" when she's every bit as good as her male counterparts despite having the deck historically stacked against her. And that's why I'm always a bit on edge when someone tries to make the meritocracy argument without actually defining what they believe meritocracy to be."
"Genuinely not about being contrarian, just interested in what merit looks like for people when what we're discussing ultimately boils down to sexism - because I reckon if we were truly basing things on merit we'd be close enough to an even gender split and have actually good pundits."
"Yeh good post. In short I don’t think the advantage men’s football has over women’s is anything to do with time. It’s a biological advantage that won’t be overcome. A meritocracy that saw gender equality would suggest that both genders are capable of the same quality of product and this is fundamentally not the case. I do I agree more generally with your points though on wider more important areas of equality. 

I also don’t agree with your view that this has much to do with her race or gender. Now there are definitely some idiots that will jump on this for those reasons, but it’s disingenuous to ignore Aluko’s lack of ability. She is a beneficiary of the system she chooses to criticise. People see this and it drives them to respond to her comments. It’s not about race, it’s blatant hypocrisy. As for being anti-women, I disagree again. There are plenty of good female sports pundits, in fact I’d argue that those in Cricket are absolutely stellar. Now if they were to make the same points about being held back by male representation I would listen up. Unfortunately Aluko isn’t a talented broadcaster and it’s far more probable that lack of opportunities she sees is down to her limitations over innate prejudice."
"You've never seen jokes or memes about America stealing land from other countries, or any general comments about American imperialism? Because that is certainly huge particularly in minority and leftist online communities. I have certainly seen stuff about all colonizing countries, not just specifically Britain and the British Museum. Like I just googled ""colonizer museum theft"" and [this](https://www.vice.com/en/article/moma-new-york-closing-inclusion/) was the first article I found, about the MoMA in New York. I'm sure there's loads more. 

Also your comment about people failing to realize the existence of other colonizing powers is particularly interesting on a footy subreddit, given things such as the whole Argentina - France chant debacle. Like I said, I think there's plenty of conversation, memes, analysis, etc around ALL the colonizing powers, one just has to look even a little hard for it. Memes about Americans stealing oil, ""shut up colonizer"" is a joke applied to everyone from Canada to Belgium, Black Panther 1 and 2 had commentary about British, American, and Spanish colonization, I could go on."
"When how many appearences you’ve made are your biggest achievement, that really just means you don’t have achievements.

Again I’ll ask you, like I’ve asked everyone else who’s disagreed(but nobody will answer strangely) , why do you personally think Aluko has got so much telly work despite being unknowledgeable, uninteresting and unlikeable."
"Lots of other women also played women’s football and know a lot about it. 

Why do you think she got jobs and those other women didnt?"
"Women can of course be equally as good pundits as men, I don't think anyone disputes that. They have the same capability to watch the game and understand it as us, thus they should be able to communicate it to a viewer.

Meritocracy is one's ability to communicate and articulate yourself well about football. Is it a perfect system? Of course not, there's probably a bloke out there who could be the best electrician in the world and he's stuck doing repairs for your nan and not NASA or whatever. Does that mean we should abandon the concept altogether? Probably not.

Eni Aluko, for all it's worth? Not a very good pundit. She comes across as clueless about a lot of things. Not helped by her clippable soundbytes where she says the most utterly ridiculous things.


I believe in giving people who are demonstrably good at their job the shout, has Eni Aluko proven for you that she's in the top 10 maybe pundits? It's not even close for me. 

RE: Phil Neville, that's weird I agree. He might be ""good enough"" and thus an acceptable appointment but with no experience with the ladies I'd find it weird.

It's an easy way out to say she's not good enough... because she isnt."
Probably first time seeing someone think Eni is actually good at her job - strange things happen
Gender split is irrelevant to merit.
"> A meritocracy that saw gender equality would suggest that both genders are capable of the same quality of product and this is fundamentally not the case.

Dunno, see it in tennis - it's slightly different because of the physical capabilities, but then people seem to enjoy them pretty equally anyway. Get quite a few sports at the Olympics that seem to be pretty equally popular, too.

> There are plenty of good female sports pundits, in fact I’d argue that those in Cricket are absolutely stellar. Now if they were to make the same points about being held back by male representation I would listen up.

Right, but that's kind of what I'm getting at here. The way I read Aluko's point (and it may well be off-mark!) isn't that she's bemoaning that she specifically has been held back by a sexist system in women's football, but rather that the wider setup isn't affording the same opportunities to women than it is to men. And I reckon she doesn't need to be a great broadcaster or pundit to point that out."
"And yet the default for 'colonizer museum theft' is still the British Museum. I think you're conflating my point about making an overused joke that isn't even remotely accurate to a point about colonisation or colonisation jokes in general.

Nobody makes a similar comment about someone stolen artwork on someone saying 'Hang it up in the Louvre' regarding something beautiful done by a Frenchman (like an Mbappe wondergoal, for instance). Nobody makes snarky 'all the displays are stolen' comments about visiting the Amsterdam Rijksmuseum, or at the very least will be downvoted or seen as a party pooper/someone being negative for the sake of being negative. Yet anything that mentions the British Museum in any way always invites the comments and people circlejerking themselves over it, including the very one that sparked this conversation to begin with. They're even made by other Europeans whose very countries are complicit themselves.

That's what I mean by it being overdone. Either treat every single one of them the same way without having to 'look even a little hard for it' as you put it, or just let the damn joke die due to how overused it is. The British aren't special."
"Various reasons that only the people who hired her know about.

Did Ian Wright get his punditry job because of his skin color or his knowledge about football? Which do you thinks more likely huh?"
"See, I appreciate your comment, because I've got you pegged as a good egg, and we can actually have a reasonable discussion about the stuff at hand here even if we don't agree with each other.

I don't really know much about Aluko's punditry, and I don't particularly care about her. It's more about a wider view for me, removed from the personalities involved, the structural side if you will: I know what football punditry/football media/this entire space of football fandom is like from a male perspective. But that's the default we've always had, a male-dominated environment, so I'm genuinely interested in what female voices are saying about it - and in this case I reckon Aluko's making good points that are (accidentally, carelessly or intentionally) poorly framed. What *does* it mean for women when half the WLS's managers are men when none of the 92 PL/EFL managers are men? What *does* it mean for women in football when men don't consider the space they're taking up in the small niche that is the women's game?

And that's where meritocracy comes into it, I reckon. Even assuming it was just about being the best possible pundit you could be (which, let's be real, it absolutely isn't), what does it mean when women get far fewer opportunities to hone their skills and build a career in that space? How can we have a meritocracy when people have very uneven chances to succeed in the first place? And if we want to create a meritocracy, shouldn't we consider all these intersectional factors and help pave the way for the best to shine?

Like yeah, maybe Eni Aluko isn't good enough as a pundit - I wouldn't know, because I've not seen enough of her on TV. But I don't think that changes much about the wider point, about the structural issues she brings up. Because if we're honest here we can probably call Rio Ferdinand a poor pundit as well, and yet he's not going to be replaced anytime soon for someone better.

I don't think there's any easy solutions on this, but I reckon it's valuable to have conversations with women about these male-dominated spaces. As you say, there's no reason women are inherently worse pundits than men, so exploring all the factors that play into the big picture and giving women the time and space to voice their opinions is beneficial for everyone I reckon - we'll all learn something, and we might well end up with better pundits if we allow quality to bubble up to the top more than we do now. Even if that leaves Eni Aluko behind.

Like dunno, I feel quite strongly about equality, but then I'm also probably prone to just not having the right audience for what's ultimately a high-concept discussion, and this thread is a good example."
Half of the population of this planet we share are women. Stands to reason that if we're handing out positions on merit that we'll end up with an even split - because there's hardly going to be a genetic advantage either way in football broadcasting.
"It’s not really true about Tennis though. The women’s game doesn’t pull the same revenue as the men’s and is undeniably a much lower level of quality. Equal prize money in Tennis majors really isn’t the great progressive move it’s claimed to be.  Women essentially earn the same money as the men for playing less and playing worse. Now is it still good to watch, yep it is.

Absolutely Aluko is entitled to make her point, just as others are entitled to call out her hypocrisy even if she’s making general commentary. It’s a question of credibility, and in the public’s eye she doesn’t have any. If she was a brilliant broadcaster, someone like Isa Guha, then the response would be very different.

Also it’s fair of people to question Aluko’s judgement somewhat. It would’ve been easy to make the same point without bringing Ian Wright into the situation. She’s just made things difficult for herself."

no way he did it again 😭
He said it with respect.
Jude has become incredibly unlikeable this season with how whiny he can be.
I for one am just happy to see all the Barca vs Real drama back. Its been so boring for like 7/8 years now
All of them absolutely lost it.
"He deserves a 7 game ban in my honest, completely unbiased opinion. He obviously hasn't learned his lesson."
"Was Bellingham always like this in Dortmund?

He’s become unhinged tbh is season"
"what possible play was this that generated a response like this from him? genuinely can't remember much and him also saying 'every 50/50 is against us' is just wild after this match,generational headloss."
Real Madrid are such crybabies
Did he say thank you even once?
Imagine if they put this much passion into scoring
This guy whines about everything
Entitled piece of s*it
you guys don't understand. it was a private joke between friends. nothing but respect for the referees that night.
"It’s ok, it’s just respectful banter between mates. Nothing to see here!"
Tbh it would have been real easy to just STFU and focus on the match rather than risk being sanctioned but that’s just me
"While his reaction is not justified, he gave us a lot of trouble in the second half. It's only natural to feel 'things are not going my way' after this. But yes, he has a very unlikable attitude - which I don't think he had in Dortmund."
"Unpopular comment incoming. 

I do not think dude is the world-class top 5 player in the world they make him out to be this season and often gaslight you with the ""but he is playing a different position"" take. I have seen Declan Rice school him in their two legs against Arsenal and yes, while he was brilliant in the second half against Barca, his laziness and antics in the first half led to the Pedri goal.

Then, he gets away with way too many fouls when playing defense, the same fouls that would have a lot of other players carded."
"This has clearly become a problem of sufficient magnitude that it's bringing the sport into disrepute. Therefore the sorts of bans we've seen for Toney and Tonali need to be handed out. It's a different problem but with the same effects, so it needs the same punishment."
Rude Bellend-ham
The entitlement on this man-child is insane
"Tbf, saying ""fuck off"" to a ref in England is very common."
"Any other player would’ve received a ban for several games. But as you can see, this player is wearing white. The most that will happen is a verbal talk not to do this again …because you know … this hasn’t happened ever lol"
"Ban these bastards for the rest of the season. All of the whiners - Vini, Bellingham, Rodrygo and Rudiger."
He really is such a petulant child
"More evidence of ""both sides"" losing it u/sensitiveCube"
Roy Keane's classic calling Andy Robertson a baby seems appropriate for this behaviour
Real Madrid are speedrunning Bellinghams reputation into the ground. His blue nose is coming out
He’s turned in to a right princess haha
"I can see why he went to Real instead of Liverpool.

He's got that Real energy."
He’s such a prick.
RM player says “fuck off”. /soccer is in shambles. How dare he. What a bunch of angels y’all players are
Dude thought he's Raphinha lol
A footballer cussing??? Holy FUCK. Joke of a club.
Let’s hope he escapes punishment like Raphinha
Pretty sure this is the 3rd or 4th time it's been on video
"He most certainly did. He was also screaming about every 50/50 decision going against Real as he walked back down the tunnelc ~~after the match finished~~ at half time.

Third red card in fifteen months for the same thing."
"Tbf, last time he said ""Fuck you"" which is a bit worse."
He’s a fucking baby
An inside joke gesture towards some close friends who were at the game. Nothing but respect for how refs officiated tonight.
"He was classy about it. La Real is different, you wouldn't understand."
"He was awful v Arsenal. The club enables this whiny entitlement. So you get Rudiger throwing stuff at the ref, crazy."
"I think Dortmund fans found him really unlikeable for a while already. Him moping around, not celebrating with his teammates and not thanking the fans. He seems incredibly immature at times and has a bit of a temper. Combined with the lack of self reflection and the entitlement it makes for a childish guy prone to repeat his mistakes."
Embodying the bitchiness of being a madrid player lol
No lie Jude was the only bright spot on the Real Madrid team in the match. I was actually impressed. But his attitude is so shite I remembered why I don’t like him
He already had a massive ego at Dortmund. I think he was just less in the spotlight.
The game is gone when fans are feigning disgust at a player for telling a ref to fuck off.
"I notice he is super competitive, and I rather him be like that than him acting like he doesn't care."
"Yeah, I mean its not back back like prime el classico back where they look like they are about to murder each other.

But this one is better than the last few years."
"Love to see it. Haven't watched Spanish football in years and thought maybe Madrid is no longer a team of cunts now that Ramos, Pepe, Casemiro, Carvajal are gone. Nope, still the least likeable bunch of melts."
"Not gonna happen, he’s wearing white. I hope they have the guts to watch the two clear penalties that the Var referee was too afraid of calling the referee to take a second look at because his kids may get bullied by little madridista’s on the play ground"
"No, let them run him down."
I will settle for 2
Bro did you forget that he is a real Madrid player ?
"Whole club deserve a 7 game ban.    
This behaviour needs to be rooted out, we should be respecting the officials."
"I would be shocked if Rudiger got half that amount, let alone bellingham"
"What about Raphinha having a go at the AR and then 4th official in the same game?  That was all recorded too.  Not everything gets punished, and when Bellingham got a red earlier in the season, it was the center ref who gave it, not a post game suspension."
In Germany he directed most of his rage toward his own teammates
"Rudiger has also shifted into an extra gear of insanity, he was nutty at Chelsea, but not like this"
"Yup, but he's dialed it up a bit since joining Madrid and dialied it up a LOT this season"
He's also diving a whole lot more than his time at BVB
I may have been biased but I don’t remember him being this much of an arse
"This is a guy who has been treated like a king his whole life, a literal spoilt brat. Birmingham city retired his number 22 after only playing 41 games for them as a 16 year old. When you've been privileged your whole life, equality feels like oppression."
There were a lot of hard challenges that he was involved in in extra time. Im sure he felt aggrieved that none of them were called for him when some of them could have easily.
The ref must wear a RM suit !
Tbh Bellingham carried second half.
"Hes had a poor season imo compared to last year

Hes also really unhinged this season

The locker room has definitely shifted towards immaturity 

They need to get rid of Vinicious and balance the squad with other needs"
Top 5 in the world? no. World class? Yes. I noticed he is really committed on offense but really doesn’t give his all on defense. That plus his attitude are such a shame for such a gifted player
"He's a fantastic player with a very high ceiling who IMO has been used incorrectly by Carlo, been ran into the ground but also has his fair share of blame for how things have gone this season.

His first half of last season was the stuff of dreams from a PR perspective, with talk of him already justifying his price tag etc (which IMO just shows where we are at in football).

Any objection to that kind of stuff last season here would've seen you heavily downvoted. His luxury McTominay-esque contributions did mask some average performances at times but the train was already full-speed ahead. In the Clásico at Montjuïc, I distinctly remember Gavi in particular having a better overall game than him. But Jude left with the headlines because of that first great strike, and the fortunate winner.

And then when those contributions died down in the second half of the season, it was overshadowed by Vini grabbing the headlines for example.

He will never have *pausa* but he doesn't have to since he isn't that style of midfielder. His physical attributes for a midfielder are almost unmatched and most coaches would love a player like that. He's obviously very technically-capable too.

If he's used properly in his best role he can reach his potential. 

Do I think he's better than Pedri? Of course not. And that isn't an insult to Jude, nor is it bias from being a culer. Pedri is potentially GOAT-level IMO (and clearly that is no joke of a statement).

But that doesn't mean that he's suddenly some fraud now. As AJ-like as he is with his character, we will see based on who Madrid get how he can develop because his ceiling still remains **very high**."
"His tackling and overall defense is really quite bad, I think if he gets a red once and refs start to notice and look for it more he could become a liability tracking back. He does get targeted a lot himself, but it seems that he can't handle the frustration and only goes in harder."
What are you on about?
"And saying negro to a black guy is apparently common in many Latin countries.. (it’s not same thing I know, but difference in culture yadi yada)"
Wdym? He was literally the one who received a ban before for saying the same shit.
"What are you even talking about? He just came off a match ban for dissent. When do you think bans get handed out? Right along with the card? He has been sent off, we will need to wait how long his ban will be, but it will likely be higher since it is a repeat offense."
what did rodrygo do?
"This season is lost ban them for next season

Edit: ignore the flair"
"You’re losing it. It’s just a game, their success or failure doesn’t really affect you. I’ve seen Madrid fans today that showed dignity. Be like them. (And to this specific post, you’re acting like Bellingham doesn’t have a chronicled history of lashing out like a spoiled brat at referees, get over it)"
Dude knew he's joshing with his teammate lol
"Of course, it's just banter between teammates"
"You would think it might be in the context of every 50/50 ball where two players attempt to gain possession.

But knowing Bellingham it's absolutely about the referee."
"Was at half time, which is crazy because we deserved 2 pens in the first half"
Lock him up throw away the key.
Did he at least he say it respectfully?
La Real is Sociedad my dude
Average English person
"Jude is a childish player throwing temper tantrums, but Rüdiger is a huge cunt. The stuff he gets away with during and after games is insane."
He was madrids best player. He was doing all the CF work Mbappe was neglecting.
"Perfect for Madrid in all honesty. I can’t recall a game where they don’t whine. The old team were a bunch of crybabies too, but when the lose a close game like this or win, atleast they show respect to the opposing team. 

This new generation Madrid are so far up Perez’s ass kissing and licking they try to make their papa proud during the game and after."
"Yeah… language includes tone and context.  Oh fuck off man🙄, is quite different than FUCK OFF 🤬. It’s mainly the repeated specific warnings with him tho. "
That’s a false dichotomy. He could be professional
"Was he super competitive when he let Pedro run freely to score immediately after he stood still for 5 seconds after missing a pass?

All jokes aside, this is completely bullshit. It's the kind of take I expect from adults who throw temper tantrums in CoD ""because they're competitive""."
Gerard martin had a proper clasico tackle. And ofc rm were butchering barca with no cards as usual
"Im not sure we will ever get that tbh

The 2 greatest players of all time on each team and both in their prime 

2 legendary managers 

Could easily say the majority of players involved were legends on both teams"
Rudiger did try the murder bit
Peak footy. Cr7 and Messi. Plus Ramos ready to breaks everyone’s legs and get sent off.
Carvajal is still there. He’s just hurt.
"That won't save him. His and and Rudinger's season is over.

Anything remotely leniant, as I said in a different thread, and the refs will go on strike."
"Didn't Raphinha say to one of the referees, his mother's pussy or something like that.
Nothing happened then and he was not wearing white."
"Are you crazy, some of their fans are already talking like they got robbed. The fuck you mean the players reflect. Their club is about what Perez tells them to believe and act."
So no difference in Spain
"He was regularly dirty bordering on violent with Chelsea as well, his weird behaviour it just isn't limited to games anymore."
"He's not dealing well with the fact that he went from being the main player, getting all the accolades for his late winning goals, to being another passenger in this woeful Madrid team."
The Yadi Yada culture seems very racist to me. They must be a right bunch of twats.
And he did it again
So he didn't learn his lesson?
Rudiger's ban should 100% be long enough to carry into next season
Lmfao sounds like you’re the one losing it here
You've lost the plot
">It’s just a game, their success or failure doesn’t really affect you.

No shit man lmao, I'm fucking around because i got nothing better to do.

>I’ve seen Madrid fans today that showed dignity. Be like them

Eeh, that's boring. That wouldn't get these wonderful replies for me to reply to :)"
lol love it when Barca fans have zero argument on my statements
Thank you for the correction!
And to be up a man
It was an inside joke between friends
"madrid = real madrid

atleti = atletico madird

la real = real sociedad

for the non la liga watchers"
Thrown many bananas recently?
The games back… again.
"Messi and CR rivalry is so funny because their teammates hate each other, try to hurt each other. 

But they both chillin not giving what the media wants, 0 altercation between them.

In el classico rivalry, CR fights with everybody on Barca, except Messi. Messi fight with everybody on Real, except CR."
It wasn’t a clásico without a Ramos red
He's trying to emulate the ways of the 'biggest club in the world'
Nothing happened then because the ref didn't put it on his report. He didn't put it on his report because the linesman started that interaction yelling at raphinha
Don’t try to reason with him. They don’t do wrong. Complete angels I tell you
"But it went woeful due to only 1 additional, Mbappe?"
"I think there is just a bad culture atm.

He is too young to be the leader. They need someone older to calm him down and settle Jude

I used to be a huge defender of Vinicious but I believe the team should try to offload him to the Saudis

Madrid really needs Gyokeres, Wirtz, and a LB"
"Lol love it when fascists LOSE
(Waits for a reply with the number 15)"
"And Athletic Club is *not* called Athletic Bilbao. Also, Villarreal has two l's and two r's."
"True 

I guess it shows the respect between them"
"It's a bunch of kids in here I'm telling you. 
The downvotes whenever Raphinha is brought up is funny."
I would say a missing Kroos is a much bigger issue here.
"A non-Spaniard talking about “fascist history”. Let me guess, the Catalan propaganda has been feeding you? Ironic that you bring up HISTORY yet complain about Madrid fans bringing up the 15 CL. 

I don’t need to bring up irrelevant topics like CL, I’m not immature. The best team won, doesn’t change the fact that there’s double standards with these refs."
">And Athletic Club is *not* called Athletic Bilbao

Unless you want to annoy them, then Bilbao or ""Bilbado"" is the go to"
case in point😂
"I've lived in Spain since you were still a swimmer. 

You don't want to start with history dude.

Who's that mickey mouse commentator on Premier Sports claiming 100% penalty.
The commentators on premier sports are completely convinced that he’s swiped his legs out where as far as I can see their legs literally don’t touch at all right?
Of course the game ends like this. How could it not with the controversy in the build up to the game
"This one wasn't a penalty IMO, but the other two were clear ones"
"This one is not but he should have called the Ferran one

The ref is completely scared, he doesn't know what to do and Is letting the VAR ref for him, if the VAR calls he gives if not he doesn't"
"I'm not one to say a wrong decision needs to be fixed by another wrong decision, but he didn't give a clear penalty 1 minute before that, feels like it would only be fair since there was a shove from behind? why the fuck did this take 5 minutes in var and the other one 5 seconds?"
I thought it was a stonewall Pen. VAR really got it this time.
(great dive)
Correct decision
Actually the right decision imo but the one before this should've been given.
"This one would have been harsh but Rudiger (who should have seen several yellows) on Ferran was 100% a penalty, as were the fouls on Cubarsi and a clear handball to stop the ball reaching anyone at the second post. Referee got intimidated and it shows. Absolute clown show this."
Clear dive but r/soccer will r/soccer
Well well well
"Good call, wasn't a pen in a million year"
Nice that they got through that quickly and smoothly
so VAR can work here but not on the cubarsi pen? got it
Hits Raphinhas back leg with the knee of the back foot
"This was an excellent dive though, even had me fooled until the third replay"
"Not a single cut in which you can see contact, you can doubt other decisions this match but this one is on point"
"I don't know. It seems to me like Asensio's knee hits Raphinha's back leg, and he reacts/dives to that.

It's way less clear than the one they completely ignored 5 mins ago, tho."
"It's not a penalty, I don't know why people are crying here, jesus christ, just fucking take one look at it"
R/soccer should stop harassing the ref
"Embarrassing PremierSport commentator I'm listening to, making it out like it wasn't a dive lmao"
"We're getting 30 more mins of this madness, I feel blessed"
"What a shock, another call favoring Real Madrid!!!

The propaganda machine that is RMTV putting I'm extra work this week!!!

(Even if that wasn't actually a penalty)"
crying all week worked
VAR only looked into the penalty that actually wasn't. What about the previous 3??
LMAO DOESNT EVEN TOUCH HIM FUCK OFF
"ref is really good this game, you are all dumb fucks"
It's not a pen but Madrid got away with 2-3 penalties already
What the fuck
Actually a fantastic call by the ref.
What a dive
"Good call

Clear dive

Props to the ref for not falling for the typical
Barca complaining and surrounding refs"
"Great use of VAR, a perfectly timed dive,"
My god I would die for this level of competence in the pl
top dive from Raphinha
Madrid and their campaign before the game worked.
NAH THIS SHIT IS WRITTEN
"Yeah, live feed looked bad but replay clears it up, obviously not a pen, I’m not even sure there’s any actual contact, but Asensio is wrong for even attempting a challenge there."
Refs were never going to call this a pen. Real would’ve been at the press tomorrow saying “we were right about the refs”. Yet no VAR check for the other handballs in the box. Waiting until the 95th minute.
Madrid really scared the ref into having a chance in this match. Clear penalties and bookings avoided before this incident. Shameless club
"ref just has no balls, that's all"
How was the Ferran one not a pen?????
There was a clear penalty for Ferran! RM compaign worked.
"Dang, VAR finally managed to make a call but only to help Madrid"
Anyone has the the angle that clearly shows it's not?
he smacks him on the back
"I’m sorry I don’t see it 
Am I missing a dive? There’s definite contact with no touch of the ball 🤯 
Can someone help"
"I actually think the ref has handled the game relatively well despite the circumstances. He was calm in making the call, and calm on overturning this one. Hasn't let the pressure get to him or let the game get away from him"
Ironically if we wasn’t starting to dive he probably would have gotten fouled
Clear dive. Good decision
Cheating bastarda
embarrassing dive
These commentators man. There was 0 contact.
No fucking way
i get it’s soft and he embellished a little but you can’t just hit somebody in the back like that. not enough to overturn
actual Fallon d'or level dive by how good it is
Right decision here
I mean this was clearly a dive lol but people won’t admit it. The previous one not so much.
"Perfect call, that was a dive. And I dislike both teams lol"
Bullying works
No fallon dfloor nomination? If this was vini would be easy 10k upvotes nominee.
The angle shows it wasn’t
Not a pen but they should have got a pen before.
"This sub will cry, but that's an obvious dive"
actually robbed
Diving bastard
being robbed rn
So we can go to VAR for that but not the first one?
funny cause this is clearly not a pen but Rudiger on Ferran a minite ago was clearly a pen
"Thanks Flo, your payment went through. Ferran one should’ve been a pen"
The one penalty that clearly wasn’t is the one that gets reviewed
It’s a DISGRACE
RM should honestly get fined for their theatrics. This one is a bit iffy but the Fernan one is so painfully obvious
"Bitching all week about a ref works for Madrid. 

Who knew!!"
Turns out the pressure works
Look at the back foot. Not a dive
They never show all the angles to the ref at var
This might not be a pen but this is a robbery
Absolute cinema
I'm sure the conversation between the Barcelona and Real Madrid faniacs will be totally civil now
I literally thought there was no VAR for this match
Raphinha becoming vini 2.0 ..
"This would've been super soft, but, um, literally pulling him down from his back. The one against Ferran 100%, and this is a foul in the midfield."
Only for Madrid
VAR: video assistant real.
Fair decision but wanted to see Var when Cubarsi was getting shoved and Ferran was fouled. Not to mention Olmo getting steamrolled potentially in the box
"This is a clear dive, deserved yellow"
That was never a penalty in this lifetime.  Stupid dive from Scubaman when there was potential to finish the game with a legit goal.
The foul before by Rudiger on Ferran was likely a penalty. This was 💯% a dive! Very good dive I must say!
Feeling really bad for this referee's kid
"It was a dive, but the kids who bullied the ref's son must be feeling like dorks right now"
Pretty obvious dive in slow motion.
"Classic gaslighting, ignore the 2 obvious penalties then finally check the situation thats like 95% no penalty but looks controversial at first sight."
"Wait am I delusional? Saying this is a dive is insane, you can see the defender knee hits Raphinha trailing leg at roughly 37 second. Focus only on the trailing leg."
Big time dive by this subs balon dor winner
Ref is fucking bad. Should have called Rudiger's foul but didn't and then he called this a pen lmfao so bad.
Diving trashy Raphinha
"This one is a blatant dive, and Rafinha almost sold it as well"
"Ref/var have got all the calls right in the end, anyone crying about any of these being penalty’s is a jokeman, Barca diving around tryna steal the game"
"This English commentator I'm listening too is so dumb, he kept saying there was contact lmao"
Bluetooth pen
Varmadrid at it again. Didn’t look at the cubarsi and Torres foul but decided to intervene here lmaooo
clear dive.. but you should always check the other call
"Neutral so: I think it is 50-50. I think Asensio is being clumsy but I think Raphinha does dive, he's going down already before Asensio touches him. Only commenting on this call, not the previous ones, and not defending any of the shit Madrid pulled yesterday, before anybody gets angry."
embarrassing dive
Not a pen but that does not get overturned if it’s Madrid
Great call by the ref
"I love this ref. 

He VAR'd that, see Raphinha actually dived, carded him."
This is one of the best dives i’ve seen.
terrible dive
Biggest dive I’ve ever seen
"100% a dive. Good job.

How can you even try to argue that?"
if he didnt fucking dive so fakely he might've gotten a penalty or at least a shot on target. disgraceful.
"I see Asensio pushing him in the back too, not just the feet to look at."
"No touch, but if the pen was given kinda understandable, it's gonna be controversial decision either way."
"Clear dive , good call"
I’m gonna bet 1000euros on a real win now
LMAO the only time VAR gets involved is to save Madrid
"Clear Raphinha foot touches the ground and he falls over, he want even touched.."
Barcelona is getting seriously robbed. This wasn’t a pen but there were 2 more and a red card they didn’t care to check
"Barcelona please smash this pathetic club in extra time. 

Please do"
Diving cunt
"Correct call, now go back and review the other one"
Fukkckckck offf and he fuckin booked raphinha
"Well it's not penalty clearly, but I'm kinda getting mad because he didn't get call from VAR room for like 3 obvious one. Fuck this referee fucking bitch"
"Thats not a dive though???? He is clearly clipped

Not even taking into account if he gives a pen or not."
Absolute robbery. Real fans should be ashamed for supporting this club. No pen on cubarsi and now this one.
Correct decision
"Good shit that a dive is being punished accordingly for once, even if it's against my team. I just wish that happened every single time someone dives."
ref is so scared to give a call to Barca. This one you probably don’t give but there’s at least two others you give to Barca. Madrid fans will still complain tho 🤣
Shit ref finally having a good game.
Ball don't lie
He doesn’t touch him
Clips his left foot imho. Soft pen but shouldn't be overturned
"What a joke, 🤣🤣"
It's on full display now. Pathetic. This is not football. Insane corruption.
"Not a pen, but not a yellow to Raphinha either. It looked like he misstepped with his left foot, sort of twister his ankle and fell because of that."
"Damn, all these experts here calling it a penalty 🤣 football fans are something else"
"There was a pen before that the ref missed, but yeah this one isn't a pen at all, clear dive"
He was going down before contact
Barca should just go home. Fuck this cup
This is such a spicy game. Drama and ref fans are winning big time.
"If I had a nickel for every penalty called back for an offside, I'd have two nickles, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it's happen twice in the same game."
"Correct decision this time.

The one before tho..."
its such a convincing fumble but on the replays i just cant see the contact
Thats a clever dive from Raphinha tbf
Great decision
obvious dive
Dive is a dive thankfully all the controversy was put to the side for this match
How does raphinha not have an Oscar
Why no foul on Rudiger earlier? Absolute joke of a ref team.
Very very lucky he slipped before the contact.
Drive and rightfully overturn but that Ferran PK.... Ref has done a good job IMO those fouls are hard to catch live but God dam where was VAR? Ferran and Cubarsi  should have been called by VAR. I get the referee missed those but VAR come on.
Either you have VAR and then you all fix the wrong calls or you don't have VAR at all. This is extremely unbalanced
Good job using VAR to call this correctly. How about the 2 other shouts we've had. Why isn't VAR used for a single one of those.
FALLON D FLOOR WINNER
"Takeaway lesson, it pays for a fan base to harass a ref's kids."
"The controversy is not about if Asencio trips him or not, but about what he does with his right hand. Is he pushing him with enough force so that Raphinha falls due to that? would like to see a video not slowed down."
"Fallon d Floor nominee 

Raphinha is a serial diver, yet he's gonna get Bdor shouts

But ig he didn't go to college right ... ?"
Never a penalty. Sucks that this is the one that gets called to a VAR review but not the two other clear incidents.
"Thats a pen. Two points of contact, one behind the knee. Ref is scared"
Would have been soft but a penalty imo
fuck off cunts
Nah f that referee now the kids in his sons school are justified calling his das a thief. Like wtf is he smoking
Obvious dive
Genuinely elite dive
I can’t even blame the ref. This is ALL on real madrid being literal children and whining and trying to influence the game. The ref looks terrified.
"You can argue that you don't actually have to touch for it to be a PK, but Raphinha also went down way too easily.

It hasn't been his day. Missing 2 gilded chances and diving a for PK."
"Not a pen, but a horror challenge by the defender, gets nowhere the ball, in his own box, in the 90+10 minute, and goes in with both legs. What a dummy🤣"
Never a pen
"Valverde's handball, Ceballos on Cubarsi and now this LMFAO. This is some mafia shit."
"I don't like the call for the penalty, but I equally don't like the decision to overturn"
No penalty. The one thing I hate about Brazilian football is how much we love to dive.
"They've made a couple stupid comments about fouls during the match.

Need to go Specsavers."
Ye was weird
"Embarrassing isn't it, was still calling it not a dive even after proven obvious"
probably had the teams reversed in his mind
"They changed their view after seeing the Var angle though, the one that the referee was shown, which tbh does make things very clear"
"Maybe barely. But it's Asencio smacking him on the back that makes Raphinha fall, so no really a dive either"
"Premier Sports commentators are so fucking shit, especially that old guy fucking hell he’s probably the most stupid person i’ve ever heard all he does is yap and state the obvious"
"Rather ironically, if he didn't dive, he absolutely would have had his leg swiped out and likely the penalty would have stood (unlike him)."
Asencios right knee hits Raphinas left ankle and he can't plant his foot so he falls. You can clearly see it on the first replay.
"It looked like he swiped his leg when it was live. They showed the same angle over and over which made it look like a penalty. They then showed a completely different angle with VAR which shows little contact. It’s all about perspective, the commentators were seeing the same angle which looks guilty until they showed the angle VAR was seeing all along."
There isn't much controversy for this one. There is no contact for Raphinha to go down
"No controversy, cant give that pen in the 90’ to decide a final when there is VAR available, Raphinha straight up dived, should have gone for the shot"
I mean it was a very very soft pen to give. Not nearly enough to decide such a dramatic competition.
"This is hardly a controversial decision. In the right angle, you can see that Asensio feet didn’t even touch Raphinha."
"I'm not mad about extra time though, this has been a great game to watch and my gf is napping while I watch so this means more football before she wakes up and makes me so shit!"
"I am urging everyone thinking that referees are always shit and that video refereeing will only result in correct decisions , to consider this call, and how it is impossible to make a call that everyone agrees with.  This could have gone either way. No matter how many video angles and slow motions we have, it's never going to be 100% unanimous. Let's learn to live with it again. "
Our bribes guarantee controversy 😂😂😂
"Other three*

- Handball super clear

- Pedri gets his shirt ripped off right as the ball bounced by him from the post

- Ferran gets his leg swept off balance"
Any other match ref could get away with missing one the making up for it like they do all the time. But this isn't the match to do it. VAR should intervened in the the other 2 though.
This sub would love a penalty at the 90+10 minute on a final.
"How is this not a penalty? Clear contact with the player, no contact with the ball.

If you did this in midfield would you say no free kick?"
"VAR finally found the telephone

2 obvious pens not given

At least they got this right but where have they been all game"
"Correct decision, but VAR only works for one of the teams"
The clear pen one was ignored by VAR and this one that was a clear dive VAR acted quickly... looks like the referee is the only one working fairly here.
"Why on earth he should called the Ferran one?

Just because the was a contact because Ferran was falling backwards into the foot?"
Nah the Torres one hes gone down looking for it under such little contact. He made contact for sure but not enough for a penalty im sorry
Madrid have gotten away with 3 stonewall penalties this match LMAO
Barca fans now know how it felt playing against them last decade 😂 they would always get away playing dirty
Scared? He seems to be enjoying quite much.
And the valverde one and the pedri one lol. Ofcourse he whistles on the one that is not an actual pen 🤣
"Agree, if there was one penalty, it was the one on Ferran"
I don’t blame him for being scared. A multi-billion dollar organisation legit tried to semi-pressure him and have seen him bullied and sent death threats. They should have been fined into oblivion.
"Both were pens. 

Edit: after looking at the reply sure this one was 50-50, but its shameful how 2 obvious pens weren't even reviewed. Still a joke."
Surprised to see that VAR isn't utterly incompetent and actually exists. I wonder were they were in the other 2 clear penalties lmao
VAR could have just given the first one.
IMO the pull on Cubarsi in the first half was a lot clearer than the Ferran play. But here it's the right call.
"This one, by itself, wasn't a pen. He may have made mistakes before (this ref is known for making mistakes) but for this one he let VAR review it because it was the final minute and a match decider. There wasn't enough to give a final minute penalty. The others are a different conversation, though."
"I'm sorry, what ""clear penalty"" wasn't given? When Ferran slipped?"
if any pen needed to be studied for 5 mins by VAR should have been the one on Cubarsi in the first half
Where is the VAR for the Ferran one??? At least call the ref to the screen. Its so blatant
"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here, I thought the two everyone's crying about weren't pens at all, but this looks like it was one to me."
Blatant dive but tensions are high so people are seeing what they wanna see
2 dives but arsocca already decided whats the agenda
i don't bother commenting on posts anymore too many armchair fans that have never kicked a ball in their life
I don't think anyone is questioning this one. They're questioning why VAR didn't speak up a minute earlier.
r/soccer 's wet dream. All the haters out in force! Barca dive in the 96th minute!
No one is saying this is a pen though
"Even fernan getting ""tripped"" by a tap on an foot thats in the air"
Everyone is agreeing this one isn't a pen. The issue is the two clear pens before.
Everyone is saying it's a dive. What are you saying?
Cubarsi and Ferrans were more clear
"All the ""clear pens"" this game have been anything but. Great game by the ref for me. Let them play"
What about the Fermin one
"We all agree that it's a dive. However, that doesn't negate the blatant robbery that has happened."
His knee hits Raphina on the ankle???
this is not a pen but the other 2 should have been investigated by VAR too
The one before it was.
Ref is scared for his family
"Rudiger? Waht about hand and what about rugby tackle on Cubarsi, 3 obvious one"
"It's not corruption, it just follows the usual VAR logic"
The rudiger is way too soft for Var to be calling the ref. Ferran throws himself at Rudiger at first as well.
because the Rudi one wasn't one too
The Rudiger tackle was like a 20% penalty. Not really something the VAR should call out the ref for.
Yeah that rudiger man
"Or red card Modric, or red card Tchouameni"
"Yeah, if you watch Raphinha's left ankle, although you can't see the contact, it must have been hit to react like that. This decision is much more of a close call than everyone seems to think here and I don't think it's a clear dive (maybe embellished, but then most fouls are)."
Yes. There seems to be 3 different contacts. Ralph’s trailing leg gets hit and the Fran puts his hand on his back. La Liga has some notorious diving incidents but this ain’t it
How’s that?
He does not touch him
"How? There is no contact, my stream showed a perfect angle"
I’m more much pissed about the one two mins before tbh
Of course liverpool fans would be hurt about this
VAR looks into plenty of stuff they just don't call the ref when they feel his decision makes sense
After the VAR review none of us are claiming it was a penalty.
"I pray that one day football follows the rules of rugby regarding divers so we can eradicate simulations from our sport within a few years max. 

Imagine if he had to get out of the field for 15min after such a dive. Players would stop real fast."
You should’ve watched the whole game not just this clip if this is the kind of ref you want in the PL
have you watched the entire match 🤣
"FallonD'Floor except it wasnt embarrassing, it was a hella of a great dive. i thought it was a clear pen until the VAR showed angles lmao"
Who? Flopinha? It isn’t the olympics anymore with that shit 💀
"not a pen bruh, Raphinha sees the leg out and does a very graceful flop"
Completely unbiased comment
That was a clear dive
It was a clear dive?
Did you not watch the footage?
"He doesnt even touch him, what haha"
Yeah idk why he didn’t try a shot
Bingo but this is soccer thread Madrid bias will make you believe otherwise as by reading all posts here
Push on the back look at his arm on raiphs contact is contact
Florentino only allows review if it's to favor madrid. It is what it is.
how is that a pen ? its a clear dive.
Yeah it was a laughably blatant dive
you might need to visit your eye doctor
He didn’t even touch lol. The 2nd VAR angle shows it.
Theres no way you actually believe this is a pen after seeing all those angles. I refuse to believe it.
It wasn’t even remotely a pen lmao
"That was done intentionally , he was looking for a pen."
The other wasn’t even a pen
what contact?
but thats on the VAR and the rules surrounding the VAR not on the ref.
not everything has to be either end of the extreme.
We can't have that can we now? Florentino owns the federación.
Go complain to RMTV about it
"Yeah maybe. I was just bemused, the commentator saying he ‘clattered him’ lol"
"Agree. But it was a penalty like 30 seconds before that, and VAR didn't intervene."
"I agree. But where is the VAR check on ferran pen? Wheres the VAR check on the cubarsi pen??

Its INSANE, I least the whole world can see it"
True but why only go to VAR for this one when previously there have been two clear fouls in the box. One in the first half and one just minutes earlier
"What about the shove tho


Edit: if a shove is never a pen then we have different definitions of what futbol is."
"Defender right knee goes into contact with attacker back leg, no?

IDK if that os a foul but it seems like there was contact."
"If you watch at 0:03 and 0:41, it looks like Raul Asensio's *right* knee hits Raphinha's *left* ankle. Everyone's watching the other legs. On the other replays it seems like there's no contact at all so Idk"
"Don't look at the feet, Asencio smacks him on the back which is when Raphina starts falling"
Explain how VAR gives Raphinha a yellow card per the rules of using VAR
The slap on the back can definitely put you off balance at that speed
I'm mostly just annoyed by how long this check took and how we still don't have time pausing in the game in 2025.
"There were, like 3 episodes before when he didn't give a pen. Didn't even review. He chose the worst one to review. He knows what he is doing."
Also not enough to overturn it especially given how favored Madrid has been
That's a terrible way to think about it. Foul's a foul no matter what the occasion
"It was a pen, specially for the shove. But hey the VAR should call the ref only if they know it's not a pen, there is clear contact yet they call him"
"It wasn’t ""soft"", it was a dive and not a penalty by any definition. The previous play was a clear cut pen though."
Not Pedri but Cubarsi
Handball is not a pen according to the rules.
"Sliding tackle is an integral part of the game, and accepted in football so because of it, players can not be penalized for using hands to support themselves while doing them as it would be dangerous for players.

This is why it is explicitly stated in rules that handball by supporting arm while sliding is not called."
"Handball?  By Valverde? They don't call these anymore from what I've seen


If you ask me its stupid"
2nd one both players were grabbing on eachother tbf
Didn’t Ferran run right into Rüdiger first
"Thank fuck people like you aren’t professional referees. Might as well give a pen for every single push and nudge that occurs in the box. 

The first one isn’t a pen whatsoever by the rules, his arm wasn’t in an unnatural position. 

I’m not even going to bother with the second one. 

The third one is the only incident that could’ve ended in a penalty. Would’ve been really weak but I’ve seen them given."
Yall create your own happiness to run the corrupt madrid gimmick none of these were penalties at all 😂😂😂
"That was Cubarsi , not Pedri who got the shirt ripped off"
Other twenty-nine**
"- support arm when sliding is not a pen nowadays by rules

- both are using both their hands, 50/50

- a contact is not automatically a foul, it was 50/50 dive and a foul, striker already lost balance and other defender would had the ball. At least ref was consistent from beginning in allowing hard football by today standards and by consistency aspect this too is 50/50 

So I get ref decisions, at least now RM cannot whine ❤️😂"
"The handball one wasn't cos you can break a fall.

The second one doesn't get called cos both are pulling, although I do think it should have been as he was pulled away again as the ball passes by.

I agree on the last, maybe a tad soft but the contact is clear."
Good thing Madrid prepared for this by intimidating the ref before match
second one was cubarsi but yes 100% a pen
"Again with the Fede handball. The ref saw it and explained the rules, go complain to uefa for the rules."
The madrid death threats prob reached the VAR room 😂😂
they gave a right var decision because it benefits madrid
Anyone who thinks there should have been a pen for cubarsi is not qualified to speak about anything football related.
The cubarsi one is not a pen stop it
"Ferran literally got his foot swiped by rudiger in the Box.

that's a pen cmon"
"Yeah, that made Rudiger scoop up Ferran’s leg. Don’t be a fool."
"Bruh the mental gymnasitics to declare a leg swipe ""falling backwards into the foot"""
I guess Rudiger can do whatever the fuck he wants and yet fans will defend that piece of scum
Rudiger did kick him but ferran headbutted or fell onto his chest. That’s what the ref saw and gave the foul for
why 3? let's go for 7
How? Asencio didn’t even touch Raphinha’s feet.
No lol diving all game
"Nah, *this* one is a clear dive, the one before absolutely was a pen tho"
"> I wonder were they were in the other 2 clear penalties lmao

You know exactly why lmao"
They are only checking things that wouldn’t be in favor of Madrid. It’s truly disgusting
then var works only when madrid benefits from it seems?
you tend to slip when someone takes your planted foot to the side
just because rudiger doesn't go ball deeps in that tackle it doesnt mean its not a penalty mate
His right foot got kicked.
Slipped? SLIPPED???? LOL how biased are you
"When Rudiger clearly tripped Ferran. This was not a pen, but that one definitely was."
"The other 2 were soft but possible pens, while this one should be a pen 90% of the times judging from the context of Madrid horrid defense, but Asensio got really lucky and Raphinha did dive."
"Barca players was diving a lot, it is not an easy game to be referee"
"There is no contact on the feet, but are we just ignoring the fact that he winds up and slaps a man in the back?

If he does that while staying on his feet, that'd be a pen and a card all day. Why is it different cause he's throwing himself down?"
What professional team do you play for?
His only clear error imo was not giving Tchou a red card for his scissor tackle in the first half
Tchouameni scissor tackle from behind. Bellingham no card on the tackle on Pedri with his high foot. Cubarsi getting dragged down by Ceballos in the dbox. Get the fuck out with your “red did great”
Not as dirty as Suarez on Varane
No no. Don't get things twisted. It's corruption.
"I agree the sudden motion of the ankle makes it obvious.

I would also say the contact is more than enough to trip him up, and attempting to take another step with the left foot after contact is more dangerous than rolling safely like he did. So going down is not just a ""deceive the referee"" thing, but a natural instinct that even children playing in the back yard with no referees do.

If we give VAR the benefit of the doubt, they probably got it wrong because they were only looking at the opposite foot."
Ascencio doesnt touch him. Clear dive and a yellow.
push on the back and contact on Raphinha's back leg
"I am appalled why people think this one is a penalty.

Even surprised the commentators are split on this. One was convinced it was a penalty and the other thought otherwise"
Well I thought it was a clear dive. Looked stonewall pen at first but VAR did its job.
Not you getting downvoted for stating a fact lmao.
"Everyone saying he doesn’t touch him but he clearly puts his hand on his back. 

Now whether that’s enough to be considered a shove and a penalty is another question, but there is definitely contact."
Mate you've gotten away with 2-3 penalties by now
This wasnt a penalty but the other 2 were lol
"Well yes, I'd agree with that. That's why i said if it's given it understandable."
Push on the back contact is contact
The first angle shows a clear contact. I'm fine with not giving a penalty but yellow is just wrong.
for real now
The first angle shows a clear contact. I'm fine with not giving a penalty but yellow is just wrong.
"I believe that rudiger should have at least had a yellow this match, mbappe shouldn’t have played and there was a penalty on cubarsi in the first half and a pen on ferran. Conclusion: robbery."
"Cubarsi got undressed on the far post, VAR not calling it was insane."
Spanish language espn commentators were calling for pen on both
"Am I going insane that Ferran one is never a pen - he barely taps him on the ankle and ferran throws himself to the ground! 

Cubarsi one absolutely is a pen"
Cubarsi one was totally a penalty
Only Cubarsi one needed a var check. Ferran is not a pen.
Absolutely not a pen. Not every touch is a pen
"I think the fact that people are debating the Ferran and Curbasi one, its not clear and obvious enough to go to the monitor. Unlike this one, initially I thought it was a pen 100% but the angles showed a very clear viewing.

Only things I think people can complain about justifiably without a doubt is the no cards for Rudiger, Vazquez, and probably someone else (clearly) that im forgetting."
The whole has seen it for the past 20 years. Champions League and in Spain.
That shove is never a pen. Ferran’s was clear on replay and VAR chose not to send the ref to review it
nah that’s nothing. Cant scam a penalty with that by throwing yourself to the ground
He's already going down imo
Usually if it's this late in the game they won't give a pen for just a push. That's a game decider so if they're gonna give a pen in the final minute it's gotta be a little more substantial
he was already falling before he touched his back
it was less smack and more flap
"No no Asencio actually punched him but the var scammers didn’t show it. /s

The barca bias in this sub is moronic."
"Really? Hahaah wtf, he dove clearly"
"Everything can make you lose balance at high speeds, even the wind blowing lol. It’s the player job to maintain balance when running."
"It can but that wouldn't be enough for a final minute penalty, usually"
"Not his decision to review, the VAR does that"
"The ref on field doesnt decide this

and this was a clear dive they had to review"
"Yes, the referee chooses when to go and check. You're an absolute moron mate."
Are you trying to pull off a reverse-negreira Uno card?
Final minute penalty he HAS to review it. Too important
"nah its enough to overturn, the ref probably communicated he saw leg contact, that's how it works not ""hey there is no leg contact but there is a hand maybe"""
"It’s not stupid it’s common sense, he can’t put his arm anywhere else,"
"Yes leading up to it, but Ceballos (or whoever it was) pulled way more and pulled his shirt hard while Pedri just had his hands a bit on him. And mainly the Real player kept pulling him as the ball passed. Clearly crossed the line."
Yes it was. He clearly prevented a tap in
That one is the most obvious
Yes it is 😭
The clear shirt pull that was obvious is not a pen? Lmao
Football is soft today because defenders can't do shit they have been doing forever
Rüdiger has made some very unnecessary fouls that should've been punished but the one OP is talking about was not a foul
"Piece of scum, bit dramatic don’t you think?"
As long as the opposing player fucks up a dribble and stumbles into him? Yeah
"Eh, the slap + marginal pull gives enough ground to hold the on-field call.

They just pussied out because they would probably get stabbed on the streets if they gave this."
That's clearly not even true. Barca has dodged multiple penalties and free kicks at this point.
VAR can’t change that old penalty call. There are rules when VAR can be summoned.
Rüdiger was ball deeps in your mom.
your regular 40 year old mate who plays sunday league would see it's a blatant dive don't need to play professional buddy
Totally unbiased lmao
"that one wasnt a pen, but where was var a minute before"
"I wonder if people think these VAR refs just sit there in front of all these monitors and... Idk, read a book or something"
"Rüdiger one maybe, what the fuck are the other 2 supposed to be?"
Those would not have been given in favor of us any day lol
"Contact is not contact lol this is a contact sport, is this the first match you’ve ever watched?"
The second one is debatable. Raf got hit on the back for sure. But probably shouldn't go down like that. The one before was a clear Pen. How VAR didn't say anything was beyond me.... clearly the campaign against referee worked. looking for them to do more of this kind in the future...
English commentators too. When Steve McManaman is saying something against Madrid you know it’s right
In the moment this one looked a penalty and then the reports showed it to be a well timed dive.
"Agree on the Ferran one. Good non call. VAR has people spasming out on every contact, players going down so easily"
"When you're trying to control the ball with one foot and the defender drags your other foot from behind, you're definitely going to fall. Why is it so difficult to understand?"
"I kinda wish atp that tchouameni didn't score because rudiger was pulled to the ground there and they were never going to give that, just so yall shut up. Refs almost never do anything about fouls on corners. Not saying it should be this way, but it is"
Fallon dor Raphinia and ferran
"yeah, it's a pat on the back basically, if you go down from that you're diving. The dude's weight is under his arm, it's not behind his arm into the player, there is zero force there at all. Ferran's looks much clearer, this one was fully deserving of the yellow card."
Cubarsi barely touched someone on the back and conceded a penalty 🤷‍♂️
I'll take your word since you see Vini do it multiple times each week
He doesn't decide when to whistle? Lol
"Yeah I never appreciated that rationale, sorry"
Very similar to Cucurella vs Haaland last season
"Ferran is a pen, cubarsi is not, he was also pulling ceballos"
"Cubarsi also pulled the shirt of Ceballos, probably thats why it wasn't given"
I think you missed Cubarsi also very clearly pulling Ceballos the whole time.
Both teams have been pushing and pulling on corners all night long without a single foul being called for any of them.
A foot swipe is always a pen what the fuck are you saying
Have you seen half of the tackles Rudiger puts in?
As a player I can excuse his behavior but off the pitch he is even worse I would get banned
What penalty did they dodge? Give me one time there was something in this game Barca got favored in
Penalti a favor del Real Madrid
Just watch Raphinas foot how it bends. And then I would suggest you stop chatting while watching replays with your eyes closed.
"I’m an expert on divers.

I watch Vini, Neymar (on his prime), Raphinha, and others too"
That was a goal-scoring opportunity brother. And Cubarsi's shirt was being tugged from the beginning.
Have you seen any of their tackles on Vini or Mbappe while they're making a run? You've got to be joking.
Fairplay lol. I would keep going but Im scared RM TV might come after me next
You mean the offside one? Learn the rules
No dumbass not the offside one obviously.
"200 IQ play by Kane. His curse won't affect the team if he's not playing, thus ensuring his first title."
He found a way to trick the universe
Oh thank god. At least the world won’t collapse
And it’s for not giving the ball back lmao 
pitch invasion initated by harry
The man is cursed. 
Gonna do a John Terry
"For everyone not familiar with the Bundesliga rules, this will also mean that, should Bayern win, Kane will not officially be recognized as having won the Bundesliga title."
Absolute scenes when he's with the Schickeria unfurling a tifo
He Dr. Strange’d his way to the title. It was the only way.
Do you really get a ban for accumulating 5 yellows across like 30 games 
Gonna be a full kit wanker
The universe couldn’t allow that
"How can this guy always find a way to avoid the trophy is never stop to amaze me. 

Im flabbergasted really"
When he wins I expect the TVA to appear and purge this timeline.
Literally doesn’t matter tho does it?
He just wants to enjoy his first title drinking beer in the stands.
he genuinely found a way
Kane Unable.
Imagine if this were the match they got presented a trophy
He needs to wear full kit under a coat and be prepared to run on the pitch while taking the coat off. Never done before let’s go
You can’t make this shit up
Harry Kane's curse find it way yet again xD
Is this cheating
the curse heard everyone talking shit
Will he there with his full kit to lift the trophy?
The football gods showing their displeasure. 
The universe won't allow Kane to officially hold a trophy
They're still 8 points ahead. This matters more for the golden boot race
Absolute Mad Lad
The one they are 8 points clear of? Fuck off to with this title.
Officially null and void im afraid. Shouldn’t let this thug get his hands on the trophy
Now he won't be able to break Lewandowski's goal record. Just 17 goals to equal it. 3 games would be tough but 2 is unfortunately impossible.
Way to think ahead — keep that curse away from that match. Only way to break it.
Why is 5th yellow warranting a suspension at this stage? I think in PL it's 10 yellows after Winter to get a suspension?
After only 5? That’s stupid
Man.... It's going to be generationally hilarious if they lose and Leverkusen take the cake.. goddamn
"Harry Kane a dirty prick. So dirty he has an illegal ""challenge"" named after him"
Why didn't spurs just not play him in all those finals? Are they stupid?
"Just wait until Bayern still play him.  
Making them be deducted 10 points."
First title? You’re forgetting the Audi Cup mate
Life found a way
Win the Bundesliga with this one simple trick.
You're sure about that?
"Look, he just grew attached, okay?"
"He’s not a big game player and he knows it, he’s a team player getting himself banned so his team don’t suffer"
Mans gonna John Terry it and come out in full kit for the trophy ceremony
Pretty good idea of him to get out of the way then.
Reverse psychology
"nah, that was 4D chess, my boy Kane ensuring he misses next match so that we win the trophy"
The mark of Kane
Thinking full kit or just training tracky?
"What happened with John Terry, I’m not familiar with the reference here"
Keeping the full kit wanker tradition alive eh
"Such a good joke, my heart genuinely sank for him for a moment even though I know better"
"""To be eligible for a medal you need a minimum of X games played. After his suspension Kane can play X-1 at most"""
Wtf!! Really???
Bait used to be believable
If I was a player and I got injured or suspended I'd be with the ultras every single match day
Insanity. I’m glad the PL has cut offs
"Kind of. Not having Kane makes any game harder for Bayern. And we still need to win the game, or that at least makes it simpler. 

If Leverkusen lose against Freiburg (tough game but Leverkusen should still win) then it doesn’t matter because Bayern are automatically champions. 

But winning 3 more points in any fashion automatically secures it for Bayern."
"They play Rb and Monchengladbach next. If they somehow loose both it goes to final day.



It couldn't happen could it?"
All it means is he will miss the game when they'll most probably win the title. Which will be the next game.
"There is morning over dramatic? It's just a fact that he is missing the next match, and the next match could secure bayern the title."
"Not the best rule, probably. He had some words about it after. 

> First of all, I think it was a crazy decision. It's never a yellow card. Unfortunately, sometimes people come to the Allianz Arena and try to make a name for themselves. That's why I'm really disappointed that I got the yellow card, because of course I knew I already had four. And secondly, I think the rule is crazy anyway. Five yellow cards in 34 games means a suspension. That's crazy. It should be like in the Premier League [yellow cards are reset after 19 matchdays]. I'm missing an important game because I received a yellow card in the first game of the season. That doesn't make sense. Maybe they should reconsider that for the future. It's kind of my story that I'll miss the game in Leipzig. But no worries, I'll celebrate more than anyone else."
I mean there is no way they lose the title.
Bayern needs one more point in 4 games. I really don't think we can bottle this anymore
Unless you’re an Arsenal fan I don’t know why you’d care if Kane wins a trophy lol
Nah those trophyless memes are kind of boring now.
The yellow was for time wasting/dissent. He held the ball a bit too long after a foul.
Is that the backing into someone while humping?
"Does Partey have a move named after him or not?

Maybe Arteta and everyone at the club for backing him? What's that move called?"
"He doesn't just some bitter sorts put that on him, most of the time it's just him standing his ground against an out of control player."
"As a Spurs fan, a wholehearted yes. Yes we are."
You joke but they genuinely should have done this in the Champions League final. They played a half fit Kane over a red hot Lucas Moura.
"Kane, uh... finds a way..."
Funny thing is that few other Chelsea players did it that night but only Terry caught flak for it.
r/fullkitwanker
is... is that frowned upon for some reason?
Anthony Gordon in this years caraboa too.
They won’t present the trophy away from home anyway.
"Not sure why Terry keeps getting flak for it, he was unbelievable in the semis in both legs until he lost his head and was the main reason we got to the final. Man deserved that trophy more than anyone else."
"Full kit, but he rolls around on the grass to dirty it up so he looks like he played the match."
"When chelsea won champions league, he was suspended from the final. In the celebrations, he rocked up in full kit including boots and shin pads like he had just played."
"When Chelsea won the Champions League in 2012, John Terry joined the celebrations in his full kit and lifted the trophy, this is despite him not playing in the final because he got a red card in the semis. 

He made himself the focal point of Chelsea's victory even though he didn't do anything, hence, ""John Terry full kit wanker"""
"Mate, just think on that for 2 seconds and you'll know he's making a joke"
"It's one of the rules of the universe, sorry you had to find out this way."
"Yes? This is Soccer, not circlejerk"
"Hey sorry, I just wanted to make a silly joke :("
Isnt Walter Frosxh responsible for that?
PL is a never nude
Wait what? You don\`t get a ban for yellows in the Prem?
"Maybe, but I doubt it. They just need a draw to win by goal difference. Monchengladbach have also lost their last 3 so I'm not expecting anything from them to win"
Basically just need a point in the last 3 games so it’s as close to secured as you can kind of get lol. GD is an impossible margin.
This really is the year he wins a trophy. Never thought I’d see the day.
"I don’t care if Kane wins a trophy now that he’s not at Tottenham, his trophy cabinet doesn’t effect us anymore."
That wasn't my point
Yes. He's a nasty player and it's a miracle he hasn't severly injured someone
Is it called: Unnamed EPL Player?
Deflecting Kane's shitty behaviour onto another issue? So you don't think what Kane does is an issue?
"Fuck off, it's cynical"
"I felt sorry for Moura, imagine you score a second half hatrick to send your team to the Champions League final and you get benched for it"
r/yourjokebutthesame
Kane……….always finds a way
"Terry is a toe rag, and his mother is a cheese thief"
He was captain. Him doing it probably set the precedent for the others to do so too.
Why the fuck was this banned lmao
only when cunts do it
If it gives him the confidence to help England win the WC again next year I’ll take it
That’s fucking hilarious. I don’t even blame him for it lol brilliant move.
Aguero full kit in last WC
It was Europa
The full kit is a bit WTF but the captain lifting the trophy is hardly the most egrigious thing in the world.
"To be fair, He was captain and Mr. Chelsea for a whole decade before that. Zidane gets gets flak for the headbutt than Terry gets for celebrating."
Alright lifting the trophy in these circumstances is a bit much lmao
"When I see responses like that, it terrifies me how easily massive parts of society will be influenced when AI really kicks off. People are bad enough as it is."
"I didn't believe him, but can you explain the joke?"
I thought they just liked cutoffs...
"You do but it restarts. Five yellows inside the first 19 games is a one-match ban, 10 yellows inside the first 33 games is a two-match ban. 15 yellows is a three-match ban and there’s no cutoff for that."
"You do, but it’s 5 yellows in the first 19 games of the season (1 game), and/or 10 yellows total across the first 32 games (2 games), and/or 15 yellows in the whole season (3 games). If you get your 5th yellow in the second half of the season there’s no suspension."
i think it has a cutoff date or resets so its not just 5 within the whole season
"you get suspended if you get 5 yellows in the first 19 games, if you survive the first 19, the threshold increases to 10"
"You do. They have cutoffs tho.
Up to the 19th game it's 5 yellows.
From game 20-32 it's 10 yellows
And all season it's 15 yellows"
There are match limits of sorts. You get banned for one game for 5 yellow cards if they occur within the first half of the season.
They do but it resets after half way through the season I think
They reset 19 games in. 4 yellows and then suspended
"You do, but the threshold raises to 10 after the halfway point."
You do. But it resets after the 30 match day I think it was
I saw this commented before: winning your first trophy with Bayern in the Bundesliga is like losing your virginity to a prostitute. It doesn’t count.
"Yea, now that I think about it more, you as an Arsenal fan would almost prefer it to fuel Tottenham never winning anything while their legends keep winning it elsewhere."
I know it wasn’t.
Pretty sure he stopped doing that bout 4 years back
That might just be it. Defending him is probably called the 'got away on a technicality so not proven guilty' move.
">So you don't think what Kane does is an issue?

He's only done it once or twice. And when he did it wasn't very nice, no. However these things happen on the pitch. don't have to act like he's done it as many times as Partey has done his signature move, do we now?

In turn deflecting away from Partey's behaviour now. Does that mean you don't think what he does is an issue?"
"So many other players have done it, and still do it to this day. Harry did it once or twice about four years back and people like you still obsess about it. Strange behaviour imo."
You seem super chill.
"true, but how many will have the courage to start Moura over an available Kane in that game?"
That's offensive. My mum is a cheese thief and I'm offended.
But does his father smell of elderberries?
Subreddits get banned when they are unmoderated
"Maybe the secret is to drop him for the final, maybe that gets around his curse."
I would 100% do that in Sunday league. Champions League final? Absolutely.
Didn't have the shorts so doesn't count as full kit
He did it twice. The Champions League one was the viral one though
"to be fair, he was our captain through the whole campaign and through multiple seasons prior. suspending a player for a final was one of the most stupidest uefa rules ever, and they got rid of it the very next season. (granted Terry had a red and not double yellow). it would have been weird not to have Terry lift the cup, and it would have been weird to have him lift the cup in a suit while being surrounded by teammates in jerseys."
"I've been gullible as fuck my whole life, bad enough that I would get bullied at school because I just couldn't recognise when people were having me on, and even I have wised up more than the average 50-something bloke sharing AI generated pictures on whatsapp"
@grok is this true?
Autism exists
That person's vote means just as much as yours does. Wild shit
The joke is that Kane never wins a trophy
Having 2 or 3 match bans for yellow cards feels weird. How do people in England feel about it?
So you could technically get 9 yellows without a suspension if you start getting yellows with game 20?
"Huh, never knew about this. Can I know since when was it like this? 

That's actually smart and a good system."
"But if you get just the 5 in the second half of the season, and none in the first half, you're not suspended? I genuinely didn't know this part of its true 😂"
"Let's say he didn't score any goals and was absolutely terrible. 

THEN you might have a point. Then it would look like his teammates were carrying him. 

But he scores a lot of goals and creates a lot of them too. 

Plus, Leverkusen are actually good now and a threat.

This isn't the old days when Bayern used to win the league by 20 points. 

Nice try."
Cant be. Last thread was full of comments that he still does it on regular basis. Shame their internet died or something and they couldn't provide video evidence when asked.
"I clearly referred to it as an ""issue"" ffs. I'm not going to argue with a 13 year old"
Wasn't Kane like not fit lol
"You'd hope any manager that actually wants to win. Kane had been injured for months and IIRC had only had a few short sub appearances before the final in an attempt to get fit, he had no buisness starting. Would have been better to bring him on as a sub in the second half, Moura got done dirty."
"""Available"" bro was half dead."
Yes and I fart in his general direction
"Saka 87 
2-1"
Ah OK fair enough - Europa one for some reason sticks in my mind
"> suspending a player for a final was one of the most stupidest uefa rules ever, and they got rid of it the very next season.

Terry would have been suspended for the final in this or any other season since. He got a straight red for kneeing a player in the back off the ball - I think while the ball was out of play even? It was dirty and incredibly stupid. I can't think of many players who looked stupider for something they did on the pitch at any point than Terry did in that moment. What a moron."
Roy Keane in 99 didn't do it
"Username sort of checks out…?

But yeah I think I’m with you lol"
Eh it's pretty normal I've never really thought about it as an issue
"To be fair 15 yellows over a season deserves some flak, moreso than a red that might as well be just a bad day or even a freak accident"
Or 14 yellows if you start at game 25?
"Feels like forever at this point, I can't remember it not being this way."
It’s true. It’s cumulative for the season. You can get 9 yellows between the two cut offs and be fine.
They’ll have won 12 out of the last 13.
"Downplaying what he did as just 'an issue' is a bit interesting, no?"
"You could have a situation where a player would get his 10th/15th yellow on the 35th/36th matchday and then trying to get a second yellow to reduce his punishment. 

What even happens at 20 yellow?"
It has never happened yet. Seven times have players reached 14. 
caicedo is on 10 yellows this season and hasn't been suspended. he could get 4 more in his next 4 and still not get suspended
"Just like Arsenal and Liverpool. 

Does that also mean the Premier League is terrible?

Nope. Best league in the world. 

Stop hating man."
">What even happens at 20 yellow?

Jail."
2 yellows in a game still counts as 2 separate yellows in this case as well as a red for the game.
"Huh? 

Also they won 11 straight until he showed up"
"Do 2 yellows in the same game always count as 2 yellows for this, since in Germany your first yellow gets deleted and it\`s like you only got a red card."
"Which also happened to coincide with Xavi Alonso going to Leverkusen and turning them into champions. 

Leverkusen had an incredible campaign last year. 

It's not Kane's fault that happened the same year. 

Also, Bayern's defense is much worse than it used to be.

But yeah, it's all Kane's fault."
How many did city when out of the last 5 ? If he wanted to win the prem he could have just went to them instead.

Why did the mods remove the old post?
Mods will surely not keep deleting this.
Mods are afraid of RMTV
"Deleted in 3,2… for some reason"
what even is a penalty anymore
"I may be dumb, but aren't they basically pulling each other?"
They never call those. People act surprised that it wasn't called it now? Not saying is right but have you people seen football... Ever? The amount of shit all teams get away in corners has always been ridiculous
They're holding onto each other like a loving couple in the last moments of the Titanic. Not a penalty.
What is supposed to be a penalty here? They're holding each other. Do you people expect there to be a penalty after every single corner?
"Never a penalty, they are both holding each other."
its hard to give that while Cubarsi is hugging him back so blatantly
Tf is this point of this? Both of them are pulling each other.
Let's fucking Gooo the threatening worked just slide me one pen the next half papi chulo perez 😋😋
I hate Real Madrid with a passion but that is never a pen.
"What am I supposed to be looking at, here?"
How is that not a fucking penalty!!!!!! He was 100% scoring if he didn’t get pulled by the shirt!!!
Dirty madrid as always
Shameless. I don't even blame the refs. They'd sick the fucking national guard after them if there's a VAR pen against Madrid in this match
"Barca, you guys are strong. Stop crying about non existent penalty as they were both on it, it's pathetic. Rudiger's foul on Olmo, on the other hand, deserved a yellow."
"That is actually textbook penalty, no? What the fuck LMAO"
Just keep posting it until the mods get the message.
You can see that Cubarsi has his hands on the defender but the defender is clearly pulling at Cubarsi with way more force because his shirt is pulled all the way.
What there was no claim
I remember Ramos going down from lesser pull and getting penalty.
"Bullshit snub by the VAR Team. We know your equipment works coz you can catch the cancelled pen for Raphinha (rightly so). We just want fairness and consistency.

Even if Barcelona wins, the official channels should blast this as proof that no, Barcelona didn’t get help from the ref of VAR. Include Rudiger’s foul kicking Ferran’s ankle as well. Obvious VAR review calls."
they're both pulling each other how is that supposed to be a pen
If this was the other way around you would see that replay on their next RMTV video when Ricardo de Burgos were selected to officiate their next match.
How is this not given???
That's a pen tbh...
"Tchouameni should’ve been sent out, handball in the box not called against Madrid. This game is outrageously reffed."
"Even with ""mutual holding"" argument, that's insane."
"He is holding carvajal himself, so thats never a red. Sorry reddit hivemind"
What’s crazy is that VAR didn’t even look at this. I could understand if they do and then decide they’re both pulling a bit or there’s a pull on Cubarsi but not enough for a clear and obvious error… but at least take a look at it!
"They’re both holding each other, no pen is probably fair"
Barça as always playing against 12 men. Nothing new. Barça has to score at least 3 more to win against RM safely.
Cant be because Bellingham is saying all calls are pro barca
Cheaters playing against cheaters. Deal with it..
"I don't know what is and is not a penalty anymore. Like, I am not crazy, right ?  There is a colossal argument for Cubarsi being able to get to the ball and score there if he isn't held. This a clear dogso, right ?

Edit : Never mind, on further viewings, they are holding each other."
They’re scared RMA TV will run a hit piece on them
Worried they’d get doxxed by RMTV probably.
"Because it’s a nothing burger, both players are pulling each other. 

I get hating Madrid but jfc"
"Both are holding which often gets it given a pass,

But this one looks so clear because it literally pulls him back from getting the ball."
Aren’t both guys holding and pulling at each other no?
Whatever thing is not against RM
Reverse the jerseys. You'd be fine with this being called a pk for Madrid?? LMAO
The attacker is already goal side. Why would he prefer to hold the defender?
Yes. You're not dumb. You're just not one of the unhinged drama addicts that support these teams.
"One is not looking at the ball, holds before ball comes into play, is on the wrong side. The other has a free path to a tap in."
"Why would Cubarsi be pulling him when he's trying to run towards goal and Ceballos is pulling him back? They both have a hold of each other during the start, but only one player is trying to pull the other away from the ball to prevent a goal. "
"idd, pretty obvious. Sub is just filled with barca-bias"
Cubarsi is trying to get free. He already has the defender beat lmao
This sub is full of 12 year olds. Bunch of dumb fans
Only one is actively going for the ball and is being impeded in trying to do so.
"You are not dumb, just have eye problem, look closer, he tried to push him away"
That’s fair but one of them had a pretty good goal scoring opportunity. Grabbing and holding is part of the game but you can’t sanction an attacker for not just letting himself get thrown around there. In this case Cubarsi was already goal side so Ceballos is the one with the infraction.
If its a Barca player they do apparently.
Lol the attacker is already goal side. That makes all the difference
"From the circle jerk in the match thread, yea.
Barcelona should've gotten one penalty and the referee missed 1-2 yellows I'd say for Real Madrid but people acted so damn dramatic in EVERY Situation."
"Yeah, it's so weird the echo chamber here, none of my friends watching this think it is a penalty, and there are 0 real fans lol."
"If this was reversed, you will have the sub saying Madrid paid the ref off if this was called a pk. LMAO."
"Never is ott, that argument can be made but he's also pulled back as he would have got the ball."
Cubarsie at the back
Shirt pull on cubarsi
Found the VAR team
he taps that in if he doesnt get dragged to the ground
"Cubarsi being pulled back at the back post, all he needs is a toe on it for a goal."
Back post. Cubarsi trying to get to the rebound
because he is also illegally grabbing the defender and stopping him from getting into correct position?
"I do think it's a tight one and less than they claim but what makes me think penalty is that he goes for the ball and ends up going backwards at the key moment,

But they're also both pulling before that, so not crazy that it wasn't given."
are you blind? Look closer
"Ceballos didn’t look at the ball at all, obvious intent to foul and block while Cubarsi is looking at the ball."
There is a colossal argument for Ceballos having been able to contest that ball if Cubarsi wasnt pulling him the whole time.
He was going for the ball in what would have surely been a goal and had his shirt practically ripped off. In what universe is that not a penalty?
Exactly. BOTH HOLDING. If cubarsi isn’t or lets go it’s Pen
"They're still holding each other though. And of course one of them is going to try less hard to stay upright in this situation. I'm not seeing anything problematic in the ref's call here, unless you really want to. As usual."
"Not really? You’re allowed to compete with your man, but given that Curbasi falls basically horizontal you can see where the force is being applied from."
"Watch the clip from the start, Cubarsi was getting dragged around."
I think the barca player wants to go for the ball and the Madrid player is just holding him by the shirt to prevent it
The fuck? Cubarsi is trying to get free.
"It's a stonewall pen, your comment is ridiculous."
"If you aren't, you're clueless. It's way, way, way, way more shocking someone would get mad that this would be called for anyone. It's so fucking obviously a pen."
You should ask him why he did what you can clearly see in the video.
"Doesn't matter why, the fact that his arms are around the defender makes it hard for VAR to intervene."
You can even see the RM player being pulled down when cubarsi is falling
So he can maintain position and keep the defender from getting goal side.
To remain goal side? To draw a penalty? 
"You know what would help with the tap in?

Don’t hold onto the guy who’s out of position when you have a free path to the goal."
"I’m rooting for Barca. This being said…
Look at when Cubarsi is on the ground. The RM player gets jerked down in the last second of this clip. It was braindead by Cubarsi to hold onto his opponent’s arm."
So it's ok to pull the other player if you stop after a while?
but you’re american
"Grabbing and holding may be a part of the game, but it's not allowed via the rules for EITHER player.  By definition they're both fouling each other."
"No, the side to the goal is not important in the letter of the law here. Excessive handling is happening both ways, the attacker doesn’t get the call just because he is the one that could score"
"If Cubarsi had let go, you may have a point. Why would the referee decide in favour of one player, if both hold each other?"
Everyone there was saying they hope Barca would trash madrid before the game. Of course they will cry about everything now 
"This sub hates Madrid and Barca fans are whiny bitches, so it's a perfect combo to get brain-dead takes.

Still don't get how people in this sub are more mad at RMA vids criticizing refs than they were at the blatant bribery and corruption with Negeira. But then again football fans aren't known for having standards."
It's absolutely a pen
that's one way to admit that you and your friends have 0 ball knowledge lmao
Oh well if your friends think that it must be true. Sorry to have questioned your friends impeccable judgment
"Meh, they're wrestling each other. Never going to get that."
Damn my strat of just looking at rüdiger if i dont notice who is the fouler didnt work for once
"Good one, man."
He wont be in that position to score if he didnt pull Ceballos the whole time
"So, two players wrestling each other? This is nothing."
"We can't be watching the same clip. Ceballos is out of position, and fouling to get the advantage. Ceballos initiates contact. Cubarsi grabs back. Cubarsi tries to separate and play the ball. Ceballos never tries to play the ball in this clip."
are you blind? they're both initiating the contact this happens literally every corner
In this universe. Because this is the universe where a Madrid player made the foul.
"When they’re uploaded with the title “Clear foul on Cubarsi not given” yes, imo."
"No doubt, but when you've got your arms around the defender it's hard for VAR to call this an obvious error."
"He doesn't just fall horizontally, he's damn near disrobed lmao

clear penalty"
This clip or a different one? He’s holding onto the guy then tries to stick his leg out and falls.gotta let go of the guy and make it clear you’re being hindered from making a play for the ball. Not playing patty cake with a defender
"""Stonewall"" pen that didn't get called, commentators didn't call out, and only Barca fanboys are upset about. Sure, buddy."
"He'd say he's trying to push defender away, which can only be done by physically making contact & yanking, pushing, making defender lose balance somehow."
RM player looks like he being pulled down bc he's pulling the barca player. It's that simple
lol yeah because the player whose jersey he's obviously pulling is tugging in the other direction
"Explain how pulling the defender towards you keeps you goalside??

That's not even to mention that putting all your eggs into the PK basket instead of a tap-in is really dumb."
Here’s one now.
"I guess you're right!  
I don't know what's up anymore"
Ceballos falls because hes pulled cubarsi onto him lmao
He gets jerked down from his own arms holding the jersey. Lol come on
first time?
"The point is one player was clearly impeding the other. Ceballos pulled Pau out of reach of the ball, saving a goal. Whatever grabbing Pau was doing at the beginning, it didn't prevent or impede Dani "
Exactly. Americans made Reddit. USA > World
yeah sure franco
It isn’t in the letter of the law but it is in the discretion of the officials and especially important in the decision of the foul. Both players competing for the position and being goal bound is the literal reason for the handling. If the attacker is already goal side of the defender it’s more apparent and more likely they’ll get the call and vise versa.
"why would he prefer holding his guy over scoring, clear pen"
"An American trying to lecture me about football, lol."
Good luck trying to talk logics to an illogical fan base. Cubarsi didn't even ask for a penalty no barca player protested and then you have fans watching from a tv 😂
'each other' is doing heavy lifting here. He's getting held back while trying to reach the ball. Just look at the jerseys of both.
They are not wrestling each other cebalos holds him by the collar while cubarsi tries to push him off. Why tf would cubarsi wrestle ceballos in this situation when he’s behind him?
cant argue with that until i see who initiated it first
"Dude just look at other angle, Cubarsi tries to push him away, he grabs his arm, Cubarsi had no reason to pull"
Not this obvious. It is penalty . Ceballos clearly pulls pau down from getting the ball
This is Draymond level of holding lmao
"Not that it matters at all, but even the extremely biased commentators on ESPN were shocked that it wasn’t called."
"But doing that would a foul, it doesn't matter what the justification is. And since they're both doing that the ref has not given the penalty."
Lol hilarious they basically volunteered themselves
"Should it be a penalty? Yes.

I can understand why a ref wouldn’t call it though.

As much as we all hate flopping, you still gotta make it clear to the ref you’re more interested in scoring than hugging your man."
"I don't know, someone should probably ask him that."
Great question.
sad when an American knows more about football than you lmaooo
"I mean, they are. Cubarsi is pulling to keep the defender from getting ahead of him. That woudl be a crazy weak penalty to give."
"Yes, we all see that, the problem is his arms are also around Ceballos. You could argue that Pau is preventing Ceballos from getting goal-side. When they're both holding eachother you can't make a call in ones favour."
You’re not guaranteed to get this call if you’re also instigating contact.
"It could be deemed similar to that dive/contact-avoidance attackers sometimes do and then don't get the foul but if they had just gone normally there is risk of injury even if then odds of getting that foul is higher.

Initiator should be judged on their actions. Rules allows for this. Unless the shirt/contact jossling is too uniform or hard to dissect.

In this instance that Uniformity condition isn't met. Cubarsi is being ragdolled and far more critically (Degree's aren't equivalent) prevented from reaching the ball to shoot on goal. 

In principle Cubarsi holding onto Defender is a bad excuse because it sabotages himself in that situation. Meanwhile there is no excuse for defender to STILL holding on to attacker in that goal-scoring position."
hahah - I'm not sure they can help it - I did say they were addicts to be fair
yeah someone should ask vasquez why he was pulling the attacker while being so confident the penalty won't be called
It started that way but Cubarsi wouldn't try to hold him after he saw the ball coming that way. I think he was at that point just resisting the pull to not fall down.
Clearly you aren't guaranteed without it either
"> It could be deemed similar to that dive/contact-avoidance attackers sometimes do and then don't get the foul but if they had just gone normally there is risk of injury even if then odds of getting that foul is higher.

I get that but in this case there was no risk of injury from letting himself be pulled and it would have made it very obvious who's at fault. I think players are just so used to pushing and pulling in the penalty area, of all places.

I can't see in the video who initiated it."
Tf is wrong with you 💀
"Someone should have reminded cubarsi that he wasn't defending this corner, and that if he'd simply let go of his man and turned around, he'd have had a tap in."
"Wow, and another."
someone should've watched the match

They'll struggle next year...right?
Would be incredible if Stockport went up as well. Those two are basically inseparable nowadays.
"Maybe they can do 4 in a row, but I don't see them doing 5"
"Absolutely, money helps. But you have to be impressed with Phil's (and other staff) work with the team"
"Unreal work. I know the Hollywood takeover is a divisive subject but 99/100 times, it goes wrong. 

The fact it's gone so well and ended up with 3 B2B promotions is ridiculous. 

Nice to actually see owners that care, attend matches and seem to get the fan base/town... Better than another Saudi backed club."
So roughly how much has the club increased in value by since they bought it? im guessing a lot.
From the National League to the Championship in 3 seasons is honestly insane. McElhenny and Reynolds have to be heroes to that community.
First? The Athletic haven’t seen my FM saves then.
"I don’t completely know how I feel about the financial model (and I suspect it can’t be repeated) but ultimately this is a club that in their last accounts were at about 40% wages to turnover.
They’ll probably have a kit deal as big as anyone in championship (if not in the top 10 in the country) next year.
They’re extremely well run. They’re spending more than other clubs because they’re earning more."
"Come on guys, spoilers... season 4 starts in like 3 weeks and you already spoiled the ending

  
XD"
"All in all a great achievement, but if I was a Premier League team, I’d be taking a look at Cleworth.

I think his ceiling might be really high and he’s still so young. He’s been with them every season since the takeover and each year he seems to outgrow the league he’s in at the end of the season. He even had an assist in the title decider this year.

I reckon that he probably is Premier League quality if given time. I don’t know what this guy earns at Wrexham however."
Nice. Let’s bring more competition upwards
"Absolutely incredible. Happy for them that they were able to lock it up before the final day.

I will say the League One playoffs are setting up to be incredible competition. Will absolutely be turning in"
"Nice to see them back strong, I saw their last European game live (Cup Winners Cup 1995 against Petrolul Ploiesti)."
"The Gang Can Do It On A Cold, Rainy Night In Stoke"
"Then they’ll be promoted to the prem to make it 4, then the super league for 5,  then the inteplanetary league, then the intergalactic league, then Inter dimensional league, so on and so forth until there is nothing left to conquer."
With an absolutely fantastic goal by Smith too! An incredible success story the fans will surely bore their grandkids to death with!
FUCKING YES!!!!
"Trigger all the UK fans upset about American Hollywood money in their football even though they are fine with middle eastern oil and Russian oligarchies, plus all the gambling advertising money"
Dream League soccer ass trajectory
It’s an awesome story
"Not exactly a fairytale when you buy the top scorer in division 3 while being in division 5. Their entire team was upper league one level 2 years ago. They've only improved their squad whilst rising so they really should expect to be where they are right now. 

Worse than Birmingham obviously but on par with the top league one sides. The championship will be a true test and if they go straight up, a real fairytale."
"Weird club with weirder fans. Lost two titles to Stockport and are only a few points ahead of us after throwing tens of millions at former Prem players. 

Now that the EFL’s PSR has teeth in the Championship, I expend them coming straight back down."
I just love the name. Like a fake porn movie title.
I’m so disappointed
Their new fans are annoying.
The Gang Win The Championship
They have the revenue of a mid table Championship team and that will only go up now so I wouldn't bet against them.
"They'll very likely struggle to go up.

They won't struggle to stay up. They'll be strengthened up enough that they'll be better than 17-21st in this seasons championship."
Never bet against Disney.
"We had a turnover above some championship clubs while in L2. The money is there to at least be able to avoid a relegation battle.

That said, anything above a midtable finish would absolutely beyond bonkers."
"They'll likely be mid table. But hey, it happened with Ipswich and they didn't have the same global pull that Wrexham have now."
Really don't think so. I'm betting they'll get relegated from the premier with like 15 points total
Holy hell they were in the conference with them weren't they
They really hate us
Wrexham to the Super League
Incredible if true
"There's a very good episode of the Tifo podcast with the guy who was the go-between Rob/Ryan and the football side. Really seems like they set up things with realistic expectations but also trusted the football people to make operational decisions. 


They'd said they expect being in the Championship in 5 or 7 years after takeover so getting there in 4 is an insane achievement."
"Money helped in first 2 promotions for sure, but they were not even that big of a fish in L1."
"When you want lower league promotion, you get Phil. He's really good at it"
"Money helps. But try doing that on FM. Sometimes you get lucky and get back to back promotions, but you usually need a season to get a team together to be good enough to win the league and be competitive in the league above. I don't think I could get 3 back-to-back promotions in a video game - to do it IRL is really impressive."
"I don't see any reason 'Hollywood takeover' should be more divisive than 'oil money takeover', or 'hedge fund takeover' which are *extremely* more problematic and very much more common.

It's just two comedians who love sport and they've shown nothing more than that."
">I know the Hollywood takeover is a divisive subject but 99/100 times, it goes wrong. 

What other Hollywood takeovers have we had that you were able to come up with 99/100?"
"So we’re apparently worth £100m according to Google, a far cry from the £2m Rob and Ryan bought the club for."
Any club could did this with their budget.
I assume they will get a lot more TV money? The Championship can be watched pretty easily where I live and I assume that a lot of countries in europe have access to the Championship.
Arthur Okonkwo (ex-Arsenal youth GK) is supposed to be pretty good too
"It’s not the money people are concerned about; it’s the absolute ignorance and stupidity of the American “fans” people are worried about. 

Just check out r/championship 

We had one guy who thought he was watching a live game, added loads of comments to our sub, when we asked wtf he was talking about it turned out he was watching a recorded replay from last year 😂

Or even this whole thread about Wrexham, England lol

https://www.reddit.com/r/Championship/s/Db87bGGAph"
"Nobody is fine with any of it. It’s all distorting the game to suit non UK fans and other countries.  People are triggered because our clubs have deep cultural roots in the community and success has even less to do with merit. It’s not a fairytale, it’s a cynical commercial manipulation that is pushing Wrexham ahead of other clubs driven by people who don’t give a shit about the game"
"> Now that the EFL’s PSR has teeth in the Championship, I expend them coming straight back down.

They're generating money though they aren't just throwing their owners cash at the club. They are using the fame of their owners to generate money."
And then they'll go back up over Stockport
"Good for you, bud"
The Gang Get Stabbed In Stoke
They're gonna Wrexham teams in there
Maybe they’ll struggle the year after…?
"I’m more interested in what their kit deal will look like than how they’ll do on the pitch. Games gone.

More seriously that deal alone might be up there with bottom half championship teams entire turnover."
"i would. Sure, in 3-4 seasons time I wouldnt but next season? They have to seriously invest in their squad now to make it promotion worthy to the premier leauge 


Steven Fletcher at 38 will get you goals in league 1 but he wont get you into the premier league"
Don't fuck with the mouse
what do you mean ‚we‘
"seems like there was a real bottleneck in the conference a few seasons ago. Teams that had fallen on hard times but pulled themselves together and were clearly too big for the division, but kind of had to form a queue to get out"
"Yep. Stockport went up to league 2 a year sooner after pipping them to conference premier title. Both came up last season from league 2, also stockport pipping them to the title. First time wrexham finished ahead in this little tussle the past few years travelling with each other up the leagues"
"It’s not called conference anymore; it’s called the National league

I found this out from a post that Chelsea was in the conference"
If you win the Premiere League you are promoted to the magical world of Greek Super League
look at the money birmingham spent. wrexham doesn’t even come close.
"They're one of the bigger fish but these days leagye 1 always has a fallen or sleeping giant and make no mistake in the grand scheme BCFC are big. Promotion was going to happen one day, impressive that it is at first attempt, had them pegged for playoffs, but now they'll be running through treacle."
Totally agree. The squad was for sure a league one squad. So a back-to-back-to-back promation was nothing I thought at the beginning of the season
Eh? They weren't? They have the 3rd highest wage budget in Leagur One by a considerable msrgin (£10.5 mil to £7.1 mil). Only Birmingham (£16 mil) and Huddersfield (£11.1 mil) were ahead of them. And predictably Birmingham ran away with the league with that budget. But Birmingham and Huddersfield were just relegated last season so their budgets make some sense being higher. Wrexham's is just plain financial doping given they were just promoted last season.
Yes they fucking were. They lost tens of millions in League Two and sighed so many former premier league players this season.
"He can also fit a lot of ""fucks"" into a sentence"
"Yeah it’s a spectrum with “wealthy sports loving actors” at one end, to “authoritarian regime sports-washing their image after dismembering journalists” at the other.

Of course it sucks when you see rival clubs get a big cash injection and leapfrog you. But Wrexham is the kind of ownership that I find it hard to get too annoyed about."
"Agree with that. Id love to see more personalities owning teams than conglomerates. We need more Delias, Eltons and Rob/Ryans

I guess it's more divisive in the ""they've bought their way there"" (from what I see anyway) than it being about the duo."
"I don’t think it would be more divisive.

An oil money takeover of a non league club pumping the club with money would see at least the same amount of people negative towards it"
"exactly, how the fuck is this even a conversation when we have literal countries buying clubs to sports wash"
two wrongs don‘t make a right
"How much have they invested after that? Just wondering what the profit is. Not a negative viewpoint, just curious."
"Yeh sure you are. Worth more than 90% of all other clubs, with fuck all history, fans and 4th division ground. Get real mate"
They're not even in the top 2 budgets in league 1 
"So there aren’t any idiots in all of UK? I know for a fact that isn’t true from my FPL leagues and my job.  wtf does that have to do with two actors buying a club in ruin then building it and the city backup?  You want to stop airing your matches outside UK then?  You don’t want that TV money?  The merchandise sales?  You want Liverpool to sell?  I ask again you are fine with City, Newcastle, prior Chelsea ownership though?  Or again is it just American money you are upset about?"
What a joke.  Wrexham’s owners are destroying the sport?  Do you think Wrexham fans are upset about those deep roots beyond destroyed by their stadium being rebuilt and their club they love being promoted 3 times?  Who says they don’t give a shit about the game?  Or the club? Or its fans?  Or the town?   Any club that was on tough times would have welcomed someone coming in and doing what they have for that club and town.  You’re just upset it’s Americans.
And they still lost tens of millions. Go read their public accounts.
I am. Having a great season with a massive win this afternoon
Probably. But one is natural and one is fake club like MK Dons.
“But can they do it (after getting stabbed) on cold rainy night in stoke?”
dang that one is good
The Gang win the Premier League
"Wrexham have beloved actors telling the story of the club, city, and its people through an Emmy award winning documentary. The club becomes beloved internationally with an audience that might not normally watch football. They have historic success with three successive promotions.

Sponsors are going to salivate to get a part of this continuing story. The deal will be huge."
"Bit of a difference between not struggling and promotion.

Yeah they won't go up next year, they will be safe though."
"You know well, if you're gonna call out people supporting clubs abroad don't do it to people who support their local club first. People can watch whatever football they want but it should be a priority to support local football to help the game everywhere which this lad does."
Needs to be 3 up instead of 2 up. The top 6/7 of the National League are on par with the lower end of League Two. That’s why there’s barely anyone that goes straight back down. League Two will never vote for that though
We queued for 15 years! Honestly that promotion felt the best
Chelsea is in the conference... league.
And they're 13 points behind. Not sure what a comparison to a relegated championship team achieves here.
"Other than Birmingham, and maybe Huddersfield, they spent the most. Their finances dwarf a lot of clubs in the league."
"Outside of us they spent the most though.

Well maybe Huddersfield did but they're an absolute shambles."
"“Lost tens of millions in League Two” “So many former PL players this season”

Do you know the club‘s financial report from last season(League Two)has been released, everyone could see it? The club repaid 15M loans owed to the owners then the loss is 2M. They were actually making money. 

The only 2 former PL players they‘ve signed this season are FREE AGENT Matty James& Jay Rodriguez in January."

"I don’t have a number but they’re investing in a new stand, with eventual plans to expand the whole stadium. They’ve also secured a permanent training ground for the club because we’ve been moving around between places for years. We’ve also got a new academy and a women’s team and a whole new fanbase from across the pond."
"One article I read said 11m. But keep in mind, they ( Rob and Ryan) make money of the series. Club doesn't."
From my understanding a billionaire pharma “minority owner” came in last year and they’ve had their investment paid back in full.
It's one of the oldest teams in the world and has plenty of fans around the globe
Are you high?
Bullshit. The accounts won’t be out until next April so how can you possibly know this?
"Come on that’s not what I said, fair play to Wrexham. I’d be delighted if I were a fan of them. It’s the wider trend that most people don’t like."
"[The full details have been released as Wrexham publish their accounts for the 2023-24 season, which saw the club make a £2.7m loss.](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce92zk757vlo)

That loss is also less than their previous accounts, amid ground and facility improvements. So they're clearly not doing too bad, eh?

From the same article, their revenue grew from ~£1m in the National League to ~£27m now.

Also, from [your club's own reports](https://www.stockportcounty.com/club-statement-annual-financial-report-and-statement/) you've lost £7m in the same period. Not sure you should be talking about losing money."
"With Vale just getting promoted to League One, and Stoke City 2 points above the relegation zone with a worse GD, they might not have to!"

"When you say “there’s barely anyone that goes straight back down”… has there *ever*, since automatic promotion was introduced in the 1980s (?) been a team that went up and came straight back down? At all?"
"yeah, I think I'm right in saying that since promotion (rather than 'election') to the football league has been a thing, I don't think anyone ever gone straight back down the next season."
It's been 4 for us so far and that feels long enough

It came to me in a dream 
"Alright so you want all foreign money out of EPL and English football in general?  At least that’s a more understandable position than being upset about Wrexham but turning your head at all the other clubs in each level.  There is a lot of foreign investment which has been happening for years some of which results in good management others not so good others bad.  I’m just tired of reading people shit on Rob/Ryan, Wrexham and USA in general many of those fans supporting clubs funded by foreign investment."
"Excuse me, I belive you dropped this: 🎤"
The Gang loses against Young Boys in the Final's
Can’t wait to see Vini Jr lose his head when he’s taken out by Dan Scarr.

I don't remember any having done so in the last 15yrs.
Fulham in 2017/18 and 2018/19 springs to mind? And I am sure there are loads more. Or do you specifically mean the Championship?
Don’t know how / why you’ve put Reading in this conversation. 18 points deducted over the past 5 years due to ownership financial problems.
"Wrexham's net spend was 3x higher than the next highest spenders sans Birmingham, with most teams who spent in the millions ending up positive after selling their players. Wrexham sold no one and spent £5m.

They've done extremely well but having lived through the crying about Salford buying their way through the leagues, seeing Wrexham do the same but get praised for it leaves a sour taste."
"Barnsley and Huddersfield are ran poorly with Reading being in a league of their own with ownership issues.

Our owner wants us to be ran more sustainably and having a fresh start which resulted in us selling 2 of our 3 best young players this season and releasing most of our experienced players on decent sized wages last summer.

Wrexham also spent the 2nd most in the league obviously behind Birmingham."
What’re you on?
You just stink of bullshit when you wake up then. Liar
"I literally called the trend of all outside investment distorting the league not just from the US. Personally I’d try and be a bit less precious about it. Genuine fans, ones tied to their clubs and attending matches have a right to not like financially doped monstrosities like Wrexham… as for Rob and Ryan ( weird you use their first names but hey) they are hardly saints. They are flexing their influence for personal gain as much as anyone. The reality is they might care about their investment in Wrexham but they  don’t give a shit about football in the UK."
They didn’t pay the troll toll.
In the last 15 years the closest has been Hartlepool that only spent 2 seasons up in League Two before they got relegated in the second one.
"Lmfao they're talking about the National League  
  
And you know literally the last 6 clubs promoted to the PL have gone back down too"
"Because they’re chatting bollocks about a topic they know nothing about, hence why they flagged Reading as a club with more financial resources than Hollywood FC"
Ok and yet their loss was 2.7M similar to Barnsley at 2.8. They aren't spending outside their means.
Salford’s owner is a nobend and you’ve also got scum like Ryan Giggs involved with them which made them particularly dislikeable
"3rd most*

And at a loss of $2m a season despite massive infrastructure spend this is actually fairly sustainable long term."
lol dude you need to take a chill pill 
">>*Nobody is fine with any of it. It’s all distorting the game to suit non UK fans and other countries.

It’s not a fairytale, it’s a cynical commercial manipulation that is pushing Wrexham ahead of other clubs driven by people who don’t give a shit about the game*  

You did not say that.  Your first comment in context with the thread and the comment you replied to certainly made it seem like you were singling Wrexham out at least to me, but your second comment says wider trend which I did take to mean that just confirming.  

How does someone go from not a fan to “genuine” fan?  They learn.  No fan even in the UK pops out of their mother understanding the sport, knowing their club’s history, etc.  I imagine there are also plenty of local fans who aren’t able to go to the matches but still care deeply about their team.  

And yeah sure they are doing it for profit, it’s a business after all.  Like every other owner they want their investment to pay off.  

Anyway as I said if your position is get all foreign money out fine.  I can understand that.  Of course it will have a negative effect on the quality of your clubs because the players and coaches want money.  The Saudi League is proof of that, the CSL and MLS as well to a lesser extent.  If you pushed all American money out of European football those players would likely just start going to foreign leagues earlier."
"You gotta pay the troll toll, if you wanna get into young boy's hole!"
Tiktok sponsor in league 2 when their competition is sponsored by Bob's Tiles
I don't care if you hate them for that.
Oh I looked at balance that was my mistake. Wrexham spent and lost 4.5m+ whereas Huddersfield were in profit for 650k+.
"
You need to stop lying on the internet for fake points. Weirdo."
You really don’t understand do you. The Premier League isn’t the richest league in the world because of American and Saudi investment ffs. They aren’t propping up English football.
"Lets add the fact, that not only they had enough money to buy better and more expensive players . Thanks to the tv show and owners Wrexham became a club players want to move to. Becauae its a PR machinę."
There’s only one person coming off as a weirdo in this exchange mate
Yeah you got me. The pathological internet liar for karma.
"Bro's a professional Wrexham hater XD.

Stay ignorant, stay mad."

I think this is the most unlikeable RM team since the Pepe/Mourinho years
"Finally, people are waking up to Rudiger. I remember in 2021 2022 he’s aggressive card worthy  challenges were sucked off so much by this sub"
"Man, how on earth do they let this guy do whatever he wants every game? The dirtiest scum I've seen in a very long time"
Vini with the negative IQ pass again
All that outrage paying off for rm
Looks like the refs had a bit of a warning note from Perez's camp prior to the match
Yamal is going to be killed before they get a yellow
This ref is scared shitless to make any calls against RM
"You can't expect the ref to do his job after he's been bullied shamelessly. Well done, VARdrid"
Played advantage so it negates the yellow card for SPA.
ITT: people don’t know the rules
"That's the problem with yellow card fouls leading to advantage play, most refs forget to give a card afterwards."
lmao fucking hell at least try and hide it
"I know there's a hate train going on towards Real, but this happens in every game."
Shouldn't the refs have stopped the game because his touch resulted in a loss of possession?
Shameless and they have the audacity to complain about the refs looks like all the intimidation tactics did work out after all
Shocker. Rudiger clatters people every game and gets away with it
Did the ref give advantage? If so it’s not a yellow
"Referree needs to grow a pair now, otherwise our players will be murdered before the match ends"
PR Offensive successful then
"Why would you give a yellow for that? 

It'd have to be for a tactical foul, which this clearly isn't given it doesn't stop Barcelona's attack."
Typical Madrid ffs
"Absolutely insane the things madrid got away with today, and the match is only half done. Well done madrid for manipulating an iconic game once again"
This isn't a yellow you donuts
"In spain rhe refs kinda dont ever give yellow cards if the let the game play on. Or at least 95% of the time, me and my friends talked about that bs like 17 times this season

Just la liga things no one can explain"
"Rüdiger with his second yellow card worthy foul (2nd one came a bit later)... he is such a violent thug... almost Pepe or Ramos levels. This guy plays so dirty, he deserves 2 yellows almost every other game, hate him so much when he pulls that shit"
Perez transfer went through as expected
"The audacity of this club. They were spared at least three confirmed yellow cards. They are still whining like babies, like they are the victims."
"How about his bodycheck in Olmo a bit later. All that week long crying, it certainly helped."
I fucking hate that cunt
And they had the outrage to run to the ref at half lmao
the ref was probably distracted by Vinicius berating him because his pass was intercepted.
"Yep, that was a yellow"
"Ref played advantage, so not a yellow. If he would stop the play it would be a yellow card. Talking as a referee and a neutral spectator. I don't give 2c about RM or Barca or Laliga for that matter."
"So many obvious fouls not given cards, looks like their little temper tantrum and fear campaign has nicely paid off. The ref looks frightened to call anything in opposition to them"
Bu bu but I thought the ref was against real madrid according to them
Lucas Vasquez and Rudiger with 0 yellow. That edge of the box tackle. Fucking shirt pull on Cubarsi. These turds have the audacity to cry about refs. Disgrace of a club.
Rudiger has already caused enough yellow-card offences to be sent off twice. Somehow not carded once so far.
He’s always been a roughhouser.
Damn the fact this is a trending highlight of the game shows how many Madrid hate watchers there are. This tackle has been happening on both sides the entire game.
Likes to pick on the smaller lads. He's about my size and would have had a good accidental elbow in the chops by now
"Genuinely, how does he keep getting away with this lol"
But I thought the refs were against them 🤡
Rudiger is what happens when human excrement comes to life
"let's hear it, madridistas. how is this proof of bias against Real Madrid?"
Some refs don't give a yellow if they give advantage.  Some do.
RMTV threats and blackmail worked.
"Is there some kind of reason why players from RM keep getting away with challenges like this? That's at least a yellow card

Surely it isn't just boil down to incompetence"
"All the bitching before the game is for sure paying dividends to Madrid now, they're no better than the fucking orange man, the same dirty tactics and lack of ethics. Shittiest of the teams"
"IFAB Laws of the Game: If the offence was interfering with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned. Referring to when advantage is played. More people need to learn this."
“Sit the fuck down”
not a yellow
Actually not a yellow. Tactical foul to stop a promising attack is a yellow but the fact that advantage was played means that the play wasn't stopped aka not a yellow
At least Mourinho brings fun shit talk to the table. These guys are just crying and acting like a Karen.
"Not even comparable, these are spoiled brats."
That cunt broke Kdb's face in the CL final.
Dude did this back in Germany already just on a lower level.
He played for us so I liked him simple as
"Pepe is the dirtiest, also RM player"
Tchouameni’s tackle against Olmo looked like a red to me. Insane it wasn’t reviewed by VAR
RM Heritage
it's in the shirt
He only have 3 yellow cards in La Liga.
Bastard could get away with murder on the pitch
Biggest scumbag since Pepe
Since Ramos? Not been that long unfortunately
Draymon Green effect
Because this isn’t a yellow card worthy tackle.. it would have been if he stopped the attack but ref plays on for the advantage so you’re not coming back to that for a yellow unless it’s much more serious
Tbf rudiger somehow manages to do this every game without getting a card so not sure you can pin in on this specific ref
People were really arguing that all of Real's screeching was going to backfire and make the ref be harsher on them. As if Real haven't done this so many times successfully already.
You bet it is
"Looks like the ref played advantage so he can’t book him for stopping a promising attack after that…

> If the referee plays the advantage for an offence for which a caution/sending-off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution/sending-off must be issued when the ball is next out of play. However, if the offence was denying the opposing team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour; **if the offence was interfering with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.**"
Paying off and Barca do go together.  How many millions over how many years did they pay again?
This type of foul happens dozens of times a game.
Legitimately looks rattled
he was playing advantage in this clip no?
"Nah dude, yellow every 3 fouls on him, won’t be long"
"They seem to be focused on killing Olmo, at least in first half."
"Because If advantage is given a yellow is only awarded if the foul merits it in its own, but not for stopping a promising attack"
"If it is only a yellow for being a tactical foul, the card can't be given if advantage was played. This was borderline but not necessarily wrong"
Exactly. Happens all the time.
"and it is a yellow every game, this wasn't even called as a faul lil bro"
He gave advantage
"no such rule

Edit: Realized people meant for the foul being tactical, not the foul in and of itself"
This isn't a yellow by the rules
It doesn't stop the attack out of luck. Unfortunately for Madrid it spilled in a way that allowed the attack to continue. Still appears to be a tactical foul and really should be getting a yellow. When I saw it in play I assumed the ref simply played advantage and would give the yellow later.
"How is it not lmao, completely forgets about the ball and just grabs and drops Olmo. Never talk about football again."
This isn't even a yellow ffs
"If it's the Fede one, cause that's his landing hand"
Wasn't the hand on the ground?
"He's breaking his fall, not a pen"
Yeah but the challenge itself deserves a yellow regardless of how the challenge affected the attack
"Just remembering that shit makes me angry. First he barrels into KDB with his shoulder, then he rolls around on the pitch holding his face as if HE had been fouled."
And Ramos... I'm starting to see a pattern
"but there was no VAR back then he got away with a lot, Rudiger does things more often even and VAR doesn’t say anything"
Pepe>Ramos>Rudi
Pepe became *better* over time with this shit; Rudiger’s doing the opposite.
Nah. He also got away with a lot of shit in Chelsea.
"Nah, don't you compare the triple single king to these players because they may be assholes but they're way beyond him talent wise."
"Mate, are you getting stuff out of your head? It doesn't matter if the ref gives an advantage"
Just watched rudiger elbow olmo in the chest and walk away w no card
"it's not a coincidence or a mystery. Casemiro, ramos, rudiger, lucas, if the refs were fair these players would be shown a red once every 3 games minimum but real players play with different rules."
He's Casemiro's heir
You would get scared when you home gets doxed your family gets abused you go on verge of losing your job
That’s not the rule.
"Then why were you guys crying because the ref didn't give a red card to a Espanyol player, only yellow, in that Game that your team claims It was a robbery? Mainly because of that red not given"
How many offside UCLs?
"Correct, however usually followed by a yellow card"
RUDIGER RATTLED
Advantage doesn't cancel out yellow cards.
"Yep. The refs Arms go up for advantage.

Pretty much no one in this thread understands the rules."
"This is the correct answer.  Read law 12.  If it was going to be a yellow for SPA, and you give advantage, then no yellow.  Yellow only given for advantage when the foul is reckless."
I mean it's pretty clearly an advantage given by the ref. But he 100% should've given the yellow once play stopped
"It is not - I know there is outrage here, but these type of fouls aren't yellow every game. If it woud've been, we would've not watched 90m - games would've been finished with forfeit by min 60..

  
Maybe you should watch some premier league, some serie a :)"
"He played advantage, which negates the yellow card"
foul* kiddo.
"It’s a yellow if the tackle merits it, but not for stopping a counter"
If its a tactical fouls and the ref plays advantage then yes
Yes there is
"Mate, you have Liverpoool flair. Premier league has 20 interventions like this per game.

La liga + the outrage now against RM - everything is minimum yellow."
"> It doesn't stop the attack out of luck. Unfortunately for Madrid it spilled in a way that allowed the attack to continue.

So it doesn't stop a promising attack, i.e. it's not a yellow for a tactical foul."
"Ref played advantage, its only a yellow if the foul merits it but you can’t give a yellow for stopping a counter attack there"
"https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/fouls-and-misconduct/



""Advantage
If the referee plays the advantage for an offence for which a caution/sending-off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution/sending-off must be issued when the ball is next out of play. **However, if the offence was denying the opposing team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour; if the offence was interfering with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.**""



Still think you're right?"
"Well, you know what, gattuzo was dirty as well, but at least, he was getting booked. This guy elbows at least 5 times a game, and he finishes with one card at best"
Just look at how little Casimero got carded at madrid then his utd stunt.
And Casemiro
Oil clubs and oligarch clubs are less of an embarrassment for the sport than Real Madrid
"Hierro, Sanchís.. RM defneders have a long history of violence."
VAR can't intervene unless it's a red card challenge iirc?
That's why Madrid acquired him
"For tactical fouls (stopping a promising attack), no yellow card is given if advantage is played."
"Literally you are so confidentially wrong. Please look up laws of the game. 

The sanction is administered at the next stoppage; if the offence was denying the opposing team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, the player is cautioned; if the offence interfered with or stopped a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.

Straight from IFAB."
No pen given for Ceballos hug on Cubarsi either
"Yes it is.

> If the referee plays the advantage for an offence for which a caution/sending-off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution/sending-off must be issued when the ball is next out of play. However, if the offence was denying the opposing team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour; **if the offence was interfering with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.**

So few people actually know the rules when moaning about referees. Standard on here though."
"I genuinely don’t know what you’re talking about to be honest, I’m a Chelsea fan and can’t remember watching any Espanyol games for years."
They changed the rules
"No it doesn't. This is a basic foul. If he wrapped Olmo up and purposely stopped him without trying to get the ball, yes it's stopping an attack and an automatic yellow. That isn't what happened. Rudiger moved up to play the ball and missed."
"Read the post title buddy, no one's discussing the advantage rule, the question is whether this was a yellow card offense which it absolutely was. Cynical foul + tactical, takes player out of a dangerous counter"
">Pretty much no one in this thread understands the rules.

I don't think you understand basic english.

People are complaining about Rudiger not receiving a yellow card, it's in the title."
You’ve missed the point of the post entirely
"Not anymore. If advantage is given, you do not go back and give a caution."
"you are right, missed that. however there is a very angry Arsenal fan chasing my every comment telling me that this is never a yellow. weird"
"This is even a 2 minute penalty in ice hockey, what the fuck are you yapping about."
"We're also just 15min into the game, it's common to give out a warning or two before carding someone. I understand that Real is the most hated team in this subreddit, but god damn are people hyperbolic."
that's... not how it works at all? you can yellow card the player after
"You got me so good. A sentence starts with a capital letter, by the way."
"I actually thought people meant for the foul in and of itself, not by virtue of being a tactical foul."
Don't argue - reddit soccer don't know the rules. It's RM so everything should be yellow.
"Completely forgetting about playing for the ball, charging into another player doesn’t merit a yellow? Lmao."
"Yes? The yellow is because of the action itself, it has nothing to do with the opportunity and how clear it was or not. 

He completely disregarded the ball, ran into another player to take him down and just bashed him lmao, how are you so unbelievably oblivious."
"Impact of the foul significantly weakened a very promising attack, Yamal had to check his forward run, Olmo's forward directionality was completely halted by the foul. W/o Rudiger's foul it would've been 4 Barca shirts against 3 Real defenders. Ultimately counter ended with 2v3 in Real's favor.

If the advantage is attempted but not fully successful in neutralizing the impact of the foul, Ref can issue the yellow card."
Tbf some of his red at UTD are bs like grabbing someone's collar 😆
They’re spoiled brats but some of those sportswashing projects are steeped in blood. Definitely different levels here
Idk. Oil clubs are based on killing & blood. Not sure this is true.
Let's not go too far now.
"Dude, your club had the refs on the payroll"
Ruggeri was a dirty motherfucker
"You’ve highlighted that part as if that means anything relative to what Rudiger did. You can “interfere in a promising attack” and still commit a challenge that warrants a yellow after the advantage has been played. It doesn’t grant immunity to the player.

That rule is moreso for situations where a petty foul may be committed that otherwise had large implications; if the player, or another can get their shot off, or chance created then obviously he doesn’t need to be booked.

But grabbing a player, pulling shirts, diving in etc. on the counter and advantage being played after doesn’t mean you can’t be booked."
"No, it isn't."
You're absolutely correct and the downvotes just show how clueless everyone is
"These people are absolutely insane mate, they've lost their heads.  There's no speaking to them lmao"
It was a professional foul on a break. 100% ocean avenue.
Seriously? When did that happen?
"The ref is still supposed to for any reckless challenge, only no booking if it was just a professional foul like shirt pulling"
"Ok, so I don't normally waste time with kids like you that watch ""soccer"" on tiktok, but. This foul wasn't a tactical foul, wasn't stopping any attack and wasn't a repeated offence, therefore according to IFAB itt falls under unsporting behaviour. Now, here is the paragraph from IFAB regarding this:

**Cautions for unsporting behavior** include (among others):

* **""committing a foul or handling the ball to interfere with or stop a promising attack""**
* **""committing a foul which interferes with or stops a promising attack, except where the referee awards a penalty kick for an offence which was an attempt to play the ball""**

Go back to hockey then, or maybe watch some premier league/serie a before talking about refereeing.

And for you: [https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/fouls-and-misconduct/#disciplinary-action](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/fouls-and-misconduct/#disciplinary-action) \- Section 12.3. Enjoy the reading. Althoug I know here facts aren't really appreciated. You can bring your tiktok friends to downvote, I don't care about internet rating LOL. But maybe maybe one of you will actually read the fucking laws before commenting about what's a foul or not a foul."
"It’s in black and white in the rulebook that the offence of stopping a promising attack isn’t a yellow card if advantage is given to the team that was fouled. The challenge would need to meet other yellow card criteria, like being reckless, to get one per the rules."
"Yes it is. Check the rules, they explicitly say you don’t book them"
"Oh, yeah you can still give a yellow if it’s warranted as a stand-alone foul, not too sure this one would be tho imo"
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA the victim complex by the - my a massive margin - most historically favored by refs team is hilarious. Pathetic.
"If it hadn’t happened in the context of a counter attack, would it have been a yellow? I’d think no, it’s something that happens fairly often"
Definitely weren't aware of the advantage rule and instead of acknowledging it you're doubling down 🤡
Wait is the ref supposed to consider all of those factors?  Lmao
half as many as he deserved
Seeing this game well I would say the ref is on no payroll and if so he's more on your payroll but yeah keep bringing that up when your club profits so many times from ref decisions especially your CBs who kinda always are spoken about to be dirty players.
"Like a parrot, never misses a beat."
"Head of the association that assigns referees, and it's been proven there was no sporting benefit"
show me the receipts or stfu
"> he can’t book him **for stopping a promising attack** after that…

is what I said, highlighted the important part for you

> That’s not the rule.

Is what you said. I highlighted the only relevant bit to correct you."
"Yes, it is. 

Unless you have anything that contradicts the black and white passage from the laws of the game I quoted?"
"You aren't ""denying a promising attack"" if they're still attacking promisingly. Very dumb rule.

They should still go back to give a yellow card if there is a reckless foul or whatever"
It’s been a few years but don’t remember exact year of change.
"Right, that was not reckless. That’s SPA"
"There is no winning against ignorance, just ignore and move on. Kiddo probably just started watching football two weeks ago."
">wasn't stopping any attack

what"
telling me to watch Premier League to understand refereeing is like telling me to watch Andrew Tate to understand feminism
"yes, it was reckless. next."
you are an Arsenal fan I am not listening to you man
"# Advantage

If the referee plays the advantage for an offence for which a caution/sending-off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution/sending-off must be issued when the ball is next out of play. However, if the offence was denying the opposing team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour; **if the offence was interfering with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.**

[https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/fouls-and-misconduct/#disciplinary-action](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/fouls-and-misconduct/#disciplinary-action)

Advantage was played, attack continued, therefore the player is not cautioned.

Read the fucking rules kiddo before commenting about ANYONE being favored. You first need to know the rules before saying that X/Y was favored or not. **Knowledge is power.** ""By a massive margin"" you are incompetent and can't read/understand some crystal clear rules. But, as any kid here, you just trash talk with 20 iq and 0 knowledge about what you're talking about."
What? Of course it would lmao
"Yes, it would have what are you smoking, dude? He just charges into a player with the only intention of taking him down, how’s this even a question…?"
"Yes, I wasn’t aware of a basic rule. That’s totally it."
barging a player down on the counter-attack is pretty glaring factor to consider.
"And you think Barça doesn’t? Both teams benefits from those mistakes. I don’t like, at all, the approach Florentino has taken, it’s embarrassing"
"Well, it’s a fact."
Who proved that? Because they spent 2 years without a pen against them
They are at the court and on your finances
"No but that’s not the rule. You’ve confused the rulebook with your application with what happened here.

If I randomly flipped open a book of listed laws and pointed to one, and insisted it was real… That has as much relevance as what you’re doing.

I’m not disputing it’s “a” rule. It’s just not the rule here."
"Are you referring to the attack that just happened when Yamal passed the ball due to advantage being played?

There's a section in IFAB for that as well.

# Advantage

If the referee plays the advantage for an offence for which a caution/sending-off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution/sending-off must be issued when the ball is next out of play. However, if the offence was denying the opposing team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour; **if the offence was interfering with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.**

  
So, due to being played advantage, the attack continued, therefore the player is not cautioned anymore. I'm explaining it to you cause according to Eurostat 2022, 41% of the Europeans can't read but can't understand what they read. And here on this reddit I think it's well over 80%."
Yet you're telling people to watch hockey to understand refereeing a different sport 
No it wasn’t
"And you’re a moron, the rules say it pal"
"You are copy pasting someone else's comment because you are barely able to breath with all the foam in your mouth, clown. 

The action would have been a yellow on its own. Whether it was a clear situation of goal or not (it wasn't) is not the reason this should have been a yellow. 

Please never talk about football again, you are obviously a blind fan that knows absolutely nothing more than ""my team is right"" so stop wasting my team. Don't reply again, please :)"
"I wouldn't blame someone for not knowing the particulars of some of the rules, you're allowed to admit it, no need to be a cunt when you're shown to be wrong."
"So why list all those other things that are completely irrelevant in considering whether to give a yellow or not?   This is crazy, everyone is just making up rules to suit themselves haha"
Any official proof?
So what offence are you wanting Rudiger booked for? You cannot seriously be suggesting it’s a reckless challenge that he’s made.
I'm refering to the very video we're commenting on. Seems like you can't see with your eyes. Huh.
you did not get the point and that's fine. gold star for trying
"I'm copy pasting the fucking rule which I even gave you the source, not someone else's comment. So eurostat 2022 is actually acurate, 41% of the europeans can read but can't understand what they read.

It's in the fucking rule that if advantage is played the player that commited the foul is not cautioned, yet you still have a big mouth. Fucking internet era, gave power to all 20iq kids to trashtalk without any consequences."
"you've just confused yourself by reading LMAO. Had Rudger just pulled Olmo down by the shirt taken him out of counter, no one would've blinked an eye on the yellow despite advantage.

He took Olmo out of counter-attack unfairly, it was a yellow all day LOL."
The payments to the reff are recorded in the clubs finance reports
"If you link the document you’ve been looking at I’d be more than happy to, to ensure we’re singing from the same hymn sheet."
"Ok, let me ask you a basic question - advantage has been given and the attack continued with Raphina? If yes, then there's no caution to the player that commited the foul accordint to IFAB rules. Would've not been given an advantage? Then yes, yellow if would've been classified as ""stopping an attack"". 

[https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/fouls-and-misconduct/#disciplinary-action](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/fouls-and-misconduct/#disciplinary-action)

Enjoy the reading - hope you understand what you read."
Was the point that your brain doesn't have the capacity to know the sets of rules for two different sports?
"Are you dense? I acknowledged what the rule said, told you it has absolutely nothing to do with the reason for why it should have been a yellow and you seem unable to comprehend that. 

Maybe it's time for a reading comprehension class? Don't waste my time again, please. Bye!"
So why mention the other irrelevant shit 😭
It's the IFAB Laws of the Game.
it's clearly written even in football rules that this is a yellow
"Ok, so you confirmed you have 20 iq, but maybe you still have a chance?

Was a foul? Yes. Advantage has been played and attack continued? Yes.

Then the rule states clearly - ""**if the offence was interfering with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.**""

**=** no yellow according to the rules because advantage has been played and attack continued.

Want me to draw? Maybe images are better for you. Do you need a flowchart?

  
1️⃣ **Foul occurs** → Was the foul committed to stop a promising attack?

* ➡️ **Yes** → Go to step 2.
* ➡️ **No** → No yellow card.

2️⃣ **Referee plays advantage** → Did the attacking team **continue a promising attack**?

* ➡️ **Yes** → No yellow card needed.
* ➡️ **No** → Yellow card must be shown at next stoppage."

(He also has 51 caps for his NT.)"
Don't think the conclusion should be that he is the one getting them relegated. He wouldn't be signed if he was. This is just his level.
"He’s actually an excellent player. Would smoke most players in American leagues and many in Europe. Just getting bought by clubs with bad plans and shit defense.

I watched him play against Real Betis Thursday night. His movement was quite good but they didn’t have enough of the ball. Some good crosses that maybe he should have been on the end of but really can’t blame him when you concede 5 goals. Teams at that end of the table live and die by their defense. The Forward needs to come up clutch against the teams around you but if the defense isn’t up to snuff you’re dead already. 

He could probably beat your Sunday league team 1v11."

"I think Ampadu had 3 consecutive relegations across different countries even. Sheffield United, Venezia, Leeds"
It's almost as if it isn't his fault only that those teams were relegated
"Not really, he leaves teams that go down and joins teams that are in the 1st division, only to go down again"
He stays in 1st div where he probably earns more than in 2nd div
"2 divisions up, playing against alien in the galactic division?"
Only if they multiply ಠ‿↼
Or straight to league one
"Yeah. Like signing  new contract with Valladolid after they went down, so than he can get back to La Liga, to go  back to segunda.

He is 32. He knows his level and wants to play at top level. But he never was a starter in any of his last 4 clubs. 
At this point as a winger you know you dont have much time to earn money.

Edit: oh he actually didnt need to sign any contract with Valladolid he just got loaned to Cadiz."
"> but he'd get less money

Be real then, it's not really a choice is it?"
That's a very defeatist attitude
Never know until u try
Man City are a honorary La Liga club with us facing real Madrid at least twice every season
"He’s only 26, plenty of time left to break that record"
And they're behind Hermann Hreiðarsson with 5. Been relegated with every PL club he played for.
"ramsdale has 4, one is relegation from league two"
"maguire has 5 if you count nations league, and one of the few (only?) with 2 in one season"
ADHD lives matter
"It's not that rare (at least in Spain) to have these kinds of players that are too good for most teams in the second division, but too bad for most teams in the first. Their typical place is to either stay in the tops of the second, or the bottoms of the first, and they accumulate a lot of promotions and/or relegations."
"It's also a special psychological skill to be able to go out on the pitch to publicly caned every week.

For him it's gone wrong a few times, but you have to have the right character to be able to do it."
I don't think he's bad.
I would dare you to find a Venezuelan who doesn't like him. He always puts work for the NT.
"Like I said, if you or I played with or against him, he'd be amazing."
I didn't think that he's getting them relegated in and of himself lol
"""He could probably beat your Sunday league team 1v11.""

That's what I'm saying."
"Yeah, my interpretation of a mercenary would be someone that’s bought to win. So bought to keep a team up facing a relegation battle. That’s what I’m thinking though."
Why do you assume the aliens would be the in better division smh. I personally don't rate using superpowers to play footie
"Only to find out they're actually Japanese high school kids who got exposed to a radioactive meteorite.

But hey they can conjure black holes out of nothing..."
Playing Galatik football against the Wambas
Yea. This guy is not in the Salah “oh the difference in that money has no effect on the lives of me and my family” tier. This is the difference between you and your lineage being wealthy and having to budget your earnings for your entire life.
"Well you see, the Mansour financial group.."
"Oh I was just looking at relegations from the Premier League. I bet if you look at lower leagues, there's a player with a hilarious number of relegations"
Won't even have to be too bad. No idea how good he is but not like an average la liga quality player is enough to stave off relegation for a bottom side
Myrto Uzuni
"Or go to non top 5 league first division teams like Ajax, Feyenoord, Benfica etc. With European comps as benefit"
"Machis is disliked(as a player) by a lot of people, they say he doesnt do shit with the NT, similar to how they talk about Yangel, but tbf, not many players shine with the NT"
Machis was plenty hated after that Paraguay game
"There was an NBA player who was being criticised and summed it up quite well: ""I'm closed to LeBron than you are to me""


Anyone consistently playing in the top European leagues is in the top 0.001% of players worldwide, and we sometimes forget it."
"It’s not superpowers tho. at least not anymore than human abilities are. just regular degular alien abilities trained to the max

frankly wishwashy, if you have that kind of covert exophobism, I’d like you to leave my subreddit"
This is about being able to put bread on the table for the rest of your life. 
">and your lineage

This is everything wrong with the world. When millions are starving, others stuff money away for their great great grandkids"
Mate you can't support a financial group.
"Ferencvaros Legend,what's up with him?"
I  dont see a ''too bad for la liga'' type player to feature much in Ajax and benfica exc. Maybe midtabler teams in such leagues
"I mean in the recent times with the 1 year+ of not winning, yeah, everybody is a little disliked except Rondon (and I have seen very ungrateful comments against Salo even). But Machis has always been mostly liked on his NT career before this last stretch.

I have been disconnected a little from Twitter and Facebook recently tho, a lot of pessimism whenever people talk about La Vinotinto."
"This is the point i was trying to make. 
We as spectators see a stat like this and can think how poor a player is when, in reality, they'd be the best player you ever played with or against if you had the chance. 
Same thing with someone like Mudryk getting made fun of, but he'd be so much better than the people making fun of him."
">frankly wishwashy, if you have that kind of covert exophobism, I’d like you to leave my subreddit

I've been brainwashed by Hollywood propaganda, sadly"
Don’t think it’s that. Difference between ~6 million euros and 2.
Oh Boy do I have news for you
could easily be the backup there
"Soteldo is still liked as well, and Aramburu and Romo arent ever going to be disliked after their Copa America 2024 even if they play bad(not that Romo ever does)"
"Not sure about nachis in particular. Maybe he could. But, i was talking in general about ''these kinds of players that are too good for most teams in the second division, but too bad for most teams in the first.'' that ASuarezMascareno mentioned"
It's hilarious how Soteldo is even shorter when you see him on a stadium live
Wavin' Flag was robbed.
"Fun random fact: for some weird reason, kid me used to listen to this song on loop while playing the browser game ""Transformice."" Those two completely random things are now 100% linked in my brain, can't think of one without thinking of the other."
Fucking banger btw
"Waka Waka hits me right in the feels man.. Nostalgica as its finest.

Wavin Flag was good too, what a year."

What a dog shit song
"Blatantly racist, with the fake “African” lyrics."
It's the people's anthem that's for sure
"Still my WC 2010 anthem. 

Akon also made a banger for Pepsi."
It was a pretty great song.
The original version of [Wavin' Flag](https://youtu.be/awbmTxD7sMM?feature=shared) makes me want to enlist in a global revolution.
">Those two completely random things are now 100% linked in my brain, can't think of one without thinking of the other.

"Some addendums:

* Two finals and winners are recognised for 1910 and 1913.
* The 1909 final was won by *Club Ciclista de San Sebastián*, using players from the newly-formed team Real Sociedad which was not officially founded until later that year.
* *Racing de Irún* merged with *Irún Sporting Club* in 1915 to form Real Unión."
It's wild that Madrid have lost more finals (21) than they've won (20).
There’s something sweet about the fact that the Catalan and Basque clubs have won the King’s Cup (known as the Supreme General’s Cup during Franco’s regime) more than the ‘royal’ club from the capital.

"Feels like a skit 

Group A- going to a party

Group B- going to a funeral"
"subs gonna be full of this today lol, not suprising"
Almost a bit too on the nose lol
Fans know they are going to see a massacre.
"Barça fans chanting ""madridista que no boti eh, eh""

/r/soccer : why Madrid fans don't jump?... lmao"
I am reminded of that meme of a guy looking out the window to the right and seeing a great view and a guy looking to the left and seeing a cliff.
"Is the game today?

Edit: so many comedians here"
"I've been to that train station, fun fact there's a Kansas City entrance because Sevilla is a sister city to KC where I live."
After all this it will be pretty embarrassing if we don't win lol
"*accumulates snacks* 

Popcorn, anyone?"
Let’s hope Barca fans are still celebrating like this on the way home
"Why is the club acting like this !? Fans, board  ? 

You are in the final of a cup. Granted its not champions league but it is prestigious and you are facing your biggest rivals."
"Man i'm feeling very bad about this.  
Every time the fans were this confident the players dropped total stinker on the pitch.  
please Prove me wrong Barcelona."
Damn look at the Madrid fans
Real Madrid fans vibe is like they are going for a funeral.
 “Cules”and “Madridistas” that don’t speak Castellano or Catalan in this thread is the least surprising thing on earth…. They are literally saying if you don’t jump you’re a madridista
"I like how one scene is derivative for all the fans. I rode in the metro with RM fans and they were cheering, singing whatever. But sure..."
You can tell by the energy who is confident and who is not
Some one say what they chanting eh
Hopefully no “Vinicius Die” chants this time.
"If this is RM fans before the match, how will they be after the 90th min😂

Edit: 120th min"
Madrid fans scared
Love it! Viva Barca!
"Watched last 2 clasico.

Where barca scored 4 goals in 2 games.


Hoping this time it's not the same result."
"Idk why they are sad the got Kylian Mbappe, vini Ballon dor, rodrigo, Bellingham, Valverde they got a galactico squad"
"Only just read about Real's referee antics. What a bunch of arrogant, entitled cunts. Hope Barca smash them!"
This is war
I think I'm gonna hit the gym early
Anyone knows any free internet sites to watch the match...?
"Bruh, they are weak af."
How could the refs do this to them
Hey all I’m saying is It would just be nice to public transport in the usa
"Madrid fans are trash win or lose. Have you seen their home games, they need to beg to close the roof to have a decent atmosphere. It's dead otherwise.

Madrid stand for nothing other than outspending the competition and winning, quite a soulless club when you think about it."
"I mean they are shouting ""Madridista qui no boti"" which means ""Whoever doesn't jump is a Real Madrid supporter"". Everyone is acting according to the chant's instructions!"
Record a 30 minute second with no context. Classic social media sludge.
They’re all too annoyed at the refs
How could the referee do this to them.
Hope it's the same on their way back
El Plastico
"That's what 3 knockouts from  Europe league can do to a team fans! 
RMs didn't even celebrate the 15 th CL title.."
"typical madrid fans, all day trippers"
Madrid fans don’t care much bout a copa del ray trophy… we don’t have enough room for all the trophies so the copa del rays end up in some local pub somewhere to be shown. There is levels to this and Barcelona isn’t just there
It’s always a big day for Barca fans playing Madrid. We don’t care about copa del rey so let them dance
I have a feeling the match is going to feel exactly like that.
Real Madrid knowing referees won’t help POV
Because it is. 9-2 over two matches. Watch it be 14-2
Barsa fans are chanting if you are not a Madrid fan start jumping. So yeah Madrid fans are not going to jump
Amd we’ll be there to witness
Honestly I do miss days when El Classico was such a huge event
"Oh no, we can’t talk about Ipswich vs Nottingham Forrest today and you lot actually have to pay attention to a la liga game…. Bummer 😒"
"Want to see something funny? Go to Barcelona's biggest fan account on twitter, go back to Mar 19, 2023 and you will see a picture of tonights referee holding his phone on Camp Nou, that has a phonecase with Messi in a barca shirt. Interesting.


Edit: ohhh the downvotes are coming in, people didnt like that fact."
Nah they’re just embarrassed by the behaviour of their club
"I'm surprised it isn't the ""fill de puta qui no boti"" one"
So a Spanish bouncy basically?
In Spanish or Catalan?
Was that before or after they were chanting die Vinicius?
"Yet to see a single person suggest that they should chant with them, what is your point?"
lot of madrid fans are plastics
That’s exactly it.
We just lost 5-0
Nah Next month. That’s the reason the fans already arrived you know ?
In 5 minutes 
In 7 hours.
Next year i think so
Sister city in what context?
"Not really. I am glad we are excited and supporting our players. Even if we lose, at least we did try"
It’s called passion and there’s nothing wrong with cheering for your team. You haven’t set yourself free yet huh? Always concerned about how others perceive you?
"Why, cause the fans are excited for the game. Barca didn’t even mention RM and beating them at ALL. 

Lets the game start, we do our talking on the pitch. Win or lose Barca will put on a show."
How is supporting team embarassing. Fk off bro. This isn't like the 'remontada' gimmicks Real Madrid tried.
"We are playing Madrid when we have crucial players missing, after playing an insane amount of games + they have the added vengeance of needing to win this trophy more and proving they are not going to roll over every time, I am terrified I am not sure why everybody is celebrating tbh 

P.S. plus with the shit they pulled off wouldn’t be surprised refereeing wise this game goes for them"
"Why should we? It's not our fault that Real are pathetic crybabies beforehand, but during the actual game they are very much still opponents on our level..."
Nah you guys come out on top no matter what imo. Unless there’s some serious backtracking this will affect RM’s reputation for years potentially - it’s previously unseen heights of cringe.
That’s all I keep thinking. 😭
"Yeah sure I'll have some.
*Offers nachos*"
Agree to disagree
Nah fuck no
"To be fair, Barça fans are basically chanting ""Madridista qui no botí"" which means ""Madridista the ones who don't jump""."
"They are chanting ""Madridista the one who doesn't jump!""

  
I mean, it's a classic, you can't jump in that moment."
Madrid has been in near free fall the last few weeks so I don't think many fans are very hopeful rn
"I've been enough times in the Bernabeu to know Real Madrid fans only support the team when they're winning. Florentino made the ""animation tier"" in the south end of the stadium to avoid that, if people there don't cheer for the team they get their (big discount) passes revoked. But after Ultras Sur got banned and before the ""animation tier"" was created, the stadium was almost silent unless someone scored for the team.

Also, they've been butchered by Barcelona a few times recently so this adds a lot."
"they are 2-9 vs barca this season over 2 legs, bottled a league lead of 9 points over barcelona and got knocked out of ucl I do not blame them"
Fans act like this because they know they are gonna lose probably.
Money can't buy morale
"Club with no soul, fans are there for clout."
"I'd like to see an accurate census of this sub someday, because tbh it often feels like a Barcelona sub. Not that RM isn't obviously shitting the ball lately, but it definitely comes off quite a bit biased and centered around these two clubs lol"
"One side is waiting for a metro, the other is moving somewhere. But the narrative fits so yeah... RM cans are the worst blah blah"
something along the lines of 'the ones who are not jumping are madridista'
"I have a bad feeling they're gonna win and the last couple days will be as good as forgotten. I've seen this awful script before.

Anula Mufa tho"
Some of us have been on suicide watch for a lot of this season...so y'know nothing much will change 😂
"Tbf these fans going by train will be from Madrid, not from abroad, hence not the plastics."
Cared enough to comment.
Written by somebody who knows they are going to get smashed
"> We don’t care about copa del rey so let them dance

[You sure about that, buddyboy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_8s1cIrF_I) This was after only winning the cup."
"Yet it is your most likely, and perhaps only, chance of silverware this season. Take this seriously and have faith in your team, that's my advice."
Yes ofc President of RM
"Maybe you don't, but Real Madrid sure does"
"This sub is way too convinced that Barca will walk over them. Yeah Barca is better overall and *should* win in a perfect world, but it's still Real Madrid and a dirty Clasico game. RM will have plenty of chances and anything can happen.

Edit: Bookies have roughly 45% Barca win, 35% RM win. Really not that far apart."
Aged like haut brion
I'm actually worried the ref is going to be too careful and not card RM.
I guess everybody’s forgotten that Barca paid the head of the ref committee for years…? How after that Madrid are linked with the refs more than barca is beyond me but whatever floats the boat.
Referees are in the pockets of Barca anyways. You'll see in the semi finals
"We were losing regardless, just increased our chances if anything"
"Even as relative neutrals, it's way easier to sympathize with Barca as well compared to the absolute pricks at Madrid 🤷"
"Sure its not Messi v Ronaldo anymore but i think these last few years it has picked up again with Real's ""galacticos"" and Barca's insane young talent"
"It's still huge. At least in Spain, Madrid and Barcelona could both be playing in the second tier and El Clasico would still be the most watched match of the season."
"It still is man, what are you talking about"
bro idk why you're telling me this. i'm not complaining and my flair isn't even english. I'm just pointing it out
">Go to twitter

I'd rather not"
Wanna see something funnier? [This](https://amp.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2017/02/27/58b413e5268e3ec27b8b4661.html) is the Supercopa final referee leaving a match with a Real Madrid bag and merchandise.
Bro said some shit out of his ass with no proof while the literal president of the league proudly says he's a Madrid fan lmao
"referees tend to be football fans. Football fans tend to like the greatest player of all time. Besides the literal president of the league is a diehard madridista lmao, if you wanna bring up conflict of interest"
You could have just posted the link
Just going to ignore that the league president is a madrid fan yet bitch about getting downvoted.
Well I'm one of the fans.
"Did you see Twitter Madrid yesterday? I know they are not all the fanbase, etc etc., but it's a big sample."
Is that a CE Europa flair I see?
"Afaik Barça fans tend to chant more the first one, rather than the one you mentioned."
"Catalan*

""Madridista qui no boti""

= Madrid fan if you don't jump."
Definitely after they chanted for Lamine to go sell handkerchiefs
every top club have plastics
"I think when you talk about clubs as big as Real or Barca, there will be fans you will consider as ""plastic""."
The ones travelling to Sevilla to watch their club in the CdR final are not the typical problematic plastic gloryhunter fans.
Feels like 7 days…. I can’t wait anymore!
wdym it's just halftime
halftime just over bruh
"There is a shopping district built to resemble Sevilla in KC and idk, like all sister cities some Mayors get together and declare it and it sticks.
 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giralda_(Kansas_City)

In Sevilla airport there's also a big ass mural that says Ciudad de Kansas."
"This. 

Why shouldn't you be happy and chant going into a Cup final?!?! Just because you could lose? No way! You can win or lose. Always. Enjoy the moment (Ronaldinho dixit)"
"Exactly this. I remember going to watch Arsenal v Blackpool in the Prem, we beat them 6-0 and they were singing and going mad the whole game."
Why wouldn’t y’all be excited and supportive? Y’all bout to beat us for the third time this season
Corny ass mf ik u gonna be embarrassed either way
How to do this brother?
"Bro stop being jordi alba, we’re going to kick their ass!!!!"
Blaming the ref already eh ?
Well good thing we dont have any players missing
"We haven't really been opponents on your level this year... (I know it's a final and anything can happen though, even if I'd consider Barça favorites)"
"*puts out a bowl of salsa* 

Anyone bring guacamole?"
Even Netanyahu wants you to lose today… that is why it won’t happen
I don’t agree to that
I understand your statement but here take my downvote
Downvoting a person literally supporting a team huh. Not even attempting to hide the bullshit anymore.
But they could still chant something back without jumping.
So does Barca fans
"Yes, but all they have to do is win twice with a mere 1-0 in order to fuck Barça's season and getting close to also winning the league.

All in all Barça will still have a 9-4 advantage over the entire season, but will be trophyless.

The entire 9 goals don't count at this point. They have plenty of quality up front to score against Tek and Barça players are visibly tired."
And then u woke up
Even tourists use the same metro to go to the bernebau.
Are you la copa del rey?
I do know that yes who’s denying it?
14 years ago that was…
"Agreed it is our only chance and should be taken seriously, but generally the club doesn’t care about la copa, which I disagree with."
In 33 years we’ve won it 7 times. What does that say to you?
"No but really, Barcelona is going to walk us again since it's 9-2 and they seem to be going to win absolutely everything this season!

What are the stats? First in Liga, best in Champions and favoured against Real.

Surely they win the treble!

REVIVO LA MUFA.

MUFA MUFA BARCA."
"Yeah, as much as I hate to admit it, form just does not matter in a Clasico."
"Those bookies don’t know math, it’s a final, the chance than any of the two teams wins in 100% not just 80%"
"Yeah, the team that Arsenal walked over. Even Madrid fans know how shit their team is."
Rolo Tomasi
Another lil boy who didn’t read the documents😂
"Nah ,, not afraid of that to be honest 

Barça can score 5 0 with or without ref’s help haha."
Lil bro tryna pose as a Bayern fan😂
Wrong flair buddy
Coping at it's highest order
"Anulo mufa ha sido corrido hasta la mierda 

Culés get angry when they're told that they're playing the league on easy mode and going ""AnUlO muFA"" like they're leicester 2016. 

If you were betting on a team to score five today in the Clásico who would you bet on? 

Be honest."
"It has picked up lately, but damn I remember that champion’s league one, and the fight at the end of the game."
Especially the last two clasicos
"I know it is in Spain, and it’s still huge where I’m from as well, but I feel the younger generations don’t care as much."
Bro enjoy cricket forget supporting Barcelona
go back to cricket and take that flair off
average ******* ***
"Understandable, its shit. But here is the picture since people are asking.
https://imgur.com/a/o16u1Iw"
that are embarrassed by the behavior of your club?
im surprised people know this little club
I don’t see how that’s remotely as bad as telling someone to die?
"of course, but it is kind of the style of the club. Like Miami with Messi it attracted a lot of messi fans but miami plastics. Same can be said for Madrid because they go the more galcticos style which is no doubt good for the financials but can make the fans seem less passionate as shown. I am not talking about hardcore Madridistas btw obviously."
you think plastics are problematic? they are generally the least problematic of any fanbase.
Can't believe Madrid pulled it off
This is much bigger than Arsenal Blackpool tbf
"For me it was a few disassociative experiences with hallucinogens, had some weird ego death thing. Getting older helps as well"
"Given the added context of what RMTV and Perez has been doing in the buildup to the final, it's a fair statement."
That’s the Madrid way 😜
"At the end of the day, you guys are still Madrid. Never underestimate Madrid."
"Clasicos are always a special kind of game, in my opinion they never have a clearcut favorite."
"The people downvoting you probably just support Barca, not a big deal lmao"
Fist time on this subreddit I see
Sure about that? I can recall multiple instances to the contrary
From the nightmare?
"Bernabéu *. This is the AVE, a fast train from Madrid to Sevilla, not a metro... Foreigners would fly to Sevilla directly, people from Madrid either drive (5hrs approx) or get the train (2.5hrs)"
Pretending a competition is beneath you and playing it down is a serious form of coping.
Your point being? You guys said that shit at that point too.
"That Real Madrid got knocked the fuck out 26 times, just like today. I hope that clears up any confusion"
"This is why we need tone indicators, I genuinely can't tell if you're joking or not"
No that’s another lil kid who believes every bit of media RM chucks at them and thinks they are part of the investigation committee + believes they won 15 UCL by playing top level football
Explain the documents 
So you did or was it Sport that did it for you?
"Not against Inter tho, you have been very solid"
"Real Madrid is not the kind of club you just assume to be beaten before a match. Yes, Barcelona has (and is) beaten them this season. heavily. But Real Madrid not for nothing has a reputation for turning matches around.


Yes, Barcelona are the favourites to win, but as I said, never assume real Madrid is beaten
 "
"Yeah true, mou vs pep was peak entertainment"
Well yeah barcelona were rolling over for the previous 2 years lol
I've never even watched a highlight reel of cricket in my life. What are you on about.
What am I supposed to be seeing ?
That's supposed to be Messi? It's a big stretch.
Honestly? Can't see shit. Just a white phone case.
damn that's crazy bro
"I'm not embarrassed. But I do hate what they have been doing this season, like that entitled child. Yea, so many UCL titles, but show some respect. I have been supporting them for the past 20 years. I used to get riled up. Now I'm at peace. I do support clubs who play good football but I'll always be a Madrid fan."
I was at their school academy (I sucked) and also made them 3-yime sextuple champions in FM (I ruled).
El club més gran de la ciutat
Personally I only know of CE Europa because I stumbled upon it while performing research for a football short story I was working on
It is racially motivated
You need a new pair of eyes then
"You are talking about literally every big team in the world. How many fans do you think Barca gained during the Messi era? They had a team that is widely regarded as the best there has ever been, “playing like prime Barca” and you don’t think they have plastics?"
Holy shit what was that brahim diaz performance
Not if you support Arsenal or Blackpool.
This sub is literally r/ Barca at this point lmao
Lmao exactly they put so much pressure on the ref the guy was crying in the press conference
Makes sense. Does the club book the entire train beforehand? Are only the fans allowed to use it on that day during those hours?
Your opinion.
Did we? Where?
Yes so the clubs gives no fucks about CDR. Hope you understand the context.
Turns out that was all lies
Contra anulo la anulación
"lmao 1-0 down

no nos has visto esta temporada, verdad? Arsenal tampoco lo viste.

esa reputacion se murio en agosto."
Yeah like how we still managed to smash Madrid 4-0 in Bernabeu when we were in a rebuilding phase
"Nothing I can say or post will convince you otherwise, so go to the post yourself, I told you how to find it. You can go to the source yourself, enlarge the picture, its high resolution.

I stopped going cause we moved to raval (i also sucked)
Aah thanks for the explanation… well that’s not great either football “fans” man smh
Someone explained that it’s racially motivated which I didn’t know so I understand that that’s also not fine… but the issue here is that instead of recognizing that telling people to die is bad you just comeback with a “but they said this”… none of them are fine
I've not mentioned Barce not having plastics?
Bro acts like he's part of the team. Who are you to say the CDR is below RM
"Everywhere, including here. 

And we saw how you guys celebrated the 1-2, tonight."
This is literally false.
"What, no it wasn't? Barca literally paid money to the VP of refs for 2 decades, who was in charge of promoting/demoting refs, for reports that don't exist. The Spanish Civil Guard already concluded that.

That is 100% true.

The case is still ongoing, and the latest news was that money lancering was ruled out. The question remains what they then paid for.

But they did pay...

Edit: these are just facts. https://www.elmundo.es/deportes/futbol/2024/08/05/66b0c952e9cf4afe2f8b4576.html"
"Si. Si he visto esta temporada, y si estás viendo el partido ahora mismo, verás que el real Madrid está siendo peligroso."
Well yeah but we won 6 in a row before that lol
"Mate I'm just responding to what you linked.

[This ](https://imgur.com/a/Ys4zweN) is literally what I see. A white phone case with a black spot.

I don't care about looking it up because I have no dog in this fight. Just trying to let you know that not everyone has ""deeper intentions"". I'm just a dude in a forum telling you that the picture you linked doesn't look like what you said."
"1. That most likely isn't Messi.

2. Didnt Real Madrid give presents to referees?

Can't wait to hear ur excuses now."
"Teenage fights are understandable. We were also in that place. But after a point, one has to accept that it's just a sport and no need to be toxic in social media. If the team is not doing well and making a meme out of everything, then just accept it and move forward instead of always supporting every bad thing done by the team/players."
"Never said either one is fine.
Just telling you what came before those death chants."
So whats your point champ?
I can tell you’ve never lived in Spain or never read Spanish media and that’s fine. If you don’t know that fact then do some research.
"If according to you, that it's literally false, and therefore there's prove in the documents, knowing the documents are handy, why is Barca not condemned by a judge for it?

Do you get it yet or do I have to explain it to you like you are five."
"lmao which case? have they been investigated by la liga? rfef? heck even csd? or have somehow, after 5 years with all this insane proof, there has not even been a single charge.

maybe this 'proof' that released maybe amounted to nothing because this proof is nothing but smear allegations.

EDIT: to anyone who thinks that el mundo report is legit, they are a sporting gossip newspaper in spain equivalent to the daily mail or even the sun

EDIT 2: the spanish civil guard are a body that have 0 authority in football to anyone who gets fooled by the long name, they're not the police nor a governing spanish football org"
"peligroso? peligroso hubiera sido que hubieramos metido esas ocasiones. uno no gana con ""ocasiones"" o ""momentos de peligro"""
"Well getting smashed 4-0 is not really rolling over now, is it?"
Gil Manzano.
"I answered a question?  
""why aren't madrid fans jumping"""
Lol that's even more embarrassing. A sports team that thinks a competition which has been around since the inception of football in Spain is not worth competing for> Also I never knew the media represents the view of the players? You make yourself seem like you have some sort of insight but to say Real Madrid the institution or players do not care about beating their biggest rival while simultaneously winning a trophy seems pretentious and stupid ash
Seems like your Canadian anyways. No Spanish person would go out their way to support the Whitecaps lmao
"Then if Madrid gets or has gotten favours, why isn't there a case filed against them in court? Why is it only the barking haters moaning about it and not an official case against Madrid?

Edit: Wait, no! I forgot what subreddit I'm commenting on lmao. Braced for the downvotes (the default coping mechanism) from you lot."
"Bro you’re talking to a bunch of delusional Madrid fans who believe their campaigns blindly.

Don’t get on their level, they are trying their best to blame the body that literally helped achieve everything they could possibly achieve throughout their existence because this season they been visited by the Catalonian Freddy Krueger 🤣"
"Damn the Barca propaganda really has done a number on you...

Barca paid 7.5 million for ghost reports. That's just a fact.

https://www.elmundo.es/deportes/futbol/2024/08/05/66b0c952e9cf4afe2f8b4576.html"
1-1  qué quería ir le dijera que su club es una mierda o qué?
"They had the league won that year lol fuck them it’s a new era, they’re rolling over with galacticos now 😜"
The plastics are not really the ones seen in this video. It’s hard to call match going fans in Spain plastics
"Again, you clearly show your lack of knowledge of Spanish media to not know that players speak to the media all the time. Also, youre a Barcelona fan so why do you care? You seem to have anger issues as you come on Reddit to belittle people’s views based on your opinion and not actual facts. As a real Madrid supporter (and native Spanish speaker that’s lived in Spain before and read Spanish media all day) I think I have more of an insight into what’s going on at the club than you. If you, as Barca fan, told me that Laporta gives no fucks about CDR, I’d believe you as probably know more about your team than I do…"
"Jesus, you’re so ignorant you think that no Spanish person lives in Vancouver and supports the Caps. Time to start travelling my friend."
"strange how when tebas comes out himself and says there is no evidence for barca paying the referees which is evidence enough that the whole 'negreira' is nothing but projection from madrid... and you guys STILL believe this nonsense

but when the referees of copa del rey and referee body of spain comes out to say they will take 'unprecedented historic action' next season against this behaviour (literally a day ago) you conveniently ignore that legal part too"
"So you deny the conclusion from the Civil Guard.

Imagine if Perez had paid 7.5 million to the VP of refs. You'd not talk about anything else."
"who is the spanish civil guard and why is this esteemed report published in... a sporting gossip magazine? the spanish civil guard is a body that has 0 authority lmao, they aint the police and they aint a body that has any say in spanish football

tebas coming out himself and saying there is no evidence is evidence enough that the whole 'negreira' is nothing but projection from madrid"
honestamente sí pero igual no creo que ganamos
I am American. I am aware of how diverse nations are but the issue is you imply that you have an insight from currently living in Spain

Did they remember they're Second Half FC?
Terrible defending. He had a free header six yards out
"Barca stopped playing, what is that defending."
Barca have completely lost control of the game. Let themselves get into a shootout with a team that has Mbappe and Vini
Arda Guler showing Carlo again why he should start.
Guler is sick .  the first corner delivery was also super good but Barcelona survived and on the second one he re-creates the great delivery again
barca have shit the bed
Guler genuinely is one of the best corner takers in the world. One of the best aspects of his game ngl
Barcelona hasn't returned to the 2nd half
Real Madrid struggled with corners in the first half... now it's Barcelona.
"I think this second part is the best I've seen Madrid on the ENTIRE season wtf.

Did Ancelotti need to be fired to cook???"
They can't keep getting away with this. But they do.
fuck off that's what happens when we don't score our chances
"ASSIST FROM ARDA

Turkish social media is going to go nuts"
Arda have my kids
Real knew that dont need corners (first half) until arda is on the field
r/soccer 9/11
arda = türkish özil
Fucking madrid lol
"lol

lmao even"
r/soccer in shambles
Terrorists win
MATCH THREAD ABOUT TO BE FILLED WITH SO MUCH TOXICITY!!
lmaoooooooo
Should have been sent off in the first half
"so deserved, they were dominating the whole half"
Isn't vini doing the same gesture lewandowski was suspended 3 games for?
Didn’t have any doubts(nearly had a heart attack during the first half)
Shouldn’t even be on the pitch.
Just handed over the game. Complete collapse
Fucj this shit
Can’t belive Mbappe has turbo charged this comeback when he should have had a 5 game ban
I DON'T BELIEVE T
We are so back
ah yes because obviously the player that should've been sent off scores
Deserved. Real have been superior in the second half
This is what happens when a fucking ref keeps u in the game
should be off
"Ofc, the guy that shouldve been off for a scissor tackle in the first half. But Barca really need to be better than this."
Have that ye cunts.
He shouldn’t even be on the pitch with the 15 yellow card fouls too hilarious
REAL MADRID IN FIRE !
Should have been off the field about 30 minutes in but sure. Fuck off
totally other team in the 2nd half
Is this just fantasy?
Lets go !!!
Wow they've done it again
2nd half FC is back
Kounde was marking him and just left wtf
LOL!!!! Saw it coming a mile away.  The shift in morale is evident.
R/soccer 9/11
LFG the two guys I've been goint to bat for link up
Ardas corners are something else
Might not have to kms tonight
I DON'T BELIEVE T
Saved by the French
What a game
"I feel like Madrid have a flowchart for their season

CDR is only an option if they're out of the CL"
I’m not surprised 
Ofc the player that should've been carded scores
HOLY FUCKING REMONTADA
Goodbye gift or Carlo
Gulersexuals I owe you an apology I was not familiar with your game
r/soccer is shambles hahahahaha
"This Barcelona vs Real Madrid's fans in Sevilla clip is gonna end up legendary, no matter what"
Arda is fucking amazing on dead balls
~~Copa del Rey~~ Champions League
"Deserved, Barca is  totally clueless what to do against so many midfielders and fowards. Yamal and Raph  selling job today"
Güler means business
Terrorists win
"As a neutral, I'm loving how this is playing out lmao"
Loot at that Inigo shirt pull lmao
Remon - fucking - tada bitchass
"Anyone see the guy from The Platform celebrating that goal topless?

""Hablar ya no me agota"""
Guler and Mbappe subs have changed the game completely in the second half
This corrupted club player should be sent off in first half. Gratz you bought ref and win.
"That shirt grab was wild on the other player, they pull shirts like crazy in Spain"
"Arda needs to have many more minutes, absolutely changed the team"
"Arda and Modric really change the game, since they got in real madrid started playing really well"
Madrid vs the world. The hate is insane 👑
I'm watching the tennis on tv in madrid and heard a load of honking in the background. Then checked here.
Fucking robbery
"Barca needs batter bench. They are tired as fuck, with all these youngsters end of season going to be difficult"
There was even a big ass shirt pull on someone there
"Lmao the commentator is a prophet 
""What a good ball did Arda Guler place. And he will do it again from the corner. He gets prepared. He places the ball there with a great curvoaaaaal"""
Guler is HIM
That was all Guler
Inter fans praying for E.T.and penalties
Modric changed everything by pressing and that tackle and it’s gone well for Madrid since then. Barca haven’t came out yet
"I wont critizise Vini anymore

Such a crybaby but what a second time he is having"
El que no los hace los ve hacer
"played like shit all game, we deserve to lose. 

We dont have what it takes clearly ..."
Wtf happened to Barca in the second half
"Icl, even as a Barca fan, I wonder how RM would have done if they trusted Arda more. He’s their best passer alongside Modric. Losing Kroos hurt them badly and although Arda plays further up than Kroos, they have no one besides Modric with great passing."
Barca is burnt. This 2nd half is bad. Maybe there's a miracle that'll happen but they look tired.
Dark arts of teta have rubbed off on RM
George Bush meme.jpg
Iñigo Martinez pulling Rudiger shirt as well. Wonder if VAR would’ve came in if it didn’t end up in goal.
Arda Güler with rhe precision cross. He's the one tou need to deliver perfect action under stress
Classic tale of the goal who should be off scores
I love jude bellingham
Barcelona is useless ffs.
"Fuck r/soccer 

VAMOS AURELIO QUE GOLAZO"
*dies inside*
Predictable
Barca are fcking shitting themselves wtf
Barca haven’t played at all in the second half. Comeback was inevitable
Are the refs still corrupt or is it all ok now that Madrid is getting what they want?
From a set piece you say?
Meltdown on r/soccer beautiful (not Madrid fan just hate Barca)
"Deserved

It’s been coming and Flick did nothing to adjust. For such experienced manager, Flick is one amateur ass coach."
"LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOO

EAT SHIT r/soccer"
LMAO the trebles are crumbling this week
Ah so this is the remontada I kept hearing people talk about
"Come on Barça, SAVE FOOTBALL"
"After all the smugness from Barcelona fans, this is so delicious."
Much the better side in the second half! let’s go!!!
"Rigged game anyways. The guy who should have been sent off scored and rudiger is still without yellow card and no pen on cubarsi. Should have just gifted them the trophy when they were crying yesterday. And don’t forget that mbappe shouldn’t even be in this match, his suspension got lowered to 1 match. Absolute robbery on the pitch and off the pitch."
eat shit reddit
"So all those Barca fans concede that Rudiger was fouled, right?? If that was a ""clear pk"" on Cubarsi, then this surely was a foul too? 

Luckily, Real scored anyways. But I would have loved to see the mental gymnastics Barca would have gone through lol"
"Let's get at least one major Trophy.

And hopefully, this fucks up Barca's focus in the league as well"
Playing without a GK will do this to you
I wonder what the narrative will be today if Barca end up bottling this
"Reminder that Real Madrid as an institution threatened the match’s referee and then the same referee failed to call a blatant penalty against them in the first half. Crazy coincidence, though, right?"
Tchouameni saving us from all the noise.
"Barca gonna choke choke choke


Hahahahahahaha"
LETS GOOOOOO
Barcelona seem to have forgotten how to play football in the 2nd half
Flick literally let them walk over them. They’ve been relentless this half and he did nothing to adjust. Poor game management
"No, Carlo remembered that Vazquez and Rodrygo contribute nothing to the team. No clue why he makes us play 9v11 for like 50 minutes every fucking match."
Set Piece FC
This sub if Real wins 😅
Aged like wine / milk
"This team still aint better than Barca fuck this game

Check the league standings"
Barca didn’t come out for the 2nd half.
Cannot believe how they have dipped in defending when the second half came on. Crazy
Kounde loses him and the goalkeeper should probably come for the cross
Yeah Barca just completely shit the bed in the 2nd half like wtf man
benched till the end of the season for proving Carlo wrong
He's pretty weak in duels
They've been on the ropes for a while
Real Madrid has been creating all the chances in the second half.
"Pressing like mad mans for 45 mins with not a lot of decent players on the bench is gonna do that to you

Pedris been actually dead for the second half, gerard martin too"
"Mbappé, Güler, Modric changed the match"
Is this remontada? 🦋
Subs changed the game for Madrid
"Hansi Flick is an incredible attacking coach, but there’s a real lack of pragmatism in moments like these. He’s made zero adjustments despite the game clearly going the other way for a while now."
* caga la cama
"Not really. It is just that Madrid has been applying crazy pressure since the start of the 2nd half. It's not like Barça fell asleep or anything, they just got asphixiated."
"Barca with the ref ant even beat REAL BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

edit: DOWNVOTE IT BABY!!!!!!!!!! WE GONNA WIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

edit2: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUCKINNNN COURTOISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
😭😭😭😭😭"
Mikel arteta licking his lips
"He finally put Modric and Guler at the pitch on the same time, It’s insane what few good passers do to a team"
You typically need fire to cook yea
Who knew that making subs before the 85th minute would help?
Yeah Madrid has honestly been pure fire this half. Bellingham has been WV everywhere intercepting and progressing the ball.
"Yeah crazy level. Very inspired runs by Bellingham, Mbappé and Vinicius thanks to a suddenly very dominant midfield."
Best we've looked since we kicked out City
Once again the disrespect for your multi CL-winning manager is just mind boggling to any fan of a sane football club
He must have heard Flo on the phone with Xabi during the half. Early subs and playing Arda?!
https://i.imgur.com/l3r7RmJ.png
I love those 🥳 honesty Real deserve the hate fuck them
/r/soccer and /r/soccercirclejerk in shambles 😂
Ankara özil
Madrid have the Turkish Ozil and the Brazilian pele
well we definitely can't in UCL this season
"When you have refs your side, it's easy"
Probably the first team we are doing it this season
I CANT BELIEVE WE AREE HOLY FUCKKKK
varcelona yeah
From Madrid fans
Guess death threats to referees work in the end
Barca really lost because of a player who should have been sent off and a player who shouldn't have been able to play in the first place
Never seen a situation a Barca fan couldn’t whine about
Tears are gonna be epic tonight lmaoo
"Deserved after first half robbery?
2 pens, 4 red cards"
Anyone who’s watched Madrid get away with the same shit for the last 10 years can believe it though
Neither do I!
Good for Salah his bdo chances tho
r/soccer coping hard
"Nono no 15 maybe like 60 billion fouls, shut the fuck up, cope"
Already crying😂😂😂
It's remodanta
 Barca have been second half FC all season
Made up for it in fairness
Agreed Kounde was immense
Still feel like that?
"Well that's the long game they've been playing. Two pens not given in the first half, endless yellow cards not shown and there you go."
Winning and still finding a way to whine and complain how everyone hates you lmfaoo
I'm sure you're the one who ended up melting down in the end
"Shut your ugly ass mouth. He is playing with kids whole season. they are all tired since they are playing every 3 days, no Lewa no Balde"
"Nah, you first, Madrid definitely did"
Served by Touchi
Hahaha lmao
"Brother, don't act like RM winning the Copa is the end all be all of things."
Aged well innit
The Liverpool of Spain
I agree! Visas Barca!!!!!
Literally got away from a red card and a pen and you idiots still thinking the world is against you lmfao
Against you? The ref has been giving you everything
Winning and still finding a way to whine and complain how everyone hates you lmfaoo
CHEATERS WE ARE!!
Hahahaha come again?
Would you like some?
Wait you guys hate rodrygo now?
"Especially after that hate boner they got. 

It’s a game lads, our club being too sensitive to mistakes, is the same as your reaction to them."
Bro I’m a Barca fan but this game Barca is playing so poorly and their recent form has also been lacking
Check this game lmao
Barca must’ve forgot that since the second half started
Barcelona have been dogshit in this second half. Embarrassing from front to back
Busy bleaching their heads
Yeah. They thought they had won it already
On the other hand he's pretty good at football
And Rodrygo is super strong?
He has other strenghts but he isn't that bad at them
Carlo must have raised BOTH eyebrows during the halftime talk
Bellingham also remembered that he’s a good player
Yes but for us
You don't say...
fucking idiot
The ref saving madrid you mean?
I love that both sets of fans say the other team has the ref in their pockets
Mbappe and Vini realized they are playing a final too
r/angryupvote
"Nobody is disrespecting him, it's just the fact that he is stuck with his fab 11 and is rigid on making any subs."
Not really when you consider how bad the club played man
spoke too soon 😔
"You guys got slammed by Prime Arsenal, they can win the UCL."
Glass houses?
Here comes the crying..
womp womp :)
we're lifting the trophy while y'all are still crying to the refs 😘
Make another video about the ref
You must be joking lmfaooo
"indeed they are delicious, thank you madrid fans 😊"
The video and ref threat worked
get in mate
Clear scissor tackle from behind in the first half
We actually watch games unlike you
Least biased most intelligent Madrid fan btw.
Hypocrisy is crazy from this brain dead fan base
"I still can't believe it, don't jinx it please"
"Retrospectively, i was being too dramatic, It was a tight match overall.

But we've been very mediocre this month, across the board.

I'm not very optimistic about the rest of our fixtures, hopefully I'm still too dramatic ..."
Like we give a fuck lmao this is just the average day here
The other comment is definitely whining but this one - just saying fuck r/soccer is not whining bruh
It’s just football bro
Imagine being proud of child labour in 2025
TOLD YOU WE COLD SAVE IT
"After all the shithouse they brought for the Copa final, they definitely deserve losing it"
"You win some, you lose some."
"Barcelona will go farther this UCL than them, but on the other hand the Reds will most likely not bottle the title."
Phew indeed
"No theres no hate, i even think my take is pretty unpopular among madridistas, but this guy will perform for like 1 month or 2, then ghost for ages. Like right now he doesn't have a goal or an assist in 14 league games, as a starting attacker for Real Madrid."
someone gotta be the scapegoat somehow
No it fucking isn't lol
"I'm a Madrid fan, I been hate watching all season, I don't recognize this Barca team."
Yeah cry harder
With a trophy ;)
Are you dumb enough to really think that or you just had to write something?
Yeah he's surprisingly strong in duels. Definitely makes up what he lacks in determination 
"Raising his first eyebrow is like Kenpachi removing his eyepatch 

Raising both eyebrows at the same time... is like Kenpachi gripping his sword with both hands."
rivalry at its finest
and they are right
He Should be save with Stones out injured
HAHHHAH here comes the crying
"Shameless, truly"
"Ref saved y’all, clear DOGSO yet yellow"
Is this game over u clown?
You don't expect much from a fan base who can worship beings like Rudiger
We have the momentum. RM will win
Yes because someone who dosent care definitely would mention the subreddit during celebrating winning the game 
fucking reddit how soft are you
"I'm just having fun man, cheers!"
"> he doesn't have a goal or an assist in 14 league games

the horror"
"He's not a scapegoat, are you telling me its not a valid criticism that one of our 3 attackers has zero goal involvements for nearly half of the league matches?

On top of the fact that we play a 4-3-3 instead of a 4-3-1-2 to accomodate him, when he doesnt really deserve that."
They’ve picked it back up a bit thanks to el tiburon 🦈 but yeah in general very weary play from them the past few weeks and today
Lmao came to bite me. Fair fucks. Gratz
Negreilona FC. Enjoy the cheating win
no it wasn’t there were 3 barca players surrounding him and wasn’t even ahead of the last defender 
😂😂 50 mins after Tchou shouldve had a red keep coping
Already crying?
Its sounds like you're joking? Having zero goal contributions in 1/3 of the leagues games isn't good at all when you're an attacker for a top level club like Madrid.
"It's a rather unknown club with a pretty cool history, you can read a bit about it [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_Europa)."
My grandpa played for the club
"Shame UESA couldnt win against Valencia, to keep it spicy on the last matchday. But they simply struggle too much against these B teams."
"I was near the stadium when they beat Alzira 4-0 and got smashed with some fans lol, força Europa! By far the best club in Barcelona city."
Isn’t that the place that’s covered in mice?
"I like their logo, looks like Homer Simpson's butt

Thx, will check out their history"

"Loopholes? Nah.

Another heartwarming story of a billionaire 'convincing' the APL and FA to change the rules in order to sign their future biggest rivals best player."
can you elaborate for those not familiar with the A-League?
"Damn I remember him from his Hannover days, he was so good there too"
"The only other NZ team (Wellington) lost their most promising GK to Bournemouth, who just happened to loan him back to Auckland (owned by the same chap) immediately.

It’s called the “Caceres rule” as Manchester City started buying good A-League talent then loaning them back to Melbourne City - and it started with Anthony Caceres. The league banned it after this."
"Of course.

Auckland are owned by the same owners as Bournemouth. In the summer Bournemouth bought the Wellington Phoenix goalkeeper Alex Paulson. who had been the best in the league.

They loaned him straight to Auckland, which should be against A League rules. The Cacares Clause was introduced after City bought a player from Central Coast and immediately loaned him to Melbourne City, another City Group club.

The FA just dropped the rules to allow Auckland to do it.

There is all sorts of other stuff with navigating the salary cap that aloiws them to spend twice that of Phoenix."

"If the referee did a proper job in the first half Barcelona runs away with this game.

I'm not trying to blame him for anything because he went through alot but holy fuck the pressure they put on him worked. He was scared to make the big calls."
Should be thanking the ref. Kept you in it and a number of Madrid players on the pitch when they should have seen red.
Smart from him not to comment on his own player.
Top 10 respect moments in football
"Madrid succeeded in doing what they wanted. The ref was scared to call against them, two legit pens weren't even looked at. Generational crash out from rudiger tho"
did he bring up the ref unprompted or was he asked about him? that would make a pretty big difference imo
"They still have no shame commenting on the referee, unreal man hahah"
"Ancelotti: “In the second half, we were closer to winning than Barça. We did everything we could. I can't criticize the team. We have two days to rest, and then we will prepare for two important games against Celta and Barcelona."""
No comment on the ref cause he helped us a lot but we still found a way to lose it.
Cry your hearts out
Generational crashout
"“I won’t comment on the ref…. Cause they 100% fell for the pressure we put on them and beneficiare us throughout the game” right Carlo ? 

Right??"
How I would kill to be reffed like Madrid are
No comment on the ref tonight as if they NEED to comment everytime😂
"Aint no way bro is doing the ""no comment"" gimmick again. You got away with at least two clear penalties and a red. The game should have been dead by regular time. De Burgos clawed you back from the grave and you're still complaining."
Ancelotti QUEDATE!!!!
The ref actually kept them in the game.
The most shameless club ever if they complain about the refs when the ref ate 2 pens(cubarsi one debatable but the one on ferran was clearer than the one we got vs celta) and a clear red from tchouameni
Real Madrid is soft as fuck. The entire club are cowards at heart and straight up bitches. Mbappe should have had his jaw broken for that foul a few games back. Instead that frog looking bitch got to play today. Nothing but entitled fucking cowards.
">No comment on the ref tonight.”

Hilarious, Tchouameni was lucky to escape a red card and Rudiger was lucky the ref didn't call a pen on him for fouling Ferran in the box"
"Genuinely wild that Real Madrid are trying to push a victim narrative with the ref. They got away with 2 obvious penalties, and the 1 time the ref *did* give Barcelona a penalty, VAR finally decided to take their job seriously and correctly overturned the call. Right or wrong, pretty much every major call went their way. One questionable foul call in midfield at the end of the match and they lose their minds like it's the greatest injustice in football history."
"Yeah yeah I feel for you man I too am hurt but it's time to go, Brazil is nice this time of the year I'm sure




Pls take the other guy with you"
He should stay in Madrid for at least 1 more season.
He’s def leaving
No comment?😭🙏 Ref robbed 2 pens from Barca.
The ref was on your fucking side mate
Ppl really think Carlo is classy coach? After b’Dor fiasco and him going after referees in the recent weeks
Will he have a comment on the ref tomorrow?
Today I feel madridista 
Go tonight. You taking to fucking long. Last 15 games Madrid didnt win any gime with +2 goals difference. Its a shame to watch it hurts to watch.
"Commenting on the ref is RMTVs job, unless carlo is the one making the videos for them"
"Nooo carlo pls stay 

We will miss u 😢"
"There‘s nothing to comment on regarding the ref, he was fine"
"Madrid players were visibly hurt by this game.. Bellingham didn´t know what to do with himself he was visibly so gutted, I hope they pick themselves up again they just need to addresse few issues like bringing in two midifield technicians, 2 fullbacks and a goal poacher like Balkan Haaland Vedat Muriqi who can come off the bench and decide games"
No comment on their best player?
"Bro, the ref was super solid. Very few mistakes, none major ones. Just start being good at your job again please."
Honestly I respect this man a lot as a rival fan he had LV playing like fucking prime cafu the previous season in the Elclassico
"Fuck, I was hoping he would announce he was leaving today. Goddamnit"
"Yep. Thankfully, no one got injured. Also loved how the ref went ""fuck this"" at the end with Antonio Psychopath Rudiger."
"Indeed, it was baffling that Tchouameni wasn't sent off for tackling Olmo. Also the pen on Ferran was quite clear, imo"
Ancelotti has managed to destroy every bit of his gentlemen image in the past 12 months. He’s coming off like a crybaby nowadays.
"Yep, pretty much. Congrats, Madrid. You bullied the ref into submission. And you still lost. Hard to sympathize when they all act like entitled bratty children when nothing goes their way."
Professional victims lmao
"""today the ref was bad for barca but he helped us and was good for us""  
yeah all he could do was to say no comments lol"
"this bs is exactly how the mourinho era animosity started. 
Madrid got ass blasted the first classico, next one they started playing defensively but extremely hard and nothing would get called against madrid.
So Barca started over reacting, theatrical falls on fouls, mobbing the ref etc and it devolved into what we all saw.

I hope this doesn't go that way, but thus madrid side seems really entitled and bratty"
How Lucas Vazquez did not get a yellow card with all those fouls is beyond me
Low-key Carlo is only a class act when he wins and is a sore loser . I am incredibly biased tho so I don’t mind if I’m downvoted to oblivion
Probably asked by the reporter
He was asked.
lol … can’t even make a “no comment” without people adding their own narrative 
Who even asked that question lmao. Do they have eyes or a bit of shame?
You are being unfair he was asked that
He literally said no comment are you thick? 
"These Barca morons are unreal. He literally said no comment. You can write, so you can clearly read as well. Is it a comprehension issue or are you just willingly blind towards what you don't like?"
"They asked him and he said he had no comment to make. The fuck should he reply, look at the journo in silence?"
"He said ""i will not talk about referee."" I think that's just him saying he doesn't want to get into this"
Someone whose manager was Xavi saying this without an ounce of irony is fucking wild. I agree we shouldn’t be doing it and it is beyond poor sportsmanship but christ man have some shame lol
"Don Carlo, with normal refereeing, Hansi would’ve started rotating his players the 2nd half , and Tchaouemeninga wouldn’t have been present to score."
eyy you are right but hey at least we got a dramatic game bro and tbh i cant even count how many times we did el remontada this season ... many memories to remember from this season  and hopefully we end up winning everything too .
The one where Rudiger dragged Ferran's leg scared me cause in my eyes it was a penalty. But what is the second clear one?
"He was fine for Madrid, for Barca he was absolutely atrocious"
"Actually he red carded 4 players after the match: Rudiger, Vini, Vasquez and Bellingham. Absolute chad, I wonder what they did (we did see Rudiger ofc)."
I mean there wasnt much room to act different with Rüdiger
"> Also the pen on Ferran was quite clear, imo

That was such a cheeky foul by Rudiger. Honestly really subtle but he knew exactly what he was doing gently sweeping Ferran's leg from behind and shielding himself from the refs vision. Can't at all blame the ref for missing it but VAR should definitely have called that, that's what they're there for.

Rudiger really is a master of the dark arts."
He knows he is gone. His attitude has changed massively this season.
"Given the build up to the match, Jude's comment during half time, Vini and Lordy Vasquez's protest after 120 min, Rudiger's bottle throw (or ice not fully sure yet).

Given all of this, Carlo's words interpretation isn't that the ref was neutral or helped real Madrid. At least to me, it sounds like he's still upset at the ref's performance and feels victimized by it."
"He said ""i will not talk about referee."" I think that's just him saying he doesn't want to get into this"
"Oh fuck this was a worst time to watch football in history, simulations, tackles, argues with refs, media bulshit, this was not a football, this was kind of Circus from both teams."
most top tier managers are.
the lewis hamilton school of PR
"Whilst I agree with you, doesn't this definition cover almost every professional football manager? I think the ambition and drive required to make it at the very elite level means you can never accept defeat, which leads to coming off as a sore loser. There aren't many managers or moments I can think of that show a very humble attitude to a loss."
But asking instead of assuming is the opposite of adding their own narrative? 
"So we just assume and move on? The guy just asked, I would have asked too. It’s better than assuming Carlo added the ref part on his own which changes the outlook on the whole comment."
They have neither.
I mean if you are a journalist I think that's a pretty good question for headlines
"Yeah I’m no Madrid fan, but not sure what Ancelotti is supposed to say here. He says ref did a great job, it stirs controversy. He says ref did a piss poor job, controversy. Apparently when he says no comment like he probably should after Madrid’s behaviour the few days, controversy. Side note, asking about the ref here is diabolical of the journo lmao"
"Sorry, Isaac's never getting added to Smash Bros."
Yeah my ass fat
Well after the controversy something like „ref was alright“ would‘ve been classy.
"Funny, because -nobody- asked this week, but that didn't stop the club from yapping."
"Ref favored madrid heavily, the least he could say is ""ref did a good job"""
"Que da igual amigo, deja a estos imbeciles chupandose la polla entre ellos"
There's always a well raised eyebrow
He could say he did a good job considering pretty much all of the calls favored his team. Literally the least he could do after everything his club put the poor guy through.

2020, COVID La Liga restart

Ancelotti last year claiming Madrid is above complaining about refs and they respect the authority in Spain and that they would not stoop so low as to complain or accuse them."
"if any of the 10 controversial decisions today went barcas way this game woulda been done in 45 minutes, PLEASE shut up"
Ceballos trying to get Cubarsi's shirt after Olmo's corner that hit the woodwork
"I think vini didn't get a red, per the ref report"
Probably because they reacted like bitches when Martinez went down after getting such a slap he didn't even need to dive like doing an assigement at Sergio Busquets's School of Theatrics.
"Source on this? They would all be suspended in the league then, right?"
Rudiger probably practices hoodoo and sacrifices chickens before every game because the shit he gets away with in every game is incredible.
kind of like mourinho's if i speak i'm in trouble kind of
"Not many of them get the ""classy"" rep Ancelotti constantly gets."
Lol that’s a bold statement
You should enjoy your win and stop looking for a drama fix.
"Well, he could have said the truth: ""thankfully he did a shit job, he kept us in the game"""
"How would complimenting the ref ""stir controversy""? That's basic sportsmanship. It's very common and normal for managers to give a perfunctory compliment to the ref after a match even if they don't mean it."
Too far man.. Let me live in delusion. It'll happen 😭
Based. I will be saying this when anyone says that to me
Anything he would've said he would've been hated on. So I think staying neutral is the best option
"So, lie? Dude made more mistakes than he has fingers and toes lmao"
"I wouldn't blame the guy for what his club's propaganda wing pumps out. It's complete stupidity to contradict your own team on basically anything, especially as the coach, so a no comment and dodging the question thing is the best you'd expect from basically any coach in his situation"
2 things can be true at the same time
">Ref favored madrid heavily

>the least he could say is ""ref did a good job""

So he should lie?"
But I am replying to your comment which was extremely hypocritical? Respond to that?
"Hmm... I saw both holding each other, so it would be hard for VAR to overturn it as an obvious error from the onfield decision."
"Yeah, looks like it. Which is strange as he did literally the same thing as Vasquez. I guess we will see what the officials decide for the suspensions."
It was Eric not Martin's but point stands
"Diving implies no contact. Embellished, sure, but him drawing attention to a hand in his face after the match the referee had doesn't surprise me."
Yes. The suspension carries into the league
Fabrizio Romano on Facebook
"I am celebrating, but to not give credit to Perez and RMTV for a job well done and a mission accomplished would not sit well with me.

A lame duck coach actually should feel some freedom to call RMTV for their antics. But its clear Ancelotti doesnt give a fuck about improving things at or for real seeing him let his goons run around trying to assault the refs while hes looking down at his shoes. Shameful really.
"At least it would be acknowledging they were favored, instead of implying the ref favored Barca by saying ""no comment"""
"did xavi complain when refs were blatanly calling in barcas favour? sure its bad regardless but the whistle today was legit the worst i have ever seen and your players and coach still think they are conspiring against them when the opposite is clearly happening, anyone with a pair of eyes that isnt brainwashed by this satanic institution can see that"
">instead of implying the ref favored Barca by saying ""no comment""

He didn't imply that, he basically said he doesn't want to answer the question he was asked about the ref."
"...so he should say ""yeah, the ref helped us many times, but we still lost""?"
"First off, I agreed that our whining is too much. Secondly, yes, he did. Thirdly, satanic? Go outside dude what the hell lol"
"Can you read? In madrid brain rot, they think this ref actually favored Barca this game, including you. Ancelotti is shameless by implying that by saying ""no comment""."
"for sure. yes satanic, they practice black magic and stab voodoo dolls"
"Ancelotti, trying to diffuse all speculation and people creating a narrative, says no comment and y'all write a fucking script about what it really means lmao"

Couple years ago we'd be among the top in these lists but now we're on the opposite end of the spectrum.
Grandpas eating well in Spain
Grandpa Cholo
Chelsea never going to come in this list ever
Conte commits elder abuse.
Atletico have 15 players over 30? Surely that can’t be right.
Child Labour Fc
Didn't know you can play ppl over 30yo
Meanwhile we're sitting proudly at 0
"How does Transfermarkt think we've used eight players over 30 this season, when according to their data, we only have six players over 30 in our squad? I can tell you for a fact that one of those six didn't play a single minute as well."
Dad's army sides.
Only two of Everton's seven are contracted to next season (Pickford and Tarkowski). Gueye might stay but overall it'll be a much younger squad.
Would've thought more 30+ players are into Brest
Atletico keeps griezmann alive and wonder why they are not winning shit
"To be fair, there were seasons where Messi, Busquets, and Piqué would probably rack up +13.000 minutes just between the three of them. One of the things that a lot of people took for granted was Messi's ability to play a full 90, week in, week out. Of course, you can rightly point to his relatively low work rate off the ball, but on the other hand he was often tackled very roughly and had to endure a lot of physical play from opponents. His resistance to major injuries throughout his career is amazing and also speaks to his discipline as an athlete, because major injuries used to be a major concern for him until Pep sorted out his training regimen and diet."
All things considered Barca has done a very remarkable turnaround. For all his faults Laporta knows how to build good teams
"we are on 0 minutes lol, infact the oldest player to get any minutes at all is ben chilwell, 28 yo, 45 minutes."
We only sign 30+ year old center backs. Those are the rules
Messi took all the hard tackling in his career and remained mostly injury free. Then moved to MLS and became somewhat injury prone. Best deal of the century.
"Messi was very injury prone in his early years, constantly out of the team even once he was nearly whole season out, that changed when he was like 22 or something. He explained in interviews that it was because he changed his nutrition, before he was not eating healthy, a lot of fast food etc, he got a nutritionist and made a plan to avoid injuries and it worked well"
Laporta wasn't present when the mess was brewing .
That's kinda crazy lol

Lmao he called him clout chaser and a hater
"Harry, this one is on you. Interesting call to double down and blame the ref when you're in the wrong."
Nah that's 100% on him. He picked up the ball and prevented Mainz from taking the free kick. It's a nailed on yellow. He's only got himself to blame.
"you are winning 2-0 at this point, at home, against Mainz

just don't touch the fucking ball during opposing team free kick, how hard is that"
"Go to real madrid at this point dude, complain and whining is a sport there"
"Players should absolutely be fined for making accusations against the referees. It’s just ridiculous and completely unsportsmanlike to say something like that, especially after such a clear yellow card decision. I’m really frustrated by this ego-driven behavior that’s ruining the spirit of the sport these days!

It feels like they just don’t care anymore whether they are setting a good or bad example."
"Kane got some black voodoo curse

Guy just can't lift a trophy"
It would be sad to see Kane not playing in a potential title clincher.
"""It's kind of my story that I'll miss the game in Leipzig""- hearing him say that himself breaks my heart."
"Unlike Kane to say something like that and I don't agree with it, he was time wasting.

But I get why he said it. Finally going to win a trophy but won't be part of the game that wins it. Can't help but feel bad for him, but ultimately I don't think the suspension will be remembered - the title win will"
"Shouldn't have clutched the ball with your hands after being called for a foul then, Harry."
It’s always the referees fault never the player. I lost some respect for Mr. Kane
"I don‘t get the uproar. They will receive the trophy at the last home game anyways if the gap is big enough, so against Gladbach the week after. If anything, this yellow card made sure that he can‘t be banned for this match, so it‘s a positive"
"Weak stuff, Mr. Kane. That was a stonewall yellow."
Someone has a video of the foul?
Ref did him a favour by removing hiim from a title decider. Now Bayern can safely walk to the title without fear of Kane curse.
Classic whining and self-victimization.
Trust the Spurs in him to miss a title win 😂
"The poor guy can’t catch a break…

But the title is his"
"Good enough for the rat, enjoy watching the match numbnuts."
Referees are not having a great day.
"Beginning to realise why Harry basically gave generic media trained responses to all interviews during his time in the Premier League. 

It’s either this bizarre and risky take that brings the game into disrepute, swearing on your daughters life or whatever the hell that was in the Amazon documentary"
Fuck that's just sad. Let the man win a trophy on the pitch in peace. Bayern should fight the yellow
"“”You cannot have a heart in your chest, but a garbage bin” - Buffon” - Kane"
He thinks He plays for Madrid.
"yeah, very uncool to blame the ref here. low key an application for Real Madrid today"
"It is such a weird take from him, it gets cautioned very consistently. You see players who are intentionally looking for yellows do that kind of stuff. I get that Kane is frustrated, especially because it was (potentially) his first title winning game, but this is uncharacteristically whiney of him."
Thank goodness that they were too stupid not to properly go for him.
The refs also should be fined for making wrong calls then
If we win next weekend he will 100% sneak onto the pitch to lift it
The memes have got to him lmfao
He can always John Terry it
Professional yellow card
Delayed the restart by picking up the ball
"And it's happening in so many different leagues...

People are getting angrier and angrier and it leads to this."
Did you see the yellow card? He picked up the ball and delayed the Mainz free kick. It's a nailed on yellow and he has only himself to blame.
You do know he's still playing for Bayern?
"Lmao, true.

All he had to do was ~~to follow the damn train~~ NOT pick up the ball and he would've been fine..."
He thinks he plays for madrid.
Usual suspects lol
"One is a genuine mistake inherent to the job, the other is a deliberate and immature reaction because players can't control their emotions. In Kane's case he is also just flat out wrong, picking up the ball is pretty consistently a caution. I get that he is frustrated by missing his first title winning game, but he should direct that frustration at himself."
Flair checks out
Had a bad day?
You are allowed to be on the pitch after the game has ended. And you'll lift it in Hoffenheim in 3 weeks anyway not next week.
The memes wouldn't hurt him if they weren't true up until now.
Full kit wanker Kane is not a crossover I'd have thought I'd see.
Yeah? I'm just saying Bayern should appeal the yellow so Kane has a chance to win his first trophy while playing on the pitch
This does prove he really wasn't an Arsenal fan as a kid. If he was he'd claim it was a very specific conspiracy against him personally.
"Player emotions are part of the sport. If refs can't cope with it, that's not the player's problem"
You would expect a Bayern fan to know lol
"Won‘t they lift it against Gladbach if the margin is big enough? On the last home game, that‘s how it worked last years. So being banned next week actually made sure that he is there against Gladbach lol"
"tbf if there's any situation for a player to do it, it's this one"
They don’t do the title celebration in an away game if I recall
it's a perfectly fine yellow. ref is not to blame.
"It's one thing to be angry at a call, another to accuse the ref of being against you because of that call. Kane is a 30-year-old man, he should have the emotional maturity to not say something as stupid as this."
Ref emotions are part of the sport
"Maybe they became a fan last year.   
Always fun to root for the plucky underdog (with the 300m euro wage bill)."
Oh yeah probably. Thought there was a rule change some years ago because Bayern had to lift it in Wolfsburg but that was just because of covid.

Is the music necessary? Lmao
"Context: The players of Sloboda were furious following the decision, but the situation escalated into absolute chaos in the 87th minute. Referee Miloš Gigović awarded a penalty to the visiting team, Posušje, prompting Sloboda's players to refuse to continue the match. The final outcome of the game will be determined at a later date. It is worth noting that Gigović has recently officiated matches in the UEFA Champions League."
that's an outrageous call
That is a clear dive. Ref got duped
This result matters too because Posusje is fighting to stay out of relegation
"good ol' double dive

it's sad to see the depths to which cheating is normalized and accepted in the sport. And also the extent to which the officials incentivize it"
Didn't know Real started playing in the Bosnian league
"Even the diving guy wasn’t convinced. “Not my best acting”, he thought as he got up straight away."
"When you have a match rigging četnik as a president of your FA, it is bound to happen. Bosnian football needs to be investigated."
Fallon D'or material
"Bosnian soccer is incredibly corrupt; same for Serbia. Organized crime pays off players, refs to get results"
it’s not a pen but at full speed it’s not like the most egregious decision of all time
Looks like a pen
What was he's reason for the penalty call
Perhaps we should do the same in Serie A ngl
Make the music louder next time please
So that's where Slobodanmedada comes from…
No wonder there is no crowd watching this shit
This doesn’t look like a penalty to me but still can’t leave the match.
Real Madrid before var
Don't let Real Madrid take notes
"Gigovic is the biggest cancer in Bosnian football, him Njegomirovic, Kazlagic and Topalovic. The most corrupt refs. You already know when they are reffing the game some shady stuff is going to happen."
"You all are so hell bent on proving that all refs in the world are incompetent cheats that you wouldn't know an excellent call even if it slapped you in the face.

Even though you have a very good angle at around 0'45"", 0'46"", to explain the ref's call. There is an arguable elbow in the back of the blue forward about to jump for the ball, by red number 4. As slight as the elbow is (and do mind the fact that slow motion tends to distort your perception of what actually happened), as much as the blue attacker exaggerates, the elbow and the clear intent to elbow are here, and it's at the very least a debatable call, not in the least a scandalous one. We're so far away from the scandalous zone.

And to be fair, that's why this guy is the ref and you, well, fortunately aren't.

This is really one of the many ways football is in a sorry, sad state.  
People keep on defending VAR as a necessary thing because refs are supposedly too shit to make the right calls without VAR, as if we had any clue about whether referees are actually able to do their job or not without VAR (about what the rules of the games are and what refereeing is supposed to be really), but even when presented with said holy video images and their all knowing truths, they couldn't see a very clear foul even though it stares them in the face, and this thread shows."
That's literally the clearest pen ever. The only scandalous thing is that not being a red card.
Bunch of grown crybabies lmao.
[just needed this one sound effect for good measure.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa-ZIXJdDW4)
Ehhh probably not but it makes it more funnier 
"I mean, it does make it funnier haha"
Yeah I don’t think he will be doing too many more champions league games with those sorts of decisions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvufpe3NDUI
"It's not though. No matter what music you put on this clip, it's clearly a case of a referee getting a very acceptable call (in my opinion, an excellent one at that because that was not an easy catch) on a discreet but arguably existent foul.

Red number 4 clearly comes in from behind on the blue forward, with his elbow forward, to make that slight push that's enough to destabilize a forward about to jump or already jumping, but in a subtle enough way that might escape the referee. This time it didn't.

At no point in this action is he playing the ball, the ball isn't even here yet, and his elbow in the back of the forward is in no way a lawful way to play the game. Pay attention around 0'45"", 0'46"".

No matter how much the blue forward exaggerates, no matter how slight the push is (and it's not even with his hand, he puts his elbow to it), the push is here, it's clearly unlawful, the intent to foul the player is here, and it's at the very least a debatable decision, we're nowhere near outrageous, by miles.

And see, this is why this guy is referee, that's because he's able to spot that foul in the middle of the many things happening in this situation, and the rest of you aren't.

Unless for some reason you absolutely want it to be outrageous, as usual ; but I'm sure you're basing your comment on a thorough reading of the laws of the game and a solid knowledge of what a referee is supposed to do in such a situation, of course."
"Oh he didn't trust me, this happens weekly in the bosnian league and this probably isn't top 3 worst calls of this week... Also this ref is famous for his corruption"
"It wasn't even a dive, because then the player would stay on the floor and ask for it. He got up instantly, this is just blatant corruption."
"I work in the online gambling industry and sometimes I run into these reports about match-fixing. Sadly Bosnian Football been frequent popping up. 2018-19 season was really bad and it got uncovered (over 500 people involved), but its never really left. Its very hard to get rid of.    


(Not saying this is match fixing, but would not be the first time it happened)"
my money is on “corruption”
Raphinha literally just got a yellow for simulation I know you saw it since your comment is after the game so please lol
This isn't a very clear foul and the attacker is exaggerating the situation like hell. It's the softest of soft penalties and in 10 out of 10 normal games will not be rewarded.
"Focking hell! That's actually funny. 

I remember Klose at Bayern scoring goal against Fiorentina from being two meters offside in CL. That was infuriating. 

As this clip would be for the fans of the club being wronged."
"Blue backs into red who stands his ground. You know its a contact sport right?

"i ain't reading all that

i'm happy for u tho

or sorry that happened"
This being given as a penalty doesn't even come close to the calls Borac typically gets.
This ref is famous for corruption? And OP just posted additional info saying this guy recently reffed in the Champions League ….
"Well there's at least one of those 10 games where it was awarded, and it's right under our noses at the very top of this thread.

And to exaggerate a foul, you need for there to be a foul. Else it's a simulation. And if it's a foul, as small as it is, the referee made a correct call. Not necessarily THE correct call if it exists, but A correct call all the same.

But it's no matter, as I already said, most of you all are mostly hell bent on proving that every ref ever is an incompetent cheat and every refereeing decision ever is a complete scandal no matter if it actually is (and most of the time, by far, it isn't).

I'll let you guys examine the reasons why you spend so much of your life doing that even when your own team isn't even involved, and I'll keep this thread as a reminder of how honest and earnest all debates around referees and their calls are.

This is really a pristine case of a referee making a great, difficult call and beeing called out for it anyway, just because he's a ref and apparently we're supposed to do that all the time no matter what.

Gotcha all, duly noted."
"Blue is going for the ball, number 4 is going for the elbow in the back. You don't have to put your elbow forward to stand your ground, he could have just put his hands on his back without pushing (if only to signal to blue that he was standing behind him), which is what sensible defenders usually do before trying to make a lawful challenge and hinder the opposing attacker in a lawful way.

""This is a contact sport"" is nowhere in the laws of the game, you should try and check them. In fact, the word ""contact"" is actually mostly used in the laws of the game to... characterize fouls, not to tell a ref he should let ""contacts"" happen without doing anything about them.

And when it comes to this particular situation, elbowing an opponent in the back in your own penalty area is generally considered ill-advised according to the laws of the game, and I'm pretty sure most football coaches would prefer their defenders didn't, or at the very least not get caught while doing so, for the least savory of them.

You absolutely have the right to have a different interpretation, because a lot of what refereeing is about is just that, you have to interpret a situation and oftentimes opposite decisions on the same situation can both be receivable.

You even have the right to have a wrong interpretation of the situation according to the laws of the game. This will only make you wrong, but that's no big deal I suppose, what's one more guy spouting whatever goes through his head when it comes to refereeing. I suppose it's difficult to make the sorry state of the debate around refereeing worse than it already is.

As far as this situation is concerned though, the ref's call is nowhere near scandalous, and at the very least, according to the laws of the game, not to your homemade rules such as ""this is a contact sport"", I'm pretty sure the ref made a correct call. And a referee is not here to make calls according to your homemade rules, he's here to enforce the laws of the game, period."
"Yes, my point exactly."
"He is loyal to our FA, so they rewarded him with CL match. He was 4th official for Arsenal - Real Madrid match.

Everyone in Bosnia knows, if he's chosen for a specific match it's because on of the teams will need help. It's kind of insane because he can be very good when he's not there to 'fix it'."

I bet that first train from Falmer back to Brighton was pretty fucking quiet."
unbelievable
FUCK YES GET IN SON
Unbalebable goal tbh
From Center back as well. What a hit
Now that's a remontada
West Ham have been extremely lucky this season to avoid relegation.
Goofy ahh keeper
That's my fucking KING
Natural center back clearly
Baleba CB TOTW we will be there
God damn that commentating in Spanish is peak
The height he gets on that backflip is insane
What a guy.
That commentator brings soo much joy
One of the most casual worldies you'll see this season
What an absolutely stunner and ridiculous end to the game.
Scoring that and celebrating like that after playing 90 minutes. Mental.
We were far too happy about the Spurs and united positions
THATS MY CB
Baleba is just a better caicedo there I said it
(Great-Goal) (Great-Celebration) (Great-Commentary)
Jesus Christ
He’s got proper talent. What a screamer!
/u/Cruxed [stay away from Baleba](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1k8cxtk/post_match_thread_chelsea_10_everton_english/mp5muw5/)
Why didn't the keeper make an effort? Shot wais from 30 - 35 yards.
Surely you gotta at least move if you're the keeper?
"Absolute cinema, I really hope Brighton can play in Europe next year. 🤍🩵"
Jesus Christ. I am lost for words just how poor we are. I didn’t think things could get worse from JLo but they have got so much worse. The club is an absolute shit show. Potter is so fucking useless
What a strike
"Fucking hell Brighton, take one for the team!"
"What a hit, I almost lost my eyebrows"
Forever blowing bottles
Class commentary that like!
gave him all the time in the world
gotta write: [great commentary]
Tag this with great goal plus great commentary fantastic 
west ham out bottling brighton. crazy scenes
What a strike
That went it like a snail 🐌
Can’t believe I’m relieved that West Ham have lost so that we can maintain our grip on…15th.
"I actually think he might be better than Caicedo, which would be absurd tbh"
Am i high or was this also a shit job by the GK? I feel like a good one saves that
"That celebration was some ProClubs level business, everyone doing their own thing. Love it 😂"
lets freaking go
Love how they all start running in random directions after the goal. Great celebration
Made that look so easy
"Great goal. Unforgiveable, pathetic defending."
You know it's a banger when even Fabian is skipping up and down the pitch lmao
See potter is thriving.
"Fuck it, welcome back Coutinho"
"Fucking awful performance this whole match. We are lucky that West Ham are bigger bottlers and we have world class talent such as Mitoma and Baleba. They will be gone in the summer, for sure."
Yes. I need West Ham to go DOWN and stay down. Thank god for that goal. Now West Ham can hopefully get send in a further downward trajectory towards the very bottom.
What he say
Man I hate my club.
"You guys were singing in support of him throughout the whole game.

> The German’s right, you’re fucking shite!"
And the commentating as well was top quality.
We've been blessed with so many bangers this month and we still have a few more games tomorrow. We could be looking at a December 2006 esque goal of the month compilation
Holy shit the AMEX sounded like a volcanic eruption you could hear the sound dampening on the broadcast
Remembered lua lua
I watched the entire second half just to miss the last 8 minutes because my dog was sick. Sigh. At least hes okay now.
Thought it was over after West Ham went up to 2. Last few minutes of brilliance though.
"Scared, Potter?"
"With 36 points they wouldve been safe for the last 5 seasons as well(didnt check more) so idk about that.

Edit: OK they wouldve been relegated in 2015 with 36 points thats 10 years ago Aware."
"To be fair, so are Spurs and Man U"
Yes we are. Fingers crossed the 3 that come up are equally as shite as I don’t see us getting better anytime soon 😫⚒
"If we had Potter the whole season on the form we've had since he joined, we'd be down."
So are spurs and man U
"They were all frothing to get rid of Moyes because the football wasn’t ’exciting enough,’ after winning the conference league. Wonder how that’s working out"
Paging Dr Tottenham
"lol small world but I randomly came across your reddit profile on a seagull video. I clicked on your profile to see if you were cosplaying as a seagull and lo and behold you've commented on a West Ham goal! Massive Hammers fan here, really bummed with the result this morning"
"Can always trust a Cameroonian to put in a job at center back, it's our specialty"
He’s fantastic wherever he plays on the pitch.
not this coming from a united fan 😭
"Watch the replay, bend and dip was insane"
"There's people leaving early on a Saturday afternoon? I kind of understand wanting to leave early in an evening fixture, but it's not like there's any need to rush back. There will be trains all day I imagine."
Was trying to explain to GF just how fuckin wild a hit like that is from a CB lol
This is every week
You could say the same for Spurs and United which is a lot worse considering not only the size and expectations of those clubs but how much money they've spent just to get worse
West Ham should be grateful that there are three teams more shit than them this season; absolute relegation form.
"These prats have managed to beat us away from home two years in a row too, even worse when we've pasted them in both of the reverse fixtures 😭"
Baleba Beleba! bellleebaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA^AAAAAAAA
Might be the most all around athletic guy in the prem
Chelsea directors salivating right now.
"Keeper does poorly, defence also come to shut him down way too late. I know it’s the 93rd minute, but you need to be sharper than that in the top flight"
how did i read that as could get worse from jennifer lopez 😭 apologies
Fired Lopetegui to get English Lopetegui.
Maybe it’s not the managers? Give potter a preseason at least.
How has Wan-Bissaka been this season?
"I'd say it's typical commentary from this guy. Argentinian in ESPN, can't remember his name though."
It looks easier to save or slower on TV. It was curling like a demon into the top left and there was literally zero chance he’d get it from his position 
"Judging by the way you guys have recruited, you probably already have replacements set up for them both. I wouldn't worry too much. Not to mentioned if they do leave, it won't be for less than £100 million between the 2 of them."
"I think Mitoma will remain with you guys for the long run. Baleba could be gone in the summer, not many strong DMs in the market but not sure who will go for him, maybe Arsenal?"
"I must have been at a different game because I wouldn’t say it was awful for the whole match. Yes there were moments we were bad. The last 20 or so minutes of the first half we weren’t great and we did take a while to wake up in the second. 

But all West Ham did was capitalise on our mistakes and catch us on the counter with pace. It’s not like they controlled the game and had a lot of chances. They barely troubled Bart and, outside of the two goals we conceded, I can only remember one save he had to make."
Wanna spend another 118 mil ?

Sounded like an air alarm lol
No regrets bro. Your dog is more important than some irrelevant Pl match in the grand scheme of things.
Don't worry the were a fair few people around me that left early after we conceded the 2nd goal so didn't even get to see the last 8 minutes either!
"3 points to...oh, wait"
10 points out of the 36 are against them so
Carlos Tevez West Ham was 43 pts I blv
"I'll always be sad about the fact that if it wasn't for the bottom 3 being as godawful as they are this season, these two clubs could have been seriously threatened with relegation. God, imagine both of them going down the same season"
Seeing the goat Matip will forever make that statement true 💚🦒
Oh my god. Just got flashbacks of Alex Song playing center back for Arsenal
Saying that as if the utd fan himself plays gk
No deflection. Just a major bend around some players.
Yep no way he is getting near
"In their defense, the waiting in the train station can be improved. They need to add more transits, especially after the game."
He played CB today
while they are shit and them getting relegated would have been extremely funny theyre still well on track to get 40+ points which is almost always safe.
Horrific season but realistically we probably end up getting 40 points so it's not like we are doing historically bad or anything
[Gonna tell my grandkids this is how the table really ended up](https://imgur.com/a/fXi4rcR)
"Lopetegui is honestly better than Potter, which isn’t saying much but we’ve slumped from 13th to a near relegation battle"
Haha...2nd place again ole ole
The players are absolutely useless too barring Bowen and AWB they are all for sale according to the club which is not surprising
The lone bright spot this season next to Bowen
Someone might.
Man I thought he was great in the euros what happened to him??
"I've said this before and it's still true - Potter is a hack. He's not a PL quality manager and is only hanging around because of one decent season with Brighton when they had Mac Allister, Cucurella, Caicedo and Trossard all in their starting XI."
Thought my speaker malfunctioned for a while there.
That was Spanish
My father will hear about this
Not sure my heart can take that amount of excitement 😂
The championship suddenly becomes a lot more entertaining than the prem
"Everton were pretty shit too before Moyes' return. In another universe Everton, United, and Spurs all go down."
"I just experienced this today with a day trip to Lewes ending as this game was kicking out, it was packed and you could tell they struggle. No extra trains are put on, it could be be very improved as you say."
And they have a shot on still qualifying for CL via winning Europa.
"Whos well on track to get 40+ points?

Spurs finish with Liverpool, West Ham,  Crystal Palace, Aston Villa, and Brighton

Manchester United finish with Bournemouth, Brentford, West Ham, Chelsea, and Aston Villa

Both clubs are also concentrating solely on the Europa League"
"“Not historically bad” is something, at least"
"Haven't watched any of you lot, can you at least kinda see what Potter is trying to do or is it just poor without any sense of what the gameplan is?"
Funny because West Ham would bring out a statue if their manager got second just once.
Felt bad watching him collapse after that went in - he was the scariest player on the pitch for West Ham.
The annual Michail Antonio curse
"The West Ham striker curse.

I read an article, that listed all West Ham strikers the last 15 years - and I believe only Antonio and Carton Cole were somewhat succesfull."
"I'm sorry but this is dumb. West Ham's issues obviously run deep, Potter has been there since January. How can you possibly try to blame all this on him."
Disagree. To blame West Ham's issues on Potter is obscene.
Who did he have in Östersund then? The mighty Ken Sema? Or maybe midfield giant Tom Pettersson?
Thought I was watching F1 cars on the starting grid
Your father ! I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair boy !

"Would have 2. Bundesliga vibes, with all those former champions"
Wolves were worse under O'Neill.
"When you compare times to get away from stadiums across the country, it’s not that bad. The difference is you have to stand still for a lot of the time, which feels much much longer than it really is. If you’re moving it feels like progress even if the overall journey is the same length."
"Because we're west ham ya donut. We're not the high and mighty goon king themselves 🙏🙏. The gooners never win trophies, they leave them for others to enioy. What great people they are."
Genuine highway robbery to get him for 15 million off of United. He’s one of the few players I wouldn’t ship off to Antarctica
"Ah yes, some *deep* lore."
"Antonio was signed initially as a winger, same with Arnautovic who IMO did very well in his short time upfront"
"How dare you use logic. 

Don't you understand that the manager is always to blame?"
Is....that a student?!!?!?
"Literally the third most successful team in English division history but I'm sure you were too busy blowing bubbles to notice 🕊️

West Ham fans can't even give the big 'un to Tottnum fans 😭"
Glad to hear he's done well. Thanks for responding.
"Yeah, Arnie was rather decent.

But damn, there were some stinkers through the years. All the SCAMaccas, Ings, Zazas and Hallers of the World."

Imagine 40m was spent on maxi Gomez who not even at 30 is already back in Uruguay. The scouting never ceases to amaze

"3rd most league titles and most FA Cup trophies in the country ya melt.

"Imagine being one of the highest revenue generating clubs in the world and being unable to compete based on a transfer value.

God we've been mismanaged so fucking atrociously it's sad."
I've wanted him at Bayern for nearly 3 years now. He has been the exact kind of keeper we've needed yet we keep getting keepers nowhere near the profile that is needed.
They need a smart Van der sar signing like a Sommer 
200m in January. How much do we think they'll spend over the summer? Another 200m?
Feels weird to see City go for Diogo Costa. Pep has been so specific regarding which goalkeeper he wants before. Diogo is not bad with his feet and his distribution is ok but I feel he’s more of a good allround keeper than a ball playing one.
Looks like Man Utd will gazump City again.
Man. Utd was interested in Diogo Costa a couple years ago but ended up getting Onana who had a great CL season with Inter.
"Reality is, I think we want a few players this summer and won’t be getting into bidding wars for a keeper. Especially if, for instance, we struggle to sell Onana too. We have limited funds, even if I do think we will be aiming for 150m after sales."
"I mean the debt as a lot do with that and like you said shocking money spent(1 Billion) which hasn’t amounted to anything, and certainly not stability"
"So much self-pity in the United fanbase these days. ""Oh woe is me, club can't compete for every single expensive signing in the world all the time, everyone should feel sad for us"".

The reason United can't financially compete for Costa today is because your club broke the transfer record to sign Onana last season. The fact that Manchester United can't keep signing the *most expensive keeper in the world* consecutively isn't sad, it's perfectly normal and expected. Regardless, they'll spend another £150-200m this summer, just like every other summer in recent memory."
"I'm not sure it's that black and white in this case. We've been linked with a lot of keepers over the last few days. Most of those have been young up-and-coming keepers you'd expect to be a better back-up than Altay and eventually challenge Onana for the starting spot. 

If we went for Costa, the money involved would mean he'd have to start, and that would only make sense if we got a fee for Onana that's just not coming this summer. 

We might be able to drop say £50m on Costa but is it that worth it at the expense of the other business that needs doing more? We need to sort out the attack, that looks like it's going to happen with Cunha and Delap. And then we need to look at wing back and midfield options. Shaw doesn't seem to be an option at LWB and imo Dorgu is a squad player and nothing more at this point. We don't know how Amass and Diego Leon are going to develop over the summer, and then on the right we've got Amad, Dalot and Mazraoui, none of whom are perfect fits for differing reasons. 

On top of that while I have enjoyed Bruno playing deeper, at some point he's going to break down and realistically we need to bring someone in who can carry the ball from that deep position. Do we try and turn Mount or Mainoo into that player, or hope Kone develops quick enough? Either way we'll need to sign someone there too. 

These are all crucial to delivering on Ruben's game model and if we can get that running consistently and reliably it should ease the pressure on Onana and maybe he starts making less mistakes. If not, we can then start looking for the goalkeeper to finish off a functioning team."
"I've always thought that you guys would be a fitting club for his career progression, but the Neuer presence in the squad was a factor against that kind of investment from Bayern."
Well let's hope Urbig steps up for that. He has shown good promise so far
How is Sommer a smart signing?
"Sorry for the other guy with the cry again, it should actually be even more than that, just depends on the outgoings, because if we get the offloading of Bernardo Silva, Kdb, and Grealish is already about a million pounds a week freed up. I personally think it could be up to 300m"
Yes and what are you going to do about it cry again ? Oh no how sad
The new Alexis and Fred 
There’s no guarantee Diogo becomes great at this United team even if he was signed 2-3 years ago
It’s not gonna happen because he doesn’t want to leave but how would he not be
Took that personally and got defensive didn't you!
Just trying to gauge how strong they will be next season...
"Can't be much worse than Onana, who has single handedly cost United multiple points and a Champions League run."
Are we talking about the same 36 year old Sommer for a team like United who is looking to rebuild stability and not a quickfix?
No I just find it funny this sub has a meltdown every time city spends money apparently we’re the only team in the world not allowed to rebuild this sub has a hissy fit over anything city
Fair enough
"Yes, who’s also one of the best goalkeepers in the world 

Even during a rebuild you need actual good players. Goalkeeper is like the one position you don’t always need to replenish with youngsters once you’ve got a decent one. Any young goalkeeper that you’re looking at in your price range is going to be worse than most of the veterans playing right now"
So you want to counter that energy by preemptively throwing a hissy fit yourself?
What a scam of a relegation battle
"Credit to them, back to back promotions, have a great manager and actually did decent away from home this year (if only they had a better home form) but to be the last one regulated when arguably they had the worst team.

I think they will be back sooner than later"
"Ipswich will do well next year, think it was maybe a step too far for them with back to back promotions,"
its April and the 3 promoted championship teams are already down
Cheers Ed Sheeran is crying rn
"Ipswich got promoted with a league 1 squad

They spent loads, but they've built themselves a solid squad for next season 

Plus they did the best out of all 3 promoted clubs which is fair fucks to them"
"The only one's out of the 3 who have any sense of pride about what they've done this season. 

The fact that the best promoted side this year was Ipswich and the best the year before was Luton just shows how much of a complete shambles the other 4 sides have been."
See you in 26/27
"Thank you very much. I’d like to thank Muric, his parents for birthing him, McKenna for playing him and his massive huge potato head and apparent ketamine addiction for fucking us. Shoutout Philogene as well for being the most forgettable record signing I’ve ever seen."
"Obviously very enjoyable they've crashed and burned as hard as we ever have after spending +130m after nearly 20 years of mediocrity.

But let's face it, they'll absolutely piss the championship next season with that squad, batter us, and at the very least become a dominant yo-yo club for the next few years."
the worst relegation battle in a while
Maresca gave these lots 4points
"Best thing I've heard as a west ham fan in months, apart from the Fullkrug interview."
"It was kind of refreshing to not hear much intense speculation (if any) surrounding the manager of a bound-to-be relegated team in Ipswich's McKenna this season, especially after the summer where there were rumours about him potentially leaving the club. It's not often that you find these teams relatively calm and not panicking and scrambling around trying to find any replacement to save themselves from the fate of relegation. 

Plus, given that they've planned for this eventuality looking at their recruitment from the past two windows, they must surely be well-equipped for a quick return."
"Honestly at the start of the season I was worried we'd break Derby's record.

Considering where we were 5 years ago we're still in a great position, but it was clearly too early for this squad to come up."
"Guess only thing left is european spots and to witness who out of West Ham, United and Spurs battle it out over who can be the worst out of three."
"Let it never be forgotten just how many points and how much momentum just Muric cost Ipswich.

Deserves to be hounded out of Ipswich."
"Hope they do well and come back up stronger in the future. Lost a few bets to their surprising results this season, thanks Chelsea"
"Promoting too soon, now time to build a stronger squad."
"Fuck off Ed Sheeran

Less jokey response: shame the relegation scrap.is fully over in April. Goddamn. Ipswich tried well but nowhere near the level long term, it's a damning indictment on the other 2 that they are 18th"
"Have to admit I was kind of hoping West Ham would have taken a point so Newcastle weren't the ones to send them down in the Sir Bobby derby.

Hopefully they'll be back within a season or two."
Bottom three finish with over -40 GD
Not surprising 
PretendsToBeShocked.jpeg
Ipswich switched to PL-2?
"The bottom three have been rightfully laughed at, but it is the second season in a row that there is a complete surprise promoted team, and they turn out to be the best fighting team in the relegation battle."
Ipswich fans - what's the expectation around McKenna?
Thank God….
Relegation battle was absolutely atrocious this season. 3 awful teams.
"*insert Bielsa looking confused* 

Did he ever learn how to say the name?"
Good riddance
League should be reduced to 18 teams. What a pathetic showing from promotion sides twice now. This would at least make relegation interesting again for midtable clubs like Spurs or Man United.
"Well, I hope we get goals out of their top boy"
/u/fakecinnamon lmao
"I read that as Newcastle at first, I thought I missed something "
"With the gap between the Prem and the EFL only widening, relegation battles will likely remain a scam for the foreseeable future"
Nothingburger title race too. Zero jeopardy on the final day. Feel like it was the same last year
That one goalkeeper they had I remember making a lot of mistakes
"They were in League One two seasons ago and still have loads of momentum. Fans having turned on the players, managers or new owners. 

They’ll lose Delap, but if they can keep hold of Hutchinson and Philogene they’ll be in and about the places to come straight back up"
Didn’t they keep their coach the whole season? I kept thinking it was a smart move if you just assume you are going back down and get that coach some great experience to take back and maybe come back up.
Or they can crash into a wall like Luton...
"Feel like everyone said that about Luton though, obviously worrying how many defeats can hit confidence"
Very close to the disaster scenario of the same 6 teams just rotating in and out every other year.  If there were 3 direct promotion spots and not a playoff we'd probably see it soon.
"Said this in the DD yesterday but there hasn't been a championship winner who hasn't been recently relegated from the PL in the past 6 seasons, the longest gap before that in the 2000s was 3 years. I didn't have the time to check but it's not unreasonable to think this is the longest we've ever gone without a long-term Championship participant winning.

The Premier League financial rules have formed a gulf between the PL and the Championship, and a 2nd gulf between teams recently relegated from the Premier League and other Championship teams. It's grim but I don't see things getting better either."
He'll get an entire album out of this season!
Same was said about luton last season
think mckenna is staying?
still smashed us at portman rd tbf
I'll miss you next season x
"I hadn't heard about the ketamine thing, but it would explain a lot."
"They've become the very thing they hate, Norwich."
"Delap will leave for sure 

Hutchisons maybe"
Until next year
Ange gave us 4 points as well
Not everything is about you.
Thank fuck the promoted teams have been so shite this year
"He’s already been mentioning next season in interviews, with a contract like what we’re paying him I hope he stays. I think we’ll end up like Luton if he leaves."
He who must not be named...
"They spent over £100m and this was the season they had. Pretty much tells you that it's not their fault, the system is broken."
What’s wrong with Ipswich 
"Fan of a state-owned sportswashing operation that spent their way out of mid-table with oil money: ""Who's making this league so uncompetitive! Why is the gap between the first and second division so big!"""
"Look at you following our results, you're welcome to buy a shirt and scarf from the club shop"
"One of these premier league clubs will eventually throw themselves into financial ruin trying to get European football, but at the same time half the championship is doing it to get to the premier league"
"From now on if a promoted team wants a chance of staying up, they're gonna have to take the Nottingham Forest approach. Break PSR rules from spending recklessly, take the points deduction, and just hope the players you've brought in make enough of a difference for it to be worth it."
"I agree that it has widened, but I don't think this season is a good barometer. Both Leicester and Southampton have been woefully mismanaged  and Ipswich just weren't ready for the PL promotion."
"To be fair, all three of the 21/22 promoted teams are still there and are now genuinely competitive"
Championship sides doing really shit has been an on and off thing for decades mind.
"That's a shortsighted view. Just 3 seasons ago, all three sides stayed up and now they're all in the top 10. Leeds have a strong chance of staying up next year and all it takes for weaker promoted sides is a financial implosion in wolves/west ham/Everton etc one year and they'll stay in above them."
"Is it that? Or is it that these teams have started coming up and tried to play expansive football that they clearly can't execute well enough to get results. Burnely and Luton last year, Southampton and Ipswich this year.. All of them were known to try and play ""the right way"" and look at what it got them.


These teams need to be more pragmatic. I don't know how Steve Cooper got sacked considering they were actually 16th at the time. I guess he wasn't expansive enough?"
"This season's an anomaly, last year the relegation battle went down to the last 2 games (3 teams were separated by 2 points with 3 games to go). This year was only so clear-cut because Southampton spent too long playing a way that wasn't working, then hired a manager that wouldn't work, Leicester appointed a manager that took them from scoring in 14 out of 15 games to scoring in 4 out of 29 games, and Ipswich (who should have been the most nailed on) were playing L1 football two years ago."
Isn’t that Muric who also made loads of mistakes last year for Burnley when they went down?
Where is the Muric seller guy when you need him?
"They signed many players last summer like Jack Clarke, Szmodics, Jacob Greaves, Dara O'Shea who probably haven't made a splash in the Prem but I know for a fact are great Championship players that can make up the spine of a title winning side.


Unless Sheffield United don't win the play-offs I think they'll top the league next season."
"Kieran Mckenna took them from League One to Prem, it would've been utter stupid to sack him. They will either keep him or sell him like Burnley did with Kompany."
"Ya they were never gunna sack McKenna really, he has a lot of goodwill at the club, the fans love him and they knew the squad was really thin and not prem standard anyway"
"Do you think that because of how bad they have been that the squads will remain mostly the same, further adding to the chance of 'yo-yoing'?"
"Don’t worry - we are a shambles, and our director of football is too. No danger of us coming back up, in fact we’ll donate a spot to another plucky team and be doomed to eternity in the championship."
This time maybe he'll finally graduate to calculus symbols now that he's done with basic arithmetic 
He seems keen to.
"Light work with Nkunku, Disasi and Felix honestly"
what's the ketamine thing?
"And seeing how they're slowly dropping down the table season after season with seemingly no ambition, Norwich appear to be becoming us circa 10 years ago as well."
"Nah, I think Burnley and Leeds are much better equipped to at least make a decent fist of it, unlike Southampton and Leicester who were hustled worse versions of their relegated squads."
But it’s all about you bud
Take a train there and find out
"You need the money tbf.   
Nah this popped up at the top of the sub since it's always a great laugh when a club like Ipswich go down this embarrassingly."
Everton were so close to doing that. Survived by the skin of their teeth.
worked out for Forest but can’t say it’s a replicable process
"> One of these premier league clubs will eventually throw themselves into financial ruin trying to get European football


Ahh, the good old days…"
I see Blyth Spartans almost didn't lose today.
You can't do that anymore with PSR. You're just going to end up getting points deductions and ruining it anyway.
"If a club does decide to bite the bullet and it doesn't work out? What are they supposed to do next? Because taking the plunge in a similar manner to Forest and they fail to guarantee safety then financial ruin is almost imminent

And it's not like the promoted clubs aren't stumping up cash at the seams either, Ipswich and Southampton both spend over 100M in transfer fees during the summer meanwhile Leicester spend over 80M as well. So it's definitely not for the lack of trying."
We didn't break PSR from spending recklessly. We received more money from selling Johnson after the deadline than we were offered before it in the same window and tried to argue it could be backdated. We would have passed if we'd sold for 30m in June instead of 47m in August.
"I do get this and I think you can say the same for the previous season - we were financially mismanaged, Luton weren't equipped for a Premier League campaign but did well regardless, and Burnley were a disappointment.

The problem is though, there are 17 clubs that, next season, will have been in the Premier League at a minimum of three consecutive seasons - essentially a £300m headstart on any promoted team.

Like I'd say West Ham are probably the weakest of the 17 at the moment, but they have Paqueta (55 Brazil caps), Bowen (16 England caps), Fullkrug (22 Germany caps), on top of players like Kudus, Soucek, Alvarez etc. Clubs coming up from the Championship simply can't compete with this."
"This is 2 years in a row now where we’ve known who’s going down since about November, and if you ignore that anomaly of a year in 22/23 it’s been trending this way for a while. I think we’re now at 10 or 11 of the last 15 promoted sides not just going straight back down but not even getting to 30 points in the process, I’m sorry but that’s concerning. Some of it is probably due to individual circumstances/mismanagement, but definitely not all of it. I don’t buy at all that if we hadn’t sold Ndiaye and Berge, if Leicester hadn’t appointed RVN, if Saints and Burnley were a bit more pragmatic, if Luton and Ipswich spent an extra 50m or whatever that things would’ve been any different, the gulf is so big

I don’t know who a promoted side is meant to be finishing above now. You’re probably looking at the likes of Wolves, West Ham, Everton, Palace etc selling a couple of key players and having a disaster season but even those sides are still stacked full of superstars and established internationals. I’m sat here now watching Palace in this cup semi thinking this a team that we potentially might need to finish above next year if we want to survive yet they are absolutely light years ahead of us. Any one of the players on the pitch for them now walks into our side and instantly becomes our best player. I don’t know how anyone is supposed to bridge this sort of gap in one season."
"I would've agreed with you if it wasn't for the fact that this has happened two seasons in a row. That isn't normal. All three promoted clubs getting relegated is incredible rare, and it's happened twice in a row"
"last year relegation battle was only thanks to points deduction, otherwise it wasn't close."
"Correct, however at least at Burnley Trafford was in over his head at the time so putting Muric back in made at least a bit of sense"
This kinda feels like a Deja vu statement of luton from last year hope im wrong for them but confidence means a lot
Yeah I think it was a smart move. Just seen so many instances as to where managers have been let go.
"A theory I heard is that its because most of the current the Premier League teams are run in a competent way.


Small teams like Fullham, Nottingham Forest or Brighton that you would expect in a relegation battle ten or even five years ago is run in a much more professional way. They have long term strategies made by highly competent people. 


The clubs that you would expect to be from 10th to 17th is simply much better on all levels and this makes it ofcourse much harder for newly promoted teams to get the points they need to survive."
"At least based on the past two seasons, it would seem so.

Relegated from 22-23:

Leicester City (promoted back after one season and immediately relegated)

Leeds United (in playoff last year, back this year)

Southampton (promoted back after one season, immediately relegated)

Relegated from 23-24:

Luton Town (In a relegation scrap)

Burnley (promoted)

Sheffield United (in playoff, just missed automatic promotion)

___

Granted, two seasons of evidence is not a huge sample size, but seeing how much better Burnley, Leeds, and Sheffield United are than the rest of the Championship* doesn't necessarily bode well.

\*And considering that last season's top 4 in the Championship were so much better than the rest, and then had historically bad seasons this year, it's not a good omen."
early new years gift from enzo marescer
I completely made it up but it’s probably true
"Whilst I wont deny we are very shite, we did finish in the playoffs only last season so not quite  ""season after season""."
"Look at me

I am the mediocre championship club now"
"Who do you see going down at their expense?

Wolves?"
Why are they? Leeds have sold most of their high profile players and replaced them with Championship players. And a worse manager. And an ownership group with tight purse strings.
"No you saw it and got all giddy to tag me because I must have left a big impression on you, I like roses for valentine's btw"
Pickford honestly deserves a statue. His world-class performances week in and week out in that relegation fight were the only thing standing between us and administration.
"I actually don't think Forest were trying to get European football they were just hell bent on not going back to the championship.

As you say, it's not going to pay off for everyone"
"Yeah that's as good as it gets right now.

Maybe in a couple seasons we will be down at our level and start to scrape draws"
"I mean and this is very important if you’ve scouted well inserted relegation clauses on salaries, it’s not imminent financial ruin. You could sell 2-3 good players that you bought and try again next year. Even being relegated from the prem is lucrative "
"And three season ago all three promoted clubs have stayed. And now all three of them are in top-10.


Also, it's not like Leicester and Ipswich were hopeless from the start
 After 19 games Leicester had 14 points, Ipswich - 15, Wolves - 16. Since then Leicester have scored 4 points, Ipswich - 6, Wolves - 25."
"In one of those seasons, it went down to the last 2 games (technically the last game because of GD) and was only sealed at that point because Forest played - and beat - two of the three teams below them in the last three games of the season. If Forest hadn't beaten Sheffield United, it quite easily could have been 2 of 3 promoted going down."
"How much of that is down to the managers.

Fullham, Bournemouth and Forest all survived 2 seasons ago, but Forest and Bournemouth both played counter attacking football and tried to grind out results.

All of the promoted teams in the last 2 seasons have stuck to their Championship style, trying to control possession and play out from the back, and have been punished because of that."
"I agree.

If you come up and fancy your chances, who is your target? I guess it's hoping Everton, Wolves or West Ham have a really poor season, but even then you're looking at probably 36 points bare minimum to survive?

It's a tall order. I fancy all 3 to go back down again next year.

Honestly the best chance (if it's an option open to a club) is to spend like mad and take the points deduction."
"Cool, doesn't change the fact that it was close. Not like Forest were deducted lots either. The relegation battle still would have taken until the 36th match week, even with those 4 extra points. So, the points deduction equated to the relegation battle ending one week later."
Ipswich have a significantly stronger squad than Luton in my opinion.
"Luton were a squad of journeymen and still are. Hutchinson, Clarke, Philogene, Greaves etc are all better players than anyone Luton have had over the last few years."
"Yeah, it does seem like there's kind of a in-between league with Burnley, Leicester, Leeds, Southampton and Sheff United with one other club that can compete."
Yeah tbh I'm trying to manifest something here.
"Wolves and maybe West Ham. Could also see someone like Brentford struggle if they get their manager pinched by Spurs, perhaps.

I think they’ll struggle, of course, but I think they’ll at least make a fight of it. I hope so anyway."
West Ham is on borrowed time unless they sack Potter. Wouldn't be surprised to see them in 19th by October before they sack him.
"There's a good chunk of 6 or 7 teams who if they lose a couple of key players through being sold or injury and lose their manager they could suddenly slip down the table. It still requires Farke/Parker to step up and for our recruitment to be very good, obviously, so we'll obviously be favourites to go down and rightly so, but I think these past couple of seasons have made people forget that it's pretty easy for a bad summer window to happen and to go from midtable to suddenly being nervous about relegation. I mean, look at West Ham going from 9th to 17th between last season and this and it's only the bottom 3 being so awful that's made them avoid any kind of relegation battle."
"We have the bones of a better squad with more players ready to make the step up, and a better wage structure having had two years of clear out, leaving us with *significantly* more room to spend. Leicester went up on the verge of financial collapse if they didn’t, and even with the premier league money most of it just filled a hole that was already there.

Survival will still be a tough ask, but we’re definitely in a better position now than the Leicester and Southampton were last year."
"Pickford could have forced a move years ago and hasn’t. Deserves a lot of praise for staying with them. Would have easily been number one at Man United, Spurs, Chelsea or even Arsenal"
I think the goal was European football but they’re ahead of schedule.
Seems like the new manager is making a positive impact? Hopes for next season? I must get to a few more games next season. I haven't made as many as I'd like this year.
"It's mad that we seem to be simultaneously low block shithouses, and naively sticking to our guns from last season, depending on which team we've just played or which pundit is talking about us.

We came up too early, there's not much else to it."
"It’s also down to shitty transfers. Leicester wasted millions on Okoli, Skipp, and Ayew, and got unlucky with Fatawu’s injury. Burnley failed to buy a competent keeper last season (Trafford wasn’t ready last year and Muric was diabolical.) Luton and Ipswich were just not ready."
"> Fullham, Bournemouth and Forest all survived 2 seasons ago, but Forest and Bournemouth both played counter attacking football and tried to grind out results.

I've said it before, but people have to realise that this only confirms the gap widening. Both Fulham and Bournemouth had squads built with premier league money, and were on parachute payments in the champ, whilst Forest literally just broke the spending rules to stay up. This isn't the indicator of health that it's made out to be"
"I mean, Brentford absolutely did that and they are doing fine."
"I have (perhaps blind) optimism that if ipswich get promoted again next season, we might be in a good position to stay up. We bought a lot of young talented players that haven't quite been good enough, coupled with a bottom half of the league that is probably at its strongest in many years. If the majority of those players stay next season, have a year playing well together, and then come back to the prem two years older and more experienced than the last time that could stand us in good stead."
"Overselling it much? He's an average keeper, above average shot stopper and below at everything else."
"I sure hope so, the takeover is promising as well. Hopefully we can stabilize next year.

I live in Canada now so haven't gone to a match in ages. All news I get these days are online or from a couple mates who sometimes go to home matches"
"There were a couple of points today where we won the ball high because you were trying to play from the back.

But I agree you came up too quickly. Hopefully you will be back before too long."
"If you can keep that squad more or less together, it's got a chance, there's always a chance.

But a path to 38 points just looks really difficult."
Stopping shots is the main job of a keeper
"Honestly, you ask any goalkeeper, and they praise Pickford to kingdom come. You can tell when someone doesn't understand the position when they criticise certain players."
"Agreed, and what will be lost in the discussion about the bottom 3 is that 4th from bottom will likely be on 40+ points by the end of the season. 

So even if we had a better transfer window, less injuries, and more luck with refereeing decisions, we might still have gone down with a points total that would be enough to survive most seasons."
"His ball playing ability does put a ceiling on what kind of level he could play at, but he's definitely worthy of some sort of regular European competition."
And he’s good at playing the ball too. People just meme on him bc he injured Van Dijk and because the number one rule of being an England fan is to hate your #1 keeper
To be a top level keeper it's not enough.
"Distribution poor, doesn't command the box and is always likely to throw a clanger. Not sure how anyone can disagree with those facts."
"Yeah, that's the worrying thing for me, the gap is just so big now.

The other issue is that the teams that come up and go down can just have their decent players nicked, so have to rebuild, which isn't easy when with money to spend.

Although it does mean that even if Sunderland do finally manage to come up, we likely won't have to put up with them for very long."
">the number one rule of being an England fan is to hate ~~your #1 keeper~~ the squad

FTFY"

"Championship's going to be a different ballgame when they get there. Squad definitely needs to tighten up a notch in that regard. Nonetheless, hats off"
Vardy incoming..
They are doing a fifa career mode.
"""Money doesn't buy happiness""

Meanwhile:"
"The diabetes-inducing Disney+ vibe about it all aside, it’s a genuinely feel good story.

Shit, get one of these Yank investors/owners on 606 or ITV co-comms. Would probably make a load more sense than Sutton or Dixon."
"Congrats the fans honestly but it’s like PSG or Man City dominating their leagues for the past decade+, outspending majority if not all of the other teams in the league certainly helps"
"I’m definitely a bandwagon fan but so happy for this historic club. Will be great to see them in the Championship. Honestly think the Cinderella story will stall for a bit. This team is mid-table in the Championship, at best. Will take massive investment to make it to the Premier League and to eventually stay there."
Pray they get stuck in the Championship or relegated and we'll see how long the show and owners stick around for
How many millions is their true underdog story?
The real story here though is Stockport county. In Wrexhams shadow but have basically had the same journey and could still get promoted to the championship in playoffs
"Wow. Lol, why am I getting downvoted? It actually is impressive they’ve done this."
I swear I read this about Wrexham in their every promotion
Skittles Aviation Gin
What a shout that is
"When they buy mcallister, Gyokeres and vitinha and wins the premier league do they still get to spin this as an underdog story in the documentary? 😂"
"You forgot fame, money and fame "
Meanwhile money could also destroy them. A lot of ryan reynolds money is having to go towards his idiot wife's lawsuit. She could truly ruin a great thing they've done.
Dixon sounds like he hates football and is being forced to commentate on the games for the rest of his life or his family will be killed because he has just that much enthusiasm
"Anyone who has an issue with what Wrexham is doing are simply against the concept of private ownership of football clubs in general.

And I'm one of them who's against private ownership of clubs in general, but there's no more morally justifiable way of doing it than what the Wrexham owners are doing, they've made their wealth ethically and are using it to not only prop up the football club but are investing into the local community as well."
I think they were the third biggest spenders (£5 million) - only Birmingham and Huddersfield were better
Not even close. Comparing two actors to two countries filled with blood money isn’t the same.
Feels bitter coming from a ManU fan…
"People said it when they joined League 1, but they recruited well. Recruiting for the Championship will be harder though, because they will be against a lot more teams with more money and parachute payments."
"Everybody was saying they'd do well in League 2 because teams the teams who do well in the NL often do well when they get promoted, and they were already buying League 1 and 2 level players at that point.

 This one is legitimately impressive though as I still thought on paper they weren't that much stronger than the teams around them. I do think defensively they could really struggle in the Championship without proper investment in the backline and I'd have my doubts about Parkinson at this level. It'll be interesting to watch."
Competing against former PL side on parachute payments and big championship sides is probably a bigger task than playing League 1-2 even though what they done is really impressive 
Let's hope.. It would be awesome!
I for one am boycotting the doc in that scenario
"Both of whom were in the Championship last season with the bigger income that's associated with that. Whereas Wrexham were just promoted last season and the season before that were in the National League. And their wage budget is currently £3.4 million higher than the 4th highest in the league. It's the actual epitome of financial doping, but because it's a lower league club with famous Hollywood owners and a good PR company rather than a Premiership club it's seen as a fairytale story rather than just the capitalist fantasy it actually is."
Life is very enjoyable for me tbh
"I think they'll keep Parkinson going into the season to give him a chance after how well he's done so far but if they struggle or finish mid table he's probably gone. 

These celebrations are kind of bittersweet because you see all the players celebrating that will soon be let go from the squad.

I don't know what to predict for them next season but I can't imagine they finish in the top 5 of the championship."
If they finish mid table he’s gone?
And in other news we are now ready to listen to offers north of £36m for Jean-Clair Todibo
"He was one of the best CB’s in Ligue 1 alongside a 56 year old Dante, what the hell happened"
Feels a bit steep but idk
£76m CB pairing of Todibo and Max Kilman
£36m? What? I hope Barca gets a % of this :D
Great deal. He wasn’t utilized to his best ability this year but for west ham this is as good as it gets for a defender. I’m am expecting him to perform top 6 level next year.
Gotta give players more than one season before you can judge them
40 years old Dante is still one of the best if he is partnered with someone that can do all the running for him.
Should have got Dante
Assume it's possibly related to us wanting to buy him but being disallowed. This was probably roughly the price we were looking to buy for.
Barca make around 8m I believe.
Man ain't been watching the same Todibo as the rest of us.
"This is /r/soccer, the most we can give them is one game."
"Yeah, I wasn't particularily impressed with Gabi XL during his first season here. He came in Oct 20 and didn't look really good until like the 22/23 season"
Ahhh the Casemiro way
If they fuck up the first touch it's over.

"How many times does Olmo need to die before RM gets a yellow,  lol?"
So can Yamal charge Ceballos with child abuse??
"Got to love modern football, where you're incentivised to make mountains out of molehills to get an advantage over your opponent.

^^^And ^^^by ^^^love ^^^I ^^^very ^^^much ^^^mean ^^^hate."
can someone also post the clear pen that wasn't given for the rugby tackle on Cubarsi?
"Imagine if this was Vinicius, if i speak i am in trouble..."
Ref is so afraid of giving calls against them it's amazing
"Yeah, it was a slap by Ceballos but Yamal is learning the ways"
Ref is definitely threatened lmao A clear penalty  was not given for barca
"I'm as big of a fan of Yamal as the next one and Ceballos is a dirty cunt but falling over like that is pathetic. Doesn't change the fact that real is playing dirty af and should have a couple more yellows, maybe even a red for tchouamenis tackle on olmo."
Yamal going down like he was hit by Eubank
"I adore him, but Lamine needs to stop playacting, not the first time I've seen him dive/exaggerate."
They cant play football so might as well turn this into a WWE match
"One of the few things I can agree with the commentator, Lamine Yamal is too good for these antics."
Its crazy how much shit Real have gotten away with in this half
People here acting like every footballer wouldn't fall down like that if half that contact was made. Players are incentivised in modern football to overreact so the situation gets noticed. Blame the game not the man.
"Doesn’t matter, rudiger should have already been sent off but he doesn’t even have a yellow card. If he doesn’t get one today then this whole thing is rigged. Ref also didn’t bother to look at the incident where cubarsi could have scored a goal but asencio held him by the shirt for a solid 10 sec."
Embarrassing.
all my homies hate ceballos
"goddamn what has yamal done to his hair

maybe its been like this for ages but wow it looks shit"
Ceballos hit him yes but Yamal is learning from his idol i see
embarrassing
No card given*
Ceballos skins his lips and he acts like he got hit with a hammer 😂
When will we start getting people carded over those fake reactions...
Can never be the best if you’re doing stuff like this
Wait people are defending Yamal? Lmfao. Beyond embarrassing falling over like that from somebodies fingers grazing your face.
"So unnecessary from ceballos but that reaction from yamal is embarrassing, ceballos fingers barely touched him"
"Clear yellow for Ceballos again forgiven, same for Asencio and Lucas."
"Can’t point this out, expecting Real Madrid to be held to the same standard as everyone else is victimising them. They are the world’s most oppressed club after all. /s"
Fallon d'floor winner
Crazy that people are jumping thru hoops to defend Yamal here
"You know it's real when they gently dab the place they have been 'hit' like they're applying make up and look at their fingertips afterwards to check for blood.

Fucking twat behaviour."
Embarrassing for Yamal
Fucking scum
streamin is fucking ass. broken
Let Vini do that and it's the most upvoted post on this site
Yamal Valors 
espn commentator was having a laugh saying olmo was catching all the stray kicks out there
"Love Lamine but it's obvious he learnt from his idol Neymar 😂
Just hoping he doesn't pick up the bad habits and learns the drive from Messi."
Fallon d' floor nominee The Child
"Dude, whatever Madrid was trying to pull yesterday is clearly working today. How haven't there been any bookings so far for Rudiger and Ceballos? It's beyond stupid!"
But I thought the refs were against RM? 🤡
this is pussy shit from both players.
What a dive lmao
I am neymar jr
Fucking pussy
clear and obvious penalty.
That’s a disgusting eye poke
"That's a red 100% of the time. It's clear violent conduct to slap someone across the face.

Real Madrid's antics off-field are having on-field consequences."
Ref is clearly rattled by the pre game shenanigans... absolutely shameless
"I don’t love diving but I see what Lamine is after, he’s trying to protect himself since the ref is failing too. This is getting ridiculous."
Negreilona with the dives again… Made in La Masia indeed
Proper dive that
The La Masia special!
All that crying helped.
"Would need to see it again but it looked a clear cut pen to me from that corner that nearly went in.

These cunts are getting away with murder."
The referee is  clearly scared of giving decisions against Real Madrid.
He needs to break his leg or go to hospital.
Just one question how has ceballos avoided a yellow card
"Maybe because refs are absolute dogshit, just like how he didn’t catch this incident ?"
Perez might get their reddit account banned for “bias” if they posted that
"What about the hand ball too

E- shouldn’t all the Madrid fans in my inbox be busy sending death threats to referees"
"Never a penalty, when both players are doing it"
"The one at the far post on the corner, when they're both pulling and grabbing and fouling each other? That's not a penalty."
It was posted several times and mods kept on deleting it for some reason. They finally kept it up after half the comment section was calling them out.
He actively stopped him from playing it by pulling his shirt - unless they murder a barca player on the pitch no cards or pens.
"Offside

Edit: sorry, thinking of the Vinicius one"
"Like when Maignan almost killed him?

Yeah I remember."
The difference is that Ceballos actually slaps Yamal on the mouth. Vinicius would’ve gone down holding his face just from the argument.
Ignore this pathetic drama instead of incentivizing it and it goes away.
Slap? More like a fingernail grazed lamines face
So he should just take it and dont care if Ceballos gets punished?
"When u play Madrid u learn from the best,Also ceballos should be on a yellow"
Obviously it's embarrassing but the fact that you can slap your opponent with no repercussion *unless* you exagerrate is also pathetic.
"> Yeah, it was a slap by Ceballos"
Diving will always exist when refs miss calls....Or when clubs can broadcast referee hit pieces on national TV.
"That’s exactly why he’s done it, Madrid are getting away with a lot and it’ll take something like this for anything to get called."
"Its pathetic but unfortunately, thats what players have to do for a every contact.

But the bigger question for me: how did ceballos not get a yellow for yeeting the ball away?"
The blonde hair brought out more Neymar than we expected lol
He literally got hit in the eye and mouth by a player slapping him?
Idk if you guys actually watch football or what. If players don't exaggerate they don't get attention and then end up not getting the foul. Yamal did exaggerate but still should have been a yellow.
"he is not calling clear fouls and cards, all of the campaigns from madrid has its impact "
It's still childish and shitty. Then again Lamine is a child so he should get a pass lol
Gotta get the cameras on you and make it obvious. Grown ahh man slapping a child lol
> Ceballos hit him yes
Us Madrid fans hate that shit too. It’s so fucking embarrassing
If someone hit me in the lips id also want him to get punished.
"A hand to the face is a card, sometimes red.

Where was the card, here?"
"The thing is they do this for ref to see and give a yellow. If he didn't Yamal didn't go down the ref wouldn't give the yellow card... Oh, wait"
Yamal exaggerates but off the ball swipe at someone’s face should be a red card
"And ceballos should walk scrap free?
Bro assaulted a minor lol
Learning from asencio i see👀"
Saka vs Real Madrid 2023/24 would win it
He was clearly hit in the face by Ceballos
We can easily see who is getting favored by the refs Ceballos should be on a yellow and Vini should stop whining
smartest real mardrid fan boi
He literally was
"He obviously touched his face lol. He definitely dived, but there is no need to lie man"
Definitely whacked in the face. Both parties in the wrong here.
he's wearing the real madrid crest that's why
"What's Yamal doing up in Ceballos' grill the first place? Got no right to try and grab the ball off Ceballos after all, it's the ref's job to sort out that throw-in. 

And it's hardly like Ceballos deliberately hit him either, so I don't quite see the fuss to be honest: Neither are covering themselves in glory, both are being shitheads, and as a ref you either grab them both for a talking to and possibly a yellow or you just leave them be."
"It's always that little rat Ceballos aswell. I remember two derbies just in recent years when he should have been sent off and somehow stayed on. Copa del Rey quarter final in 2022/23, Atleti were 1-0 up with like fifteen minutes left and Ceballos commits a clear dangerous foul whilst on a yellow. Stays on the pitch and then they go on to win

Or the derby this season at Bernabeu. Absolute stonewall straight red card challenge from Ceballos early in the game but no one even mentioned it afterwards. Meanwhile all the focus was on the penalty Atleti received, which was not controversial at all in comparison

That club is such a fucking joke. They have the refs in their pocket and control the whole of Spanish football, yet they have the absolute gall to act like there is a campaign against *them*"
"Naah, handball would have been much. The ball was going nowhere, he was flying at full speed and 1m away. I'd give it a pass"
"Supporting hand, not a pen, we don't need to look for bias everywhere it's pathetic"
"These handballs are commonly not given, it's completely fair."
Not a pen by the rules.
"He was breaking his fall, behave"
For me that was a clear pen
Typical Barca fan knowledge lol
You just be joking. Cubarsi had the position completely won. He just needed to push the ball in. Ceballos wasn't even looking at the ball.
Literally the same thing happened while kounde got a header from the corner too. Both have been using corners as bonding sessions
On a corner?
Ferran didnt touch it it cant be offside
Off a corner?
How was Cubarsi offside? What?
Ya that light graze of his lip caused him to roll around on the ground lol. Absolutely shameless to defend this
"Rudiger should have a yellow, Vazquez should have a yellow, Asencio should have a yellow. Think Vazquez could've had a red even by now."
"Yellow for Rudiger for tactical foul, yellow for Asencio for the tackle in the last minutes, yellow for Tchoumeni(?) for the tackle on Olmo that almost injured him."
"He got slapped in the face, but there was a clear pen earlier that wasn’t called. And the fact that Madrid should have 7 yellows by now"
Not talking about this incident
He literally hit him in the face????? No contact to the face is acceptable and is an instant card ALWAYS. What are u even talking about?
"In this case, no need for a card. But a lot of 50/50 going Real's way and the fact that neither Ceballos nor Rüdiger got carded is a bit funny to me."
nah he hit him in the eye bro
He still exaggerated it and got nothing 😭
"Oh yeah, definitely. Not trying to one up the other considering both sides here are acting questionable at best"
"Ceballos' fingers graze his face after he threw the ball. 


Yamal is rolling around on the floor"
"Oh no his fingers grazed my face, better collapse and roll on the ground"
"Your legs don’t buckle like that when the wrestling jobber gives you the eye rake. 

*edit - extra ‘you’ removed "
Call the cops immediately.
"I’ve hit my little brother way worse snd he never went down like that. It’s embarrassing when players fall to the floor like Yamal did there. With that said, it’s definitely a yellow for Ceballos."
It should have been a yellow for Lamal's dive. 
Idk man but getting scraped in my face is not gonna make me fall down and roll around on my back
"Legit, if it weren't for them, the ref wouldn't be afraid to give yellows to Real. For goodness sake, I counted like three tackles from the back that didn't get a yellow!"
I reaaaaaally don't think you're in the majority
Nah. Ceballos’ first name is Daniel as well. 
">Saka Vs Real Madrid 2023/24

That would be tough he didn't play against them"
Saka never played Madrid before this season
Still a dive
Still dived
Both can still be true
Come on bro we all saw that. That doesn’t mean he has to drop to the ground writhing in pain like he was shot or something.
"What the hell ? That was barca’s ball to play, ceballos is the one keeping it without reason. And how exactly wasn’t that deliberate ?"
I agree. They've been pretty consistent on hands being in that position during a slide.
Sure probably right but I’d like to see a post for discussion
Clearly clueless.
Shouldn't you be sending death threats to Burgos Bengoetxea's  family along with your fellow Madridistas?
You can clearly see both players pull on each others shirt.
This thread is so blinded by hatred for Madrid
He also hit his eye?
Borderline red on the olmo tackles
"Oh yeah my hand always goes down with acceleration when I lightly throw a ball. Ceballos knows what he's doing there, you're either daft or blind if you don't see that

nvm just seen your comment history. Where's the Madrid flair?https://media.tenor.com/LmtRMacuausAAAAM/carvajal-crying.gif"
"Oh no a player does what everyone's been doing for the last 30 years, better pretend I'm shocked! They do it cause it works, and will continue doing it until the rules change to retroactively punish dives. And yeah, I bet \*you\* wouldn't like it if someones ""fingers grazed your face"" like that."
please try that with someone with longer nails and we’ll talk
"well you're not exactly allowed to deck someone on the pitch in retaliation either, so not a lot of options there"
Nah His first name should be scum
"Im taking it all back
Bayern Munich it was Bayern"
"You can read? 
23/24"
"And i'm pretty fucking sure he did 
You idiot 
He literally scored vs them this year
MONTH"
"Even with the dive, the deserved card was not given...

See why they dive now?

Awful ref."
One is actively going for the ball. The other is just holding. You're coping.
This sub is in hatred mode rn
Well it’s not 😂
"lol who are you calling idiot when you think last year was 2023... We're in 24/25 season, genius.

Actual idiot.. besides Saka not actually diving against real madrid is besides the fact."
Coping for what? I'm just telling you what happened.
"Season 23/24 ended last year stupid
I Also wrote i take it all back because it was Bayern"
Ok. It's still a clear penalty. You can't hold someone that is going for the ball and pull him to the ground when he's about to make contact with the ball.
"Are you doubling down on the brainrot? Learn some reading comprehension...

THIS IS CALLED 24/25 season. ""Season 23/24"" ended last year? Uh yeah, and Arsenal did not play real madrid in the 23/24 season. It's called 24/25 SEASON because it begins in 2024 and ends in 2025.. Actual idiot. Try to think before you smash keys and call everyone stupid.

You take it all back?  
LOL

\---  


You clearly think think this is 23/24 season

And he didn't dive against bayern either. Just go away brainrotkid."
I wrote the message about taking it back after writing about him playing
"23/24 Saka went down vs Neuer 
24/25 Saka scored vs Real Madrid
I take it back that he did it against Real 
He dived vs Bayern 
Dived like a bitch 
Like Raphinha today"

Knowing us I was sure he either fucked it or was offside. Really happy he got his goal

Hope they win it
Please win it I believe in you 
Hopefully they can win this before he leaves for a bigger club
"I love this man! And I say this while believing that sacking him was the right call at the time, but I absolutely love this guy and I hope he succeeds wherever he goes. Just a great guy and manager!"
Done a job on Unai Emery.
Get ready to learn top spur buddy 
Legend. should stop exactly at 500 lol
"Such an amazing service to the club, never again be another one like you Thomas"
Favorite player ever.
The most German looking German
Absolute goat
At the end of the century he will still be listed as a Top3 German Footballer of all time.
"Very cool. 

Hoping that Vardy gets his 500th as well on the last day of the season and 2 goals to make it 200 goals."
"Truly a special case of the game, not fast, not particularly technical etc but still consistently one of the best players in the world throughout his career. A joy to witness."
"Cool story. He is a good gamer. Well deserved, for 500 more appearances at Inter Miami or something. Thomas Müller really is a player you cannot explain. He is also very funny and charismatic. Cool guy that has insion vision and winning mentality. Bayern will dearly miss him."
"That would be convenient for some, wouldn't it?"
I put my eggs into the Pavlovic basket.
Schweinsteiger will always be mine but Mueller is right there.
"Him and Pirlo to me. Not to get all old man yelling at clouds, these kind of unique players who have their own x-factor that doesn't fit into a nifty mold suitable for hyper-refined system are of a drying breed in the absolutely highest levels of football."
He's looked 45 since he was 20
I'm sure he was in The Great Escspe
Niklas Süle
Not Schweinsteiger?
I've always thought that Mario Gomez was the most German looking German
Sollte das nicht Christian Ziege sein?
"Based on career, easily. Franz and Gerd are the only ones better"
It would be funny to see him play alongside Messi. I would love to see it
For whom? You think they give up 8 points and 30 goals in 3 games without him or something?
What are you talking about?
"Tommi is beloved because of his personality, he is a cliché Bavarian without all the annoying shit, that's attached to that more often then not and he has an open outgoing personality.

If you artificially created the perfect ambassador for the club it would be him.

Pavlo comes from Munich, but he is a very different type of personality imo."
Süle looks like he should be milking cows in Kärnten
Neuer is up there
"Matthäus, Kroos, Neuer?"
"This is a wild statement.
And I'm saying this as a club member of 3 decades."
Never said that. Where'd you pull that specific set of numbers from?
Süle looks like he should be catching Kebabs from Kevin Großkreutz
For some reasons Germans never really give Kroos the recognizion. Those UCL titles are mad.
thats the numbers leverkusen would need to still catch bayern
Then who would it be convenient for? Stefan Reuter? Are you just saying things?
Kevin Großkreutz spends his summer holidays drinking buckets of Sangria with Lukas Podolski and Patrick Ebert at the Ballermann
"The reason is simple, he did it outside of Germany, so a lot of people simply forget about it, it's not even disrespect from most people.

But Kroos is absolutely amongst the legends of Germany, no doubt."
"Ah, the penny's dropped. 

Who knows? Maybe."

Yo what the hell is Modric thinking here
Luka Murder
"""Everything 50/50..."""
Ok that's pretty bad
Shocking that he went in for that
"El clasico is back.


Now we wait for Asencio red."
Another case of the result of the foul affecting the punishment when it's an insane play.
"Wow. It would be nice if I get to see the full context of the events leading up to the yellow card /s

All my homies hate ESPN+"
What else does he need to do there to get the red? Actually break Gavi's leg??
How is that not red?
Conratulations real fans (pussies) as usual ref is your 12th player
Will there be a more clear red!!
"Those have historically been yellow.  Both players feet were high, and both were going for the ball.  It's a yellow for being reckless and late, but don't try and tell me this endangered player safety when he gets right back up to yell at the ref."
How’s that not a red?
Not a red????????
Thats a red 100% geeeezus
That is a straight red
"fuck luka. class, my ass. fucking hate this guy."
i think thats a fair call both their legs were raised
That’s always a red if it were not Mr Luka Modric
'i wear White im Not getting a Red anyway'
He knows the ref is scared
Probably that tchoua tried to break olmos legs and got a yellow so anything is fair game with these 🤡
This game is unironically a total disgrace
Bro thought he was Ramos
"""I can't wait to move to Swansea in the summer"""
"I mean, yeah… that’s 99 percent of tackles. Punishment or non-punishment is completely based on the result of the play"
He needs to tap his nose
White shirt
"Yeah, everyone is a tad too desperate for a red, a booking is fine."
The studs are up lol
Uncle Dider...?
"Only works if you are the Barcelona no. 9 tho. If you are the madrid no. 9, you can try to snap a opponent's leg in half and you will only get a 1-match ban"
Except Lewandowski did that after he’d been sent off. The nose gesture was not what got him sent off
king von says end gun violence
yup refs love real madrid
"Make up call? Tchouameni should also have been sent off, so this cant be a make up call.."
Studs up isn’t like… a thing in the laws.

You don´t need VAR for this one bro..

K as in Kombat football.
The way he flies into the screen lmao
"Got the ball ref, play on!"
What was lil bro doing😭
In the ref’s defense he was not (and could not be) in position to see it properly.
Yah sorry for shitty quality
Liu Kang would def be proud of that guy's form
"Soooo bad. The VAR slow motion replays were epic. (This is from the highlights at the end of the match which didn’t show anything else, unfortunately.)"
"It's not about the quality, old FIFAs had a deliberate foul or harsh tackle button (combo?)"
"I am not sure if FIFA 2002 had it (I might have just not find it), but it let you run up to opponent's goalkeeper and tackle him for automatic red, while in ""newer"" versions you were automatically pushed away from him when getting nearby."
Ooooooh yes. Gotcha. We use to play games where you were only allowed to use the harsher slide tackle. No pokes allowed.
Used to be able to stand in front of the keeper and sometimes get a goal off a deflected punt lol

And now they’re asking you to win a game
Someone ask Ange what changed with 5th place between this season and last season
No onewould call  Chelsea or City brilliant for finishing 5th and no one called him finishing 5th last season a disaster even though they should've gotten top 4 and CL football. Him being 16th is a disaster though.
What's he referring to?
"He has possibly the worst trait a football manager could have: he yearns to be loved by the media. 

When it was early in his tenure and the results were going his way he was constantly getting clipped for saying ""straight talking"" things like ""I will never criticise a referee"" or ""I always win things in my second year"" that anyone else would realise would come back to haunt him. 

Now it's not going his way, in fact he's definitely going to get the sack and it's everyone else's fault but his. 

Hopefully he can take a break from management for a bit after this because imo he needs to rethink his priorities"
"But finishing 5th gets CL football this season, what is so difficult to grasp about that. That's the only reason behind it"
I appreciate that it's probably not nice to be under the media microscope but every video I see with him in it he's just demonstrating his victim mentality.
They'd be singing You'll never walk alone tomorrow if Arsenal were still in the title race.
"Lad just bugger off already.  You'll be happier, we'll be happier"
This guy talks so much for a dude who has taken the seventh wage bill and 5th net spend to 17th in the table while playing dire football.  Get him out jesus christ
"Wow the arrogance here is pretty incredible lol finishing 5th this year means you get champions league, it didn’t last year. That’s a key difference mate. And to say that there is some kind of hysteria with a premeditated aim or whatever, mate you’re fucking 16th in the league with Tottenham, that’s an absolute disaster no matter what you say. Ange cares a lot about what people are saying doesn’t he?"
Guy is a complete melt
5th last year wasn't champions league mate and it was a disaster because you had a horrible 2nd half of the season that has yet to be fixed the season after
"Such a melt- you didn't lose the game because a couple of fans joked about with you, I'm sure Levy wasn't telling you to lose. Blame the mentality of the club all you want- who's responsibility is it to fix it?"
I always thought that was the moment he was done with the club. He clearly looked disgusted.
He’s still going on about that? Give it a rest
"  He really lives in own pride driven fantasy world. 

How is 5th and 16th a good result. Why are you referring to last season. 

This season IS a disaster. Get out a fucking grip."
"I mean, considering he still lost that game, what's the point of this discussion. Just win once"
Watching this guy really makes me appreciate Arteta so much more than I already have.
How is this guy not sacked? They're 16th
"90% of fans living in their club’s city in Tottenham’s situation would have wanted that, anyone trying to act like Spurs fans were wrong has never experienced what a city rivalry is. Imagine being mocked for years and years for being the one handing the title to your rivals after a 20 years drought. For what? For a chance to qualify for the CL? Villa still had their fate in their hands, Spurs were behind them"
He's like a man with a fork in a world of soup.
Did someone ask him to lose 20 of them this year as well?
"Not sure what’s more surprising, Tottenham in 16th, them being only a point behind man united, or that they’re 23 points behind forest…"
"Erik ten Hag: I won 2 trophies heh

Ange Postecoglou: I finished 5th mate"
"Big difference that 5th didn't give CL football last year. 

Ange was clearly distraught by the fans reaction to that game v City. Curious to see how the Europa and that third season is gonna go."
"I saw a lot of comments about how the players were ""playing for him"" against frankfurt  only for them to lose yet another game in the league a couple of days after. I know they rallied, but the game was done at 16 mins.


In the games I've seen recently, they aren't thst gung-ho ange style, but they aren't really something else yet either. At times it looks a bit like, you know when a manager gets sacked and the interim always plays a 4231 without huge amounts of tactical detail and they win some and lose some"
Those were your own fans mate. Not the press or media. This guy is an embarrassment
this man is so cringe
Mate we're 16th. Pipe down.
"If he didn’t want to be surrounded by pathetic losers, why would he take a job at Tottenham?"
"Oh no, a manager who had unreasonable expectations from fans. Whatever can be done"
The British media made too much of his football last season. Even coining the expression Ange ball.
Fans pulling a straight pikachu face
"This guy overstayed his welcome,  no longer cute and lovable imo."
It's actually funny how spurs managers complain about essentially the same thing. Maybe it's not a manager problem 🤷
"“My team has been a disaster, and it continues to be”

Oof that’s a quote that’s going to get memed to shit."
But u/Hufftey told me he was at the game and this never happened. Ange must not have been at the game.
"Ange is a man who loves his team but hates his club. 

The media / spurs have done a good job painting him as the asshole who’s failing. We saw it with Jose and Poch and Nuno and Conte. At what point is it the club and fans and not “the self righteous Aussie”?


I truly think Ange will succeed wherever he goes next."
100%. Spurs fan base are idiots.
Is there an official rule against clubs intentionally losing matches?
Might actually be my least favourite manager ever in the PL. So unlikable. Constant victim mentality.
Being okay with your team losing so your main rival doesn't win a title is okay. Actively cheering your team to lose even tho that means you wont get cl is pathetic. Not being in the cl is the main difference between big teams and wannabees
They shoukd honestly CTRL+ALT+F4 the club. Most knackered club in Europe's top 5.
No one asked you to lose fans just didn't care get over it
How the turntables.
Much confusion!
He is talking too much for a coach that can't buy a win if his life depends on it.
Bro got too carried away
"Nah, most of the r/coys sub actually wants him to not put up a fight just so Liverpool are guaranteed to win the league. 

It's honestly pathetic"
Win? I’d take a damn draw at this point
"Injuries, being found out, and being too stubborn to adapt."
"Finishing fifth is a acceptable season for Spurs all things considered. I can't remember any Spurs fans that said that it was a disaster to finish fifth last season. Disappointing to not get CL? Sure. But not a disaster. 

Especially it being our first season post-Kane and all."
The funny bit is that a lot of it can be put down to injuries. They had no fit CBs for a good stretch of the season. Except even when Romero and VDV came back they kept losing 😂
You guys spend billions and are still shit is the difference
But Spurs are not Chelsea or City though. So a 5th for a club like Spurs is a massive achievement.
Spurs loss at some point was going to help City get the title and prevent Arsenal from winning it
Spurs fans wanted him to lose to Man City last year to deny Arsenal the title
"Arsenal would’ve been level on points with City if City lost to Spurs like they customarily do over the past few years. And Arsenal were way ahead on GD

Thry lost and Arsenal lost the league by 2 points"
Spurs were playing city who were only a point or two ahead of arsenal
https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/ange-postecoglou-tottenham-arsenal-city-32785813
"He's got an over inflated sense of self worth. He genuinely believes he's an incredible manager and faultless when it comes to where spurs are in the table.

Don't know why some people call him charming. I find him arrogant and completely unlikable."
"Ange could genuinely say anything, he could say the sky is blue and the grass is green, and you'd get some moron like this - who generally didn't watch the video nor listen to the question the journalist asked of him - using it to analyse his character like a Shakespeare play."
If every Spurs manager is like this maybe the issue isn't the manager.
I don't mean to sound nasty but he's aged so much since he took the Spurs job
Speak for yourself
This guy talks so much in the press conferences he is required to do where people ask him loads of questions. Come on man grow up.
"Around 25% of his entire points tally at spurs up until now have come in the first 10 games. 

So yeah it’s not just the 2nd half but a couple of months before that."
Premeditated hysteria my ass. Just shite and have been for a year and a half now
He had been shite for several months before that game happened.
They’re about to be in the Europa final why would they sack him before the season ends?
"Jesus Christ, thank you. The most sensible take on that whole situation I’ve ever heard on here. 

I think most of the criticism for “that” mentality came from Americans or international football fans who don’t understand what rivalry truly means to the people that LIVE in the city. 

Handing Arsenal the title (from a fan perspective), would have been painful, and something we’d never have lived down. What would I rather? Deal with Arsenal fans moaning about “loser mentality” because we didn’t want them to win the league, or Arsenal fans laughing in jubilation at us HANDING them the title. I know what I’d rather.

Interestingly, I remember the year Spurs were in the CL final and Arsenal were in the EL final against Chelsea. Arsenal fans were asked whether they would rather lose the EL final if it meant Spurs lost the CL final and over 90% said yes because they could handle seeing Spurs win a CL before them. And I don’t blame them at all. It’s normal."
"Can't say those logical things here on /r/goonerscirclejerk

Also, people seem to forget that when that situation occurred, we were well aware that there were 2 outcomes:

Arsenal win the title, and we join the CL that we would never win.

Or

Deny Arsenal of the title and be a part of EL and have a better chance of winning.

And here we are in the semi finals."
"Sure, but losing that game ended any hope they had for CL. At that point, winning the game still had them in with a chance"
"Weird behaviour but I’ll bite, he’s obviously talking in a general sentiment here from the fans before and after the game. Clearly not literally asked to lose a game of football. If he was he hasn’t said as much. 

Also you’ve completely ignored what my comment on the other post was actually about, had literally nothing to say to what I asked you because you knew you’d look stupid and then tagged me in a comment on a completely different post a few days later like a weirdo. I was talking about the atmosphere at the game amongst the home fans. 

Stay watching the games in your basement in Canada kid. Leave the actual opinions about what happens at games to people that are at the games."
Yup. In the mls.
Most football fans are idiots*
"If it's found you're doing it deliberately, it would be match fixing. Spurs have enough plausible deniability to get away with it however."
Absolutely insane to suggest that Spurs fans didn't care about the result of that game last season
*insert GIF*
Nowhere in [the comments on this post on r/coys](https://old.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1k87q5t/this_time_last_year_i_was_asked_to_lose_a_game/) do I see any sentiment like that. Why lie about (supposedly) your own fanbase?
"Complete lie, they’ve already won the league. We want to stop fucking losing games"
Simply not true
"Seriously? That's... 

Well, it's something, for sure."
The user most certainly means that this year you‘ll get a CL spot and not a EL spot.
"Definitely. I'm just sure Spurs fans were hoping for after the brilliat start, same way Chelsea fans were hopig for a lot more before Christmas"
5th one season after Kane was an accomplishment.
I thought we were better posed to go far in Europa league than champions league. Was thinking we’d build on last season though instead of implode.
Getting CL last year could have given you more spending options to avoid being shit this season
"Nowhere in their comment did they say we weren’t shit. You’re just insecure, cause tottenham are in fact shit."
U act like Tottenham don’t have money
"Chelsea are a big team is the difference. ""The big 6"" will no longer be a thing in a couple of years. Enjoy your new normal."
"I agree, but he's not talking about clubs, hes talking about the 5th place, ignoring the fact that 5th is CL football this season and it wasn't last season."
Bear in mind for that match they were also in mix for CL….
"It wasn't just them losing and saying ""oh well at least it hurts our rivals"". They were actively celebrating in the stands when City scored."
They were legitimately cheering in the stands when city scored lmao
Which was the right thing to do
">> Widened their gap on city 

That imply Arsenal were ahead of City which wasn’t true. City kept 2 points lead pretty much until the end despite Arsenal winning 14 of their last 15 games."
">Arsenal would’ve been level on points with City if City lost to Spurs

No, the gap was 2 points. Even a draw would have seen Arsenal leapfrog City."
"He talks extremely well and has a lot of charisma. But he does seem extremely stubborn and doesn't seem to take a lot of responsibility. But that's in the media, not sure how he is privately.

I think people constantly talking negatively about you does trigger a defense mechanism where you don't even want to give them an inch. It happened to ten Hag as well. Started out as open and honest and when things started to turn sour he'd throw every mental gymnastic in the ring just to not admit any of the criticism might be right."
"It probably hasn't helped that people act like his accomplishments are on par with that of most CL clubs' managers. I literally got into arguments (which is my fault) with spurs fans after he was appointed that he was on the level of when Liverpool appointed Klopp. The man has had success in Australia and Scotland, and plenty of people who aren't even PL level managers, let alone big club level managers, have done that."
"I really turned against him when they played us (Everton), we equalised late on and Ange did the whole post match interview mumbling while staring at his shoes. It was embarrassingly childish."
spuds signed a manager built for the championship and are surprised with the results. just small club things
"No I'm sorry, you're chatting shit. He's saying the media ""hysteria"" around spurs finishing with their lowest ever points total of the premier league era is ""premeditated towards a certain outcome"", i.e. him getting the sack. He then cites them coming 5th last season as an achievement - which it was not given they were chasing CL football. 

Now if I read that as just one quote in the history of him having perhaps the worst persecution complex of any manager this season, I don't think that's unfair.  And I don't think *you're* a moron for disagreeing with me, I think you like Ange because he did a good job at Celtic - fair enough. But the fault for Ange, is not in his stars, the referee, the media, it's in himself."
"bro i remember when Liverpool Fans saying he defended VAR (when they made they horrible call against Liverpool), when Ange was actually shitting on them. 

People don't care what this people say, they just care about their public perception. 


Ange saying ""yeah this game is on me""

Will not be posted on the hot page here, while some out of context headline obviously does."
Haven't we all? By nearly two years even.
He has definitely lost weight. Not sure if that is from dieting or the stress of being at spurs.
"Hes incredibly defensive - just say i havent done a good enough job this yr but we sre gomna keep
Fighting like a professional"
That's not what they mean and you know it. He's such a whiner and finger pointer.
Absolutely insane stat.
"You're right, the final is too far away to sack him just yet"
They should’ve sacked him 4 months ago
They're not about to be in the Europa League final there is still another team in the way. Fuck every club not in a top five league though might as well not exist.
Bodø Glimt may have something to say about that.
I mean it happened to Jose Mourinho before the carabou cup final
"So afraid of banter that you'd rather throw a game. That's sad. Even if it's what you'd prefer, it is absurd to expect a manager and players to do that, and it would completely destroy the integrity of the game.

I think it's very clear what the rivalry means to those of you who live in the city : way too damn much.

It's beyond what is healthy."
"Do people not remember what happened at the end of last season? We would’ve qualified for ucl IF we got any results from the previous 4 matches. Nobody wanted us to throw away UCL qualification, we had been shit for months and Arsenal not winning the league was a very small consolation prize."
"Even if they qualified for the Champions League, it’s not a trophy. Is being mocked for years and years by your rivals worth qualifying to a tournament you have no chances to win? 

It’s easy to say when you live far from your club’s city but when you live and breathe the club, it’s a totally different story"
lol very insecure behavior to go through my profile to find something to diminish my argument. I used to live in London as a toddler and moved to Canada for better dental care lol.
No they're not
Did you watch the game they cheered Citys goal hahaha
"The top comment when sorted by best on the link you provided:

“Mate pls just win EL fuck the league lose as many as you want just win a fucking trophy it’s been so long.”


So yeah about that…"
Only most of the daily threads I've read in the past week and a few posts that had nothing to do with it whatsoever
"I take it he's going to rotate heavily tomorrow either way, which is probably the right thing to do."
Let’s agree on a draw then?
"Nah that's a load of bollocks. Haven't seen anybody say that, and what would be the point, Liverpool have essentially already won the league.

That person is just lying for karma from fans of other teams"
"Looking at how much Spurs/Levy are willing to spend soberly, finishing anywhere between 4th and 6th in the league is a acceptable/okay season. 7th some seasons depending on how cup European places are dallied out. And that's without factoring in things like cup runs and if we are in Europe as well. Finishing anywhere above 4th is a really good league campaign.

Levy is never going to splurge enough for Spurs to be a regular top 3 team just on money alone. He invests what he is willing to invest and expects the manager to improve the players enough to get beyond that. 

And Ange is clearly failing at that once we remove those first ten games."
"With the money spent and no European games, it was decent."
Same. Given how much Levy is willing to spend the EL just suits us better imo.
Thank you lol. Feel like i'm reading some bizzaro comment. They wouldn't be 16th if they got UCL last season  in the first place.
I am a Barca fan lmao
I was criticizing Chelsea. City have made proper use of those billions and actually make good signings.
"The only reason Spurs were ever involved in the ‘big 6’ discussion was because they had Kane and the media couldn’t handle the England captain playing for a mid table team. 

Now that he’s gone Spurs will revert to their usual position which is mid table and the occasional relegation battle. That’s their place."
Such an unserious club
That match had zero bearing on them finishing 4th.
"I see this a lot and maybe some fans were, but I was at the game and no one in my section cheered when we conceded, and I didn't see anybody in the stadium celebrating. It was the usual groan and then some people joking about it. The atmosphere in the ground was muted generally, a little more than you'd expect. But I'm confident in saying that me and everybody around me wanted us to win that game, at least outwardly.

Maybe there's some video I haven't seen but as far as I can see the narrative is mostly just based on random ""Spurs fan"" social media accounts, not the ground"
This is just not true. It's mad that people think this is true.
There was Spurs fan who genuinely went to the match in Spurs light blue away jerseys to show support for Man City.
I wonder if it will be the same this time because it will likely be the last season they have an influence on Ange.
"You’re right I’ll edit. 

Main point being Arsenal would’ve won the league if Spurs beat city still stands though"
"What a run they want on just to lose by 2 points. That’s crazy, I guess the voodoo is over for city"
thanks for this. needed a laugh today
"Again, they’re about to be in the Europa final. No they shouldn’t have lol"
Just like they were about to be in the Europa League quarter-finals back in 2020/21 before Dinamo Zagreb's big comeback.
"And if they do, then you sack him"
"And they lost, why would they do it again?"
"Who said I “expect” the players and manager to throw the game? No one “expects” that. Managers and footballers don’t have loyalty to clubs like fans so they’d never do that. 

If you’re asking what I’d prefer.. I’ve already explained that. 

To the same extent, I could quite easily say “to obsess over one game is unhealthy”."
"> Even if they qualified for the Champions League, it’s not a trophy.

Wenger: _what did u say u lil bitch?_"
They'll be mocked for years for actively wanting their team to lose as well. As well as many other things.
"Yeah mate, because they cared about the result"
A tale as old as time: selling out your club or fellow fans on /r/soccer for useless upvotes
"Tbf that's not out of wanting to lose games that's just desperation for a fucking trophy, since our season's long long gone and relegation's out of the equation makes sense for fans to just care about Europa.

Would still like a win here and there in the league of course but beggars can't be choosers"
You're genuinely just wrong. My last comment saying about how we should want to win the game is on -15 points and people saying 'Literally any team would do the same if it was their biggest rivals.'
"I don't agree with your last comment in particular. Bergvall in 6 months looks completely different and that's just this year, MaddiSon leads better this year and seems to understand his role. The team (especially midfield) has issues and the defense this year along with very audacious ""investments"" from Levy, yet so much is on Ange even when players have made the mistakes. Also your top paragraph sounds like the 2010's but that's what got us in this and not the historical norm for Tottenham.

4th is fantastic as a Spurs fan, it doesn't happen a lot, don't be daft."
"https://www.transfermarkt.com/premier-league/einnahmenausgaben/wettbewerb/GB1/plus/0?ids=a&sa=&saison_id=2020&saison_id_bis=2024&nat=&pos=&altersklasse=&w_s=&leihe=&intern=0

It's not just about spending. We were worse than you when Arteta took over and since then we have spent less money than you but still improved massively while you have regressed"
I’d rather us strive for more. But currently at best we’re a Europa league team unfortunately
"Oh, then shut the fuck up.


We know we’re shit, don’t need some holier than though barcelona cunt chiming in."
That Son miss is a traumatic moment
Happens when your priority is wanting Arsenal to lose over wanting your club to do well.
Well no actually it was the biggest reason they didn't finish 4th. They ended up 2 points behind Villa. If they'd won it they'd have been in the UCL this year instead.
"You’re rewriting history here. It would be one thing if it was “look at the bright side at least if we lose Arsenal won’t win” 

It was people ACTIVELY cheering for us to lose. That was some foul, lame ass, rotten shit. Ange was right to criticize it, especially any semblance of that happening within the club."
You had fans in your stadium doing the poznan while losing. Bit different from just seeing the positives from a bad situation.
"As if spurs fans weren’t doing the pozman in the stands when Man City scored.

You can’t frame it as “oh well, at least Arsenal won’t win” when weak ass spurs fans were on here and elsewhere on the internet begging for that loss."
I'm pretty sure there's a video of Spurs fans doing the poznan after city scored but maybe you're right. It could just be social media idiots and a few made it into the stadium.
There were people doing the poznan after City scored lmao
Would have won it with the draw with that Son chance too.
"Bodo/Glimt: 'well fuck us, right?'"
Yes but they're 16th mate
"Well atleast they learn the lesson.

(it will be funny if they do it again though)"
Does Levy learn from his mistakes?
"Bro you are Australian, you can’t understand"
"No one wants to lose so that Liverpool wins the league. People just don’t care about league results one way or the other. 

If we win, great. If we lose, eh whatever.  Just make sure our best team is healthy and in form for Europa."
Only if you completely ignore wages
We’ve had to replace deadwoood that’s been around since 2018.
I too want us to strive for more. I just don't see Levy doing that. He only seems willing to invest enough for fighting for Europe and expects the manager to push the players beyond that.
They spent loads too post 2015 on flop transfers but will pretend they didn't
Arsenal not winning a title is a big deal and if you played a hand in it well worth it. A random valiant victory means nothing as the team isn’t consistently doing it. I agree they should have lost against city so arsenal don’t win the title.
"Saying that Tottenham losing to the reigning champions was the reason they didn't qualify for the champions league, opposed to the fact that they had only won 3 out of their last 10 PL games is certainly an opinion."
"You're not a true hater, you wouldn't understand"
That’s 3 drunk fans lmao.
"The disrespect for a side that has been pretty consistently springing upsets in recent years is crazy. Spurs putting up an absolute stinker in Norway is a massive possibility, and maybe even to be expected the way they've been performing"
And if they win Europa they make champions league… so it doesn’t matter where they finish at that point.
"Bro you are Italian, you can't understand"
Before we got CL football we had similar wages as spurs from the numbers I could find
You make it sound like we didn't have loads of deadwood as well. Difference is that since Arteta came in we have had very few costly flops
Unlike Chelsea we don't get bailed out by our billionaire owners. Prem teams are like entitled children
"You're the one who said it had ""zero bearing"" though lol. Which isn't true. It did have a bearing. It wasn't the main reason. But it was a reason."
Did you not watch the match? They were very close to getting a point
You forgot the population makeup you’re attempting to be reasonable with.
"What do you mean you were never getting champions league football? Villa finished 2 points ahead of you and lost their final game of that season to Palace. If you had won that game, you could at least put more pressure on Villa to need to win that game.


Don't start rewriting history now."
"I don't think that was the sentiment i saw from a majority of the Spurs fans. It's one thing making best of a loss, the sentiment was that they wanted to lose and were happy to do so. Not something any coach or a serious player would ever want to see."
All clubs have shit parts of their fans and that did occur.
"Lmaoo, it's mad how you call out arsenal fans for crying when it seems like you're the one rattled mate"
You look emotional mate
Tottenham winning a trophy? Let’s be realistic here he should’ve been gone considering there was a genuine possibility of relegation at one point
But they are 16th
"I understand it cause I live in my football’s club area. Here in Europe, city rivalries affect your life, cities completely stop when a team wins a big trophy. It’s a constant back and forth between football rivals cause you live with them, like we’re still bitching about a domestic cup we won 12 years ago just cause the final was against our rivals"
Exactly lol the Arsenal starting line up today has only 3/4 starters from 2021. People acting like Arteta inherited this squad
You're not wrong but barca is only using their academy again because they have no choice otherwise they were just buying players for more than twice their actual worth
"Like a raindrop is responsible for a tsunami

Logic being: 'here we go teaam that has about 20 points from your last 20 games, go on an beat the champions, and if you dont do it; that is it exact reason you didnt qualify for the champions league. Ignore being pumped 3 - 0 by Fulham at home, it was definitely failing to beat Man City that meant Spurs didn't get CL football*"
"Thars the point. 

The point being that a point wouldn't have been enough"
"Not just that, Villa lost that game 5-0. Palace ended the season in unbelievable form and there's a good chance Villa would've crumbled under the pressure of UCL football and lost anyways"
"Villa was ahead the whole time and only laid down in the last match because they had CL sewn up already. They would have actually tried against Palace if they didn't clinch with Tottenham's loss vs City. 

Palace was absolutely scorching at the time tbf so it is debatable that Villa would have been able to pick up the required points if they had been trying."
Im not saying they’re 100% gonna win. But they’re favorites going into a semi final. He should be sacked over the summer but not with a Europa final on the line.
Would it be better to finish 5th and not play CL or 16th and win Europa? If they win Europa who gives a shit where they finish. They got the same thing as top 5 clubs (besides Liverpool) and a trophy.
We've spent a lot after a huge money influx. Chelsea constantly are pulling money out of their ass. I am not saying are management was competent but lets not compare clubs owned by billionaires vs their members. Your billionaires are a safety net which we don't have so our struggles are not the same
">they’re about to be in the Europa final

>Im not saying they’re 100% gonna win.

Hmmm"
"5th gets CL this year but you're right. If it were the league cup, no way - but a European Final would be huge. Doesn't buy back enough favor to give Ange another year managing us, but it would make this season successful even with the atrocious league form."
I'm just messing with you. Winning Europa League would be huge for them.
Fair enough I guess
Arsenal and PSG are about to be in the CL final. So is Barcelona and Inter.
"Damn, Porto will end 4th :skull:"
"I doubt it.

Benfica, even if out of the title race, will beat Braga in the last game"
Nice jinx man
"I wouldn't, I don't expect us to beat the final 3 matches. Yesterday we lost against one of the weakest sides in the league, and deservedly so. Every match has been tough for us so I can't expect Porto to win matches against weaker sides like I did in the past. Braga is the number 1 contender to finish third even if they face Benfica on the way."
"Dude, say anulo mufa RIGHT NOW"
"Shut up, George."
I won't. I said that even if we are out of the title race we will still beat Braga.
"Carlo joining the Seleção and still not giving Endrick minutes would be funny.

Tragic, but funny."
Striking the iron when it's molten at this point
"Yeeesh, didn't waste a second, did you?"
"carlo quedete   
carlo quedete"
Goodluck to him. Hopefully he does well there.
Ancelotti in the Brazil dugout. Absolute cinema
"Ironically, I still think Ancelotti is basically the ideal Real Madrid coach."
Scaloni will finish what Flick started.
"he will select Endrick for the world cup tho 

  
As a super sub"
"Sending that ""He did it again, huh? I wouldn't treat you like that"" text"
I do too but there will be a lot of people who don’t agree.
"He'll play an amazing 5 min, every third game."

"A Young Boys equaliser in the 125th minute was correctly chalked off by VAR due to a handball

Never in the 100 years history of the Swiss Cup had a 3rd division team qualified for the final

This will be Biel-Bienne's second cup final after 1961 under player-manager Jupp Derwall, when they lost 0-1 to La Chaux-de-Fonds

The final will be played on June 1 in Bern, where Biel-Bienne will either meet Basel or Lausanne."
moments like this are what this sport is truly all about.
Never seen an entire stadium celebrating so much after beating some Young Boys.
Worst thing to happen to Young Boys since priests
Schweizer Bielefeld
Amazing feat.
"We were incredibly shit but today‘s refereeing was an absolute scandal and needs to be adressed. The red card was very questionable and the penalty was a clear dive, no idea how VAR did not intervene at all. Again, not an excuse for us being absolute dogshit and people who haven’t seen the match will probably think I’m just coping but this is unacceptable"
That's a shitton of people for a third division team. Seriously impressive and great to see.
Hope they win it! Like FC Wil did as a lower division team 2004
Amazing scene there.....
"Well done FC Biel-Bienne! Way to commit, strive and be humble in your Team's endeavours!"
"> player-manager Jupp Derwall

holy shit, that's some interesting bit of trivia"
Doesn’t this guarantee them a spot in European qualification if Basel win the other semi final? Winner of cup qualifies for Europe and as Basel already have through the league doesn’t it go to runner up if Basel were to win cup as well. If Lausanne get to cup final then it’s winners gets a European spot
literally BIELefeld
I don't see a problem with the red card decision (especially after the referee's explanation after the game). The penalty though is at least questionable. Unfortunately you can't see it clearly because at the best camera angle there's a leg in the way at the moment of (supposed) impact. I still think it's not a penalty and this kind of histrionic dive (just learned a new English word there) shouldn't be rewarded anyway..
"That's the result of a completely fucked up season, my friend. :) Banter aside, ref Dudic & team better not visit Berne in the next two weeks. What a absolute shitshow. I don't dare to imagine if this ""refusal of work"" happens today in Basel... Switzerland has an outstanding referee-problem, it needs a special kind of talent to be so shit. Imterestingly he was quite ok at his last game (FCB-Yverdon). 


You would have turned that game around easily, almost did. Dudic didn't let you."
hardly coping not seeing the pulling and leg contact of Imeri. Since the contact was outside penalty area its freekick and red card. funny you dont adress the penalty that was given which indeed was questionable instead...... typical bernese
"The stadium was built when they played in second tier, with top flight football in mind (it would be possible to add capacity). But sadly, the club went bankrupt just after the stadium opened and got relegated to fifth tier. Slowly climbed their way back up and are now looking to come back to second tier. Biel also has a top flight ice hockey team that plays right next to it with 5500-6000 visitors per game, a good part of them usually shows up for important football games."
"congrats, you‘re on a list now"
Wil was in Switzerland's top tier when they won the Swiss Cup in 2004 (but they were relegated at the end of the season). Sion was and is the only lower division team in Swiss Cup history to win the whole thing back in 2006.
"now only if you win the cup, you get a EL qualification spot. 

it changed in all europe a few years ago ( around when UEFA cup changed name to Europa League). At least in Portugal is like that too"
"I did adress that penalty, what are you even saying? And for the red card situation, the ref/var confirmed holding was not enough for a penalty and even the contact is - for me - absolutely minimal with the Biel player (understandably) making the absolute most of it. Questionable, but not a clear refereeing error like the penalty that lead to the goal. So i did mention both and at the same time acknowledged we were dogshit and should never even be in the situation where we have to be discussing refs in the first place, i dont know why you still felt the need to be a douchebag."
"Forgot it, Sion also won it vs YB who then blew a 2:0 lead even and hadnt won a trophy since decades. Wil was vs GC in the final."
If the winner of the cup already qualified for Europe through the league does the spot drop down to another position in the league. I guess that’s what happens in the top 5 leagues as you can see 7 teams qualify for Europe from the premier league some years
yes. it goes to a league place
"Wtf ,this is the most Hostile Clasico in like 15 years"
"How does one pay for such an expensive ticket and decide to do such stupidity, lmao"
Games not gone
wtf is it always this agressive
All this happening and it's still 7 hours till kickoff 💀
come on man dont do this shit its just a game
Calm down bruh
Game's el back
"Games gone, u can’t even break ur opponents nose anymore"
We might be expecting a big fight during the game
Game’s back
Damn the event’s around this El clasico are crazy man😭. Lets hope that his fire will transfer to the players
Really hope the match delivers like the drama and not be like the last two matches 
One match ban
It's a game....i hate fans who do violence over a fucking sport
Nah Gavi what are you doing
"Ashamed of some Barca fans justifying this in the comments. One even complained about being assaulted in a past post yet celebrates this. 

Proud of the fans who call it out. Hope we win the game clean & there’s no problems with either set of fans."
I expected more than the “most humble fan base in the world”
Dat ain’t rite
Fucking English at it again
Football’s back
Classic elclasico is back
Why can't Spanish fans act normal for more than 3 Seconds its incredible
"C'mon Spanish police, stop being soft"
Why have some sports regressed?
Is the Barcelona fan okay?
"Madrid should refuse to play, how about that?"
"What the hell why?

Even our coach was saying this is just sports and a game, we should protect everyone. I hope he stays in there for a long time"
"These savages will never learn, busting other people's noses, instead of handling it elegantly, like pushing them into a fountain"
Vile fanbase
"I've seen enough, penalty to Real Madrid! /s"
this match is gonna have an insane atmosphere
"Prolly the Boixos Nois, these are the reason they have been banned from the camp nou and people want them unbanned😂"
Crazy to think that Barca fan is refereeing the game later
People like this are the actual scum of the earth. Takes a particular amount of oxygen deprivation to attack someone over a game.
HOLY SHIT THE PRIME IS BACK
"Common Barca fan

But ig they are the most humble club right... ?"
Games not gone yet
"Game\`s back, nose is gone"
Go on again son
most emotionally mature varcalona fan
Good that he was arrested if he started it
Popped nose ahead of a cup final? Game’s BACK
Prolly some tourist
Games Back!
"This Classico has been nuts till now, if the game doesn't deliver I'm going to be so disappointed.

( I already am looking forward to being disappointed by the result. Yes I am a Madrid fan, why'd you ask ? )"
"Did him a favour, our football stinks"
Saw the post about a train of madrid fans and a train of barca fans coming into seville together and i just couldnt think of a way that turns out anything other than bad.
I really hope it's not just 1 stupid fan so far. Something that might trigger it is are controversial Referee calls in the game or a humiliating defeat. Security must be very high tonight. Thank god both teams have the most relaxed coaches.
Ehh a broken nose is definitely not something uncommon in a clasico lol
And Ramos isn’t even involved
No it ain't let's be fair. Apart from this and madrid crying nothing else has happened
"> such stupidity

Answer's *riiight* there, bud."
4L Beer will do that.
"It's possible that there is Barcelona fans living in Sevilla btw that are not going to the game, but are just there for gathering.

Have you never went out to watch a football game? I assume the atmosphere on the sport bars before, during and after is fantastic. Not just in the bars, but also in the street.

  
But who nose"
"He lost his nose though

We won, but at what cost? 😞"
"Not since the mou days. I hope the game delivers like the buildup has (not that this is a good thing, but the other stuff)."
for a while it hasnt been
"It hasn't been like this in a looooong time lol, I figured it'd become hostile if both teams were equal but Barcelona is clear of us this season

Fingers crossed this is the only bad thing that happens today"
I’m so glad it’s aggressive again. Game is back
Yank spotted
Nose? No. Legs? Ask Mbappe
"I was expecting real to play dirty tonight, now I’m sure they will, soooo much animosity in the air.."
I see assault is considered as game's back now. Makes you think about what's next.
Without injuries of course 🙏
"Ah, yes. The most unique fanbase consisting of a single soul


Btw, why would anyone think of Barca as humble?"
Yes because of one person… you sound like an idiot with no due respect
Would you be saying that if someone broke your nose tho? I realllyyyy doubt it
Heard he broke his nose
hope the rm fan get well soon tho
"I don't think it's that common, actually, hence why this is news. Let's not fall into ""this massive group of people is represented by its five drunkest idiots"" rhetoric"
So you're condemning an entire fanbase and club for one idiot. Lol
You love people being assaulted and getting their noses broken on the streets?
Very little will happen
4 litres of sangria in a carton
"It helps with that but u already have to be a degen in the first place which these ""ultras"" type of people definitely are. Also idk how it is in Spain but drug use is very common among these people as well where I am from."
Have you ever been to an away game for Barça? Then you'd now that there's where the Boixos still have their people in.
Nose is gone
Incoming 0-0 snooze fest.
fun fact im from iraq and during those classicos knight fights would breakout all over the country in cafes and bars. legit remember a year when 2 died and 7 got hospitalized. things like that don’t happen anymore because the game is less intense than those days
It won't (well depending on who you support) madrid will not put up a fight.
wym the last time this kinda stuff happened was in like the mourinho pep times
"Downvoted for telling the truth.

Make it make sense r/soccer"
Arch nemesis playing rough against each other? Wild concept
It's a joke mate
*Mbappe practicing his stomps*
"This ain't the Balkans, the world is watching"
Voldemort origin story?
Bono my nose is gone.
Not with madrid's defence
City's not playing
OG will intervene
"Hmmm, Madrid is in a really tough period, that’s why I’m saying they might be extra dirty. Ofc I know they ain’t cuddling tonight whatever the context"
"Yeah the Spanish aren’t especially aggressive or violent in my (admittedly limited) experience living in Spain. 

I think they got it all out of their system by the 1900’s."
"5-4-1 Barca pelting shot after shot with a Courtois masterclass as per usual to score only one goal, one ball over the top for Mbappe and 1-1. Same thing in ET into penalties. Lowkey curious if Madrid is willing to play like this because they’ve set up super defensively against City before Mbappe joined"
I think there was still some left for the 1900’s
Lol yeah but they were REALLY killing it (no pun intended) from like 1450-1880. Im talking ‘creating the transatlantic slave trade’ levels of violence and aggression.
Exporting got harder but luckily there was still a strong home market
Aksthually the Portuguese created the transatlantic slave trade.
Global empire completely crumbled and your past rivals are now leagues above you? Missing out on your yearly suggested dose of violence and mass atrocities? We have just the fix: Fascism!

Someone post the Szczesny celebration where he looks like he's playing an accordion
"Meet in the Champions League final. Szczęsny starts. Intentionally drops a disasterclass so we can win it. 

Arsène Wenger, he's done it again."
"Not wrong there for most of the past 20 years, Henry doesn't know the damage he's done to a generation"
True Gooner.
Love this tall ass chainsmoker
Szczęsny perfectly captures the emotional rollercoaster of being an Arsenal fan. Loyalty mixed with cautious hope  you can’t blame him for feeling that way.
"People in here gatekeeping being sad, apparently you can only talk about suffering if you live in a 3rd world country on the verge of starvation, supporting the lowest tier team in that country that's bankrupt."
"thought we only had the celebration police, now we have the suffering police in the comments 😭"
Brother you still got #OneLastJob if we meet 🙏🙏
Which team is he supporting this season in UCL then? PSG? Inter? 
not really about szczesny but PL fans are so fucking spoiled lol
All I did was bought him a Teasmaid for Christmas
"Arsenal are my favorite prem team after traveling to London when I was 7-8 and as soon as I turned on the TV in the hotel I saw Thierry Henry absolutely torch Blackburn. 

They truly have become the prom night special of clubs - just when you expect to finally get some, all you get is just the tip. Losing the CL final to Barcelona, not taking the prem when Leceister won it and these past few years they've been playing some beautiful footy, but it just hasn't been enough to get past City or Liverpool. I think they've got the best cb duo on the planet (when healthy) and their midfield is incredible, Rice, Odegaard and even Partey are a treat to watch. Arteta is a great coach and whether or not they sign Nico/a striker I think their time is coming and it will be that much sweeter when they win the league or the CL."
Arsenal fans love to go on about how they suffer while a fan of any other club in the country bar about 4 would kill for their success
It always is
*is visibly confused*
He’s just like me
Being an Arsenal fan is piss easy compared to 99.99% of clubs. 
Nobody wants to see Arsenal win CL.
Had me in the first half ngl
"Antonio Conte to Arsenal, who says no?"
Not much of a fan if he doesn’t want Arsenal to won it. Plenty of players admit they want their favourite team to win even if it means beating the team they currently play for.
God gives his biggest struggles to the 2nd place team! Gooners should be a protected class as they are clearly a marginalized group in society!
"He should wish to win CL with his team, and not hope Arsenal don't win it."
“Suffering” Christ alive.

Petr Cech Europa Final 2.0
"Ahh yes the cech special in baku, dropped a stinker in the final against the club where he had a job already lined up."
This would be pretty poetic considering how many times he's fucked Arsenal out of the Champions League by getting himself sent off.
Remind me to come back to this after psg sends u back
"My gooner cousin once said ""you don't know how hard it is to be an Arsenal fan"" to me, when at the time, Arsenal were the FA Cup holders.

Honestly fans of big teams have no perspective on the game."
Imagine the trauma he inflicted on other teams.
Henry getting credit over Wenger is insane to me
I specifically started supporting Arsenal because of him and he was gone within half a year 😂😂
"Ridiculous you don't know a thing about suffering. One of the richest most favoured teams in England by media, refs,the EFL. They changed the fa cup just because clubs like you were complaining 

You haven't had six fucking years in league one or 4 playoff finals without a single goal. You are a cushy existence with millions of plastics and glory hunters depriving teams that could do with the revenue from locals going to them"
GUYS did you know that he SMOKES CIGARETTES?
"Hardly,it's just not suffering is it and it's nothing compared to others"
"Nah it's like some millionaire who's stocks dropped by 10% talking about 'constant suffering', telling actual poor people 'iT'S aLL rELaTiVe'"
Obviously Inter.
"Oh the suspense 

I don't know if I can anymore"
Obviously bigger clubs have higher standards but it's hard to sympathise when their banter era incudes qualifying for Europe and winning trophies (albeit not league titles).
"He's obviously just joking.

I don't think any Premier League club could really compare their struggles with someone like... I don't know, Wimbledon or Bolton Wanderers or Dagenham & Redbridge, or something.

If us not winning a Premier League title for 20 years, while still playing in the Champions League, watching some of the best players of that generation of football play for your team and still win trophies along the way is ""suffering"", then I'll take that over having to constantly refresh BBC Sport to see if my team has gone into administration or is dissolved."
It's all relative but I think a spurs supporter would know more about suffering than anyone in the league
"Billions of ppl on this planet ""would kill"" to live the life of someone at the low end of the socioeconomic scale in England.

Suffering is just an emotion and it's obviously relative to what you experienced before and what you expect from a team."
"It is all relative and you know that...

I support less successful teams in other sports (or people in individual sports) and it is a different set of expectations."
"These things are relative, you know that"
"To be fair, we got a European trophy before they did and we made it about as far as they have in recent years in Europa League. The feeling of making it this far in the top European competition when you haven't been there in 20 years must be pretty nice."
"4? Arsenal are basically the English Dortmund

Edit: nevermind, i misread that as four in the world."
I assume Arsenal fans would.
"I don't know, I wouldn't mind it myself."
Villa fans might want them to get to the final at least
"More specifically, Chelsea don't want to see Arsenal win CL because of the very vocal subsection of their online fanbase that respond to any comment about Chelsea's current failings with 'yeah but where's your UCL?'."
Same. I don’t want to see the og cheat club win another again.
"Out of all your clubs examples of shite managers, you actually suggest one of the better ones here IMO lol"
How have you not been able to understand that is literally the same thing?
"Looks more like he's making love to a bear, somehow..."
"Against Barcelona, funny enough"
Cheers Geoff!
WENGER... IN...?
"Dude don't jinx it, I've seen enough disasterclasses by him to know it's completely plausible, he's at four reds already and each more stupid than the last"
What's doing a Lehmann? Possession of cp material or attacking your neighbor with an axe?
Instantly came to mind.
Except for the part where it leads to you 'winning it' I guess.
He's not downplaying psg. It's a joke
"Maybe someone could remind you what a joke is, you fucking melt"
"It's always hilarious seeing the ""big 6"" fans complaining about their woes.

There was a period of time before broadband was readily available that I could only keep up with Leeds in league 1 through fucking teletext."
all relative though. could say Wednesday fans have never suffered because they've never been relegated out of the football league like some clubs. you don't know how good you have it! etc. etc.
"Exactly.

Do you remember Arsenal's relegations?

Or when they nearly went out of business?

Having to repeatedly sell their best players and never having a sniff at European football never mind a trophy?

Poor poor Arsenal, constant suffering my arse."
"I get what you're saying, I probably said the same, but the truth is the perspective comes from your team's results vs expectations, the expectations for arsenal and a bottom half team aren't going to be the same which is why we probably both end up miserable"
"I never get that poetic at all, to be honest. They choose, without anyone asking them to, one of the most successful clubs in the whole world at the moment (be it Barca, Madrid, Manchester, Arsenal, Milan whatever - even in relative ""crisis"", that's obviously the 0,0001% top of the world lol). And then they act like they're carrying some cross. It's completely free, at any time starting and stopping is completely inconsequential. And also, it's completely unrelated to your life, nothing actually happens to you whether some team far away wins a game or not. And nobody in the world gets anything from you being a devoted fan of a gigantic global brand, even one cent or some cultural change, there's completely no effect, like it's literally just something you choose to do for fun and nothing else. I struggle taking it even remotely seriously.

Fans of a local amateur 5th tier club that's just their family's club, closest to their place of living, things like that - yeah, I can KINDA get acting like they're doing something.

But someone just decided to follow Arsenal and now I'm supposed to be impressed with their amazing sacrifice because the team is not the champion of England... yeah, I don't get why."
Neville is still recovering
"It's understandable, as a kid you fall in love with a player, not a manager

Henry made an entire generation love Arsenal"
"You're not wrong but it makes sense, it's players that kids fall in love with. Of course Wenger built the team and brought them Henry specifically but kids grow up idolizing the players, and Henry was the biggest for Arsenal."
"What he means that, fans growing up looked up to Henry, a player"
Yeah because Henry was far more famous and made a whole generation of arsenal fans
"Henry is the reason I'm an arsenal fan, I remember him scoring an insane flick up goal vs west ham as a kid and that was that."
"Ikr, even though Arsene Wenger founded the club!"
"Favoured by refs is a funny one, God I wish I could have some of that, we've lost league titles because of those corrupt cunts. The rest of what you say I can somewhat understand your grievances I guess."
"Literally ""There are children starving in Africa"" logic."
Weird comment
"He's literally just talking about a football team dude this example is literally nothing alike 😭😭


Manufactured outrage, people love to be offended just for the sake of it"
I've thought about this a couple of times this season when our league campaign has gone off the rails. I've come to the conclusion that it isn't how big you are/where you are in the league that matters it's whether or not your team is getting better or worse. No one is going to Southampton this season as their fans despair going yeah but you could be Oldham so cheer up you spoiled cunt
Suffering is just the feeling. You can suffer knowing your team should be better and used to be better and haven't won anything in a long time but still compete. Some decent heartbreak and suffering there getting close
"Also worth noting he was a part of those teams who showed flashes of brilliance, even broke the trophyless drought but never actually won the league. I imagine it feels more personal (even if he had a great career post-Arsenal to make up for it)."
like i said it's not really about him just pl fans in general
Fuckin eh we do.
Yeah but its a little bit smaller potatoes than that so you would hope they could have some perspective
nah I’d obviously give it to Spurs
Checks out. Arsenal are nobodies 😂🫵
It would cut the chants they can do against us by 50%.
He’s also by far the most hated manager we’ve had recently. He’s renowned for saying that you need to suffer to perform.
"I was analyzing only this quote, and is not same, if Arsenal goes into final with Inter then he is wishing Inter to win."
That bear's name? Wojtek.
There is bear cum
https://youtu.be/OLmQTIS9Rv4?si=AHTgHwxoYPP_0zCD
How much content of this have you consumed to make such a parallel?
it really doesn't
"I think that was the wrong german. Lehmann 'only' sent racist whatsapp message and it was a chainsaw/saw. Not an axe...like that makes it any better lol.

But I've not heard about the first part unless something else came to light since the last I heard about Lehmann"
getting yourself sent off 18 minutes into a champions league final (2006 Arsenal vs Barcelona)
isn't the one possessing cp Metzelder? or did he doing that too?
lehmann didnt possess anything of that nature
"Cut him some slack, he is literally ignorant"
redditors try to understand humor? that’s too high a bar you’re setting mate
You’re absolutely right. When I saw what Real Madrid fans talk about how they suck because they haven’t won the Champions League every year I suddenly understood how we look to the small clubs. In my defence there’s no way I could have been a local Millwall fan. Bermondsey but far too brown.
They always love to act like they can relate because they haven't had a trophy for a few years.
But also supporting Tranmere Rovers over Everton or Liverpool doesn’t make you Jesus Christ. It’s a choice.
"I understand that a eg United fan might complain about a mid table or bottom half finish, but what I absolutely cant stand is when fans of big clubs complain about their ""disappointing seasons"" even when they still make European footy."
"Don't even have to go that far back to be honest, I remember having to listen to pirated BBC Newcastle radio streams (Pepe FM) for Championship games because there was no broadcast of the games and you couldn't even listen to BBC Newcastle without and actual FM Radio as it wasn't broadcast on the BBC site."
"Wednesday fans don't constantly talk how terribly long-suffering they are though, nor do the likes of Bolton or Blackburn or any of the myriad other clubs who've spent years away from the station to which they are accustomed. It's a particularly big club phenomenon."
"""If you eat caviar everyday, it's difficult to return to sausages""

- Arsene Wenger."
"It’s relative. If your club became used to a certain standard you wouldn’t accept going down a level or two. 

 But we do know how this line feels: having to repeatedly sell their best players…

We had to do that for about 15 years straight whilst still trying to compete with the clubs buying them. The decade after the 04 title we spent less than even you, and we always hear about how stingy Ashley was. That budget, whilst trying to compete for trophies isn’t exactly having it easy. Wenger worked miracles."
"Well, the third point was very much true of Arsenal for a time tbf"
"Yes, 2008-2013, they were very close to not being able to cover wages, had to sell all the best players.

And I'll tell you, the banter years were more fun than finishing second three years in a row.

I'm guessing you're mostly younger fans, but I still can't believe the above post is serious. The club has truly bounced back."
"thankfully they were able to buy their way into top flight football, otherwise who knows what would have happened had they remained sixth in division 2

edit: downvoted for light humour, are we really this thinskinned"
"top 6 fans end up ‚miserable‘ because the only connection to the club 90% of the fans online have is success, and if that doesn‘t happen they‘ve got nothing left. the world would be a better place if those people would just shut up from time to time, respectfully."
"He was way more traumatic for Jamie Carragher. Say what you want about Carragher (he definitely has his bad points) but he knows ball and he is very honest about his own career. He’s perhaps a bit self-deprecating (you don’t make 700+ appearances for Liverpool if you’re a bad player), but he is open about his playing weaknesses. 

Jamie Carragher has said multiple times that the prospect of facing Henry would keep him up at night, and that he’d go into a game against Henry just hoping to not be embarrassed by him."
And Danny Mills
"poor neville, losing that one title to Arsenal in '98 must really keep him up at night, he has to settle for his    
\*checks notes\*  

eight others"
You clearly didn’t watch football. Neville was stuck with Pires and Henry stayed more with the Cb
"There were other players too - henry has stayed in the media but Bergkamp, Vieira, Pires etc. Tony Adams and really that whole back line. Later Fabregas etc. too"
"Partly true, as a kid I loved a lot of PL players but also SAF, Mourinho and Wenger"
Especially foreign fans
Compared to the non sky six you are
"No you've lost league titles due to form nothing more, if you cant accept that you'll never win it."
Except it's football teams and winning trophies
The example is to highlight the scale of difference. Arsenal are in the top 1% of football clubs in England and they're talking about constant suffering bro
"then I'll be happy when we're tenth next season

surely"
"Genuinely asking, has anyone mentioning that someone else has it worse then you changed your mind or your perspective on something? 
These have always just been dead-end arguments for me."
How have you not been able to understand that he obviously hopes for more than one thing - and the other thing is obviously that Barcelona beats Inter?
That episode of Brickleberry was awesome
"If I speak, I am in trouble"
"> Lehmann 'only' sent racist whatsapp message and it was a chainsaw/saw. Not an axe...like that makes it any better lol.

Wait. What?"
You're right; also it wasn't an axe in Lehmann'd case but a chainsaw
Learning a lot today
"Right now, I wish my team were Tranmere Rovers"
"No it doesn’t. But if you’re from Bolton and support Man Utd, and say “nobody has it worse than us” while being the FA Cup champions and on a European semifinal you are insane and should be ridiculed."
if your family supports them or you actually grow up around there it‘s not a choice no. you don‘t choose your football club.
"Disappointing is relevant to expectations, so I do understand if say, a City fan was disappointed with how the season went. But if they said, “nobody has it worse than us” or complain about how tough it is to be a City fan they’re insane."
They do talk about how massive and brilliant they are all the time.
"> It's a particularly big club phenomenon.

And what's a ""big club"" is relative even in football. Pretty sure there's loads of football fans tired of ""English football club fans talking like only the PL matters"". 

It's ultimately the media and size of the fanbase that blows things up. Obviously you're not going to see the likes of Bolton or Blackburn fans have a little moan day in day out on social media or have an AFTV-style meltdown because those don't make for great clickbait."
"That's my issue. 

It's not relative. All clubs don't suffer equally.

Frequent disappointment is not ""constant pain""."
weren't you guys relegated either way 🤔
You are aware that Henry came to Arsenal in '99 right?
Was more aimed at his attitude towards Arsenal after his playing days
Henry drifted to the left to link up with Pires (and Cole) a lot. He rarely stayed upfront. You may want to rewatch matches before confidently stating things.
I do like the idea that the only thing standing between Arsenal and the title is Reddit user DurantsTheGoat admitting that we still lose far too many games in a run at the end of a season.
"I've already accepted we'll never win it again whilst the pgmol are in charge, I mean that seriously, I don't even watch the pl games anymore only the highlights, no point taking the league seriously when we can all see some teams are treated differently than others."
"He's an ex-Arsenal player, not your ordinary fan. No shit he's going to feel a lot more emotionally. Plus, regardless of how good your team is, if you tell me you watch any single match without an emotional rollercoaster of ""oh fuck oh fuck will we win oh god we're so shit yay we won"", I'd ask if you'd even watched matches at all. 

Every single fan will go through that. Not just your top clubs, but even your local amateur team. The rollercoaster is part and parcel of football fandom."
"Yeah plenty of times, but only when it's about something that isn't that meaningful and so it's a correct assertion. Someone saying ""but at least you have iPhone"" if you complain about politics in western countries is dumb as hell but sports is very much a different cup of tea for me."
"He called a German pundit a 'token black guy', which led him being fired from his role with Hertha Berlin and in terms of the roofing incident:

>On the first day of the trial, Lehmann admitted that he had entered the garage with a chainsaw in his hand, but argued it was coincidental that he was carrying it at the time. He said he couldn't remember much else about the incident.

Oh sorry officer, I've no idea how that tree fell down - Local man said holding chainsaw.

He sawed off a roof beam in the garage. Very Jens of him!"
"Come on mate we've all sent racist whatsapp or two, or three."
unfortunately
Which I guess is sort of the *opposite* problem...
"But you can make this argument for any club at any level, which is why this point is stupid. My club has it worse than Arsenal so Arsenal fans can’t complain. Why do you have a right to complain compared to a club that’s never made it to a professional division or has stopped existing due to financial struggles?"
"we were 20th, chelsea 19th, both should have been relegated

imo either 1 and 2 with no relegation up or 1-4 up and chelsea spurs relegated would have been reasonable

but also this was 106 years ago so no one has a personal stake in the history"
More like the entire fanbase
"> but only when it's about something that isn't that meaningful and so it's a correct assertion

Pointing out that someone else is worse off is a logical fallacy.
The conclusion - that someone else is worse off - is not related in any way to your situation, its an entirely different premisse.

Plus if this was a legit argument, then the inverse would be a legit argument as well, wich means, you could simply point at Real Madrid and start yapping about how bad you have it as well..."
I'm sorry. What in the fuck? He lost his mind or something? Or was he always a racist nutcase?
*narrows eyes (in Lehmann's general direction)*
"Arsenal fans are in the top 1% who regularly watch their team win major trophies, compete in European football, have never faced relegation, get to watch some the best players in the world on their team. It's on another level of privilege. But more importantly than all that, how many fanbases below them act like supporting their team is 'constant suffering'? How many act like they're the victims of english football?. Obviously Arsenal are allowed to complain and moan but to act like it's constant suffering is just ridiculous."
Nobody says Arsenal fans can't complain?
yeah it doesn't really matter in the end you came back up soon after.
The missus has never listened to me that my yelling at the TV screen had any effect. Now she must face this incontrovertible proof.
I disagree.
"He's always been a hothead on the field. Similar to Oliver Kahn as well. Someone in the know would have to say otherwise, but he never came across as anything but that, so I'm unsure if that was always there and was smart enough to say it in private where it never left the room."
Never met a keeper before?
"> He lost his mind or something? 

what a magic"
"By that logic, West Ham and Newcastle fans are in the 1% who have watched their teams win trophies, and now aren't allowed to have a moan about their club not ""meeting expectations"". 

Surely you see how silly this is. Also, this is a *professional footballer who played for Arsenal* saying it, not your usual Arsenal fan. I think people are taking him far too literally when he probably just means the emotional rollercoaster every football fan watching their team play goes through week in, week out. And if he isn't, he has a stronger emotional bond to the club than an ordinary fan. Man was tearing up about leaving Arsenal."
"With what exactly?

Killer-Arguments are logical fallacies designed to end a conversation or an argument, by denying a statement or an argument validity, without engaging with them on a factual level.

Feel free to elaborate how that kind of argument progresses the discussion, or adds anything to the content layer."
">By that logic, West Ham and Newcastle fans are in the 1% who have watched their teams win trophies

Yep and if you ever catch me saying that it's constant suffering then feel free to tell me to shut up"
"Well, are you an ex-West Ham player who teared up when leaving the club? If there's anyone who gets to say ""loving this club is constant suffering"" it's anyone who's actually left blood, sweat and tears for the club in question.

Sure it's a bit eye-rolling if a fan does it but people are acting like Szczesny is some random hobo off the street."

Conceded the first shot on target the for 22nd game this season
He absolutely twated that fuck me
Ball don't lie.
Sarr deserves a lot of credit here.  Great effort to get the ball and great pass to find Eze.
Anthony Taylor you fucking bald bastard are you gonna rule that out too?
"Absolute belter, Eze is him"
"Great strike and finish, but I feel like a shot from that far not in the corner, the keeper should do better"
Best keeper in the WEEEEERLD
What a strike
Great Goal flair where
"Whatever else, he will always have this goal. Replayed for eternity as one of the 5 FA goals."
Que jugador
What a strike. Villa has been really underwhelming so far
Scorcher of a goal
The curl on the replay is gorgeous 😍😍
Would be nice if we could score first time from anywhere on the fucking pitch 
Justice for getting fucking robbed of that Mateta goal.
"I'd expect better from ""the best goalkeeper in the world"" tbh."
I KNEW IT! He is so fucking good this lad.
What a goal
I'm starting to believe palace can do it this year. Let's go!
Oozes aura like Ivan
Cold celebration to boot
"How is this buried below 20+ stupid Real posts.

Amazing strike by Eze"
Anthony fuck taylor can't argue with that
thundercunted it top bins
Yeah they're done
Impossible to save that shot... Best gk in the world btw.
Please do it palace
"no offense to Crystal Palace, but he is too good to be playing there"
Justice for that awful decision prior. Fantastic goal
And conceded the rebound in a further 3.
"Most goals conceded after 90th min. 

We’ve also got to be in for Most goals conceded by first shots of the match."
Is this a real stat? Surely not
42% of our games this season. Has to be a record
That's a proper big club stat.
Should Martinez have done better?
No thanks your not my type
Ball don’t lie.
Ball don’t lie
Goal disallowed: Bad vibes.
"he thought it was going top right, with that much speed it's easy to get wrong footed"
Seems harsh. You can’t expect him to save that. He’s up in Liverpool preparing for the Tottenham match
"Clearly should move to a prestigious club like Spurs, who are competing for European silverware"
"And this my friends, is the reason the same few clubs win everything"
"he'll probably upgrade in the summer but it was smart that they didn't lose both Olise and Eze in the same season, altho with the state of the bottom 3 they still probably would've been fine"
"On the one hand it's harsh, because as you can see that this Palace team is challenging for silverware, on the other hand you are right..."
Love unai and Martinez but there’s big flaws in our game this season and they’re not being addressed
I wish I was exaggerating for comedic effect.
+3 rebounds from the first shot on target 🙃
"Fuck off, respectfully Ass_Eater_"
Gone past him by the time he's got up. Too much swaz on it
I'm sure he'll be upset with himself but there was so much bend on the ball I can understand why he initially moved to his left. He just couldn't change his momentum quick enough
"Whipped it behind the defenders leg and with such pace, no chance really"
QPR legend.
Ball don't lie.
"Yeah, sometimes it's about split second decisions in getting your body set, and he got this wrong and Eze hit it perfectly. 

So it goes."
And think what he could learn from BJ the goat
Your profile is genuinely insane

Man already on life-changing money:
"Tebas will go berserker rage in order to prevent another Neymar situation and make no mistake the saudis have started directly to shop from Madrid, Barca and Atleti these were non-selling teams and still are but the money the Saudis are throwing around is dangerous they offered Vini 1 billion usd contract and has changed things the Saudis can now shop there..

If PSG buying Neymar and Mpabbe for 400 million usd was financial Doping according to Tebas own words then this Saudi offers is financial Nuclear..

The biggest threat to La Liga was the Qataris and Emirates but now the Saudis are the front-runners and Tebas is gonna come after them rest assured"
"> Anyone who says he won’t go is lying

Didn't some players/managers do just that?"
Such a balanced take on the matter. So much better than those who pretend that the money had no sway over the decision.
"Here is the English transcript of what he said in the video:

""I didn't expect it, I didn't expect it, I saw it yesterday, someone sent me the proposal from Arabia, right? I saw it yesterday and it actually took me by surprise, but they are really high numbers. I would go for 1 billion reais. Man, they are really high numbers. If I had, in fact, if I had, I wouldn't have said that, I think I would have gone, you know? I think I would have gone, and now, why, Man, I would have gone, because first of all, **I was mentally a little down**, let's say, and that would solve my life, my wife's life, my family's life, it was a value that would solve our life, it would solve our life, and the person who says they wouldn't go is a liar, because it's impossible for you to see values ​​of that magnitude and not think that it would change your life and be able to GO, but on the other hand, I thought that I still had a lot to give here in Europe, right? I still had a lot to give for this club and I still had a lot of possibilities to continue wearing the national team's shirt, so that motivated me to close my ears a little to money, right? and open my mind more to dreams."""
"It has never been a morality issue for me because what is the real difference between being paid by a Sheik in Europe like Man City and Newcastle, PSG etc and being paid by a Sheik in Saudi Arabia?  The disappointing thing is seeing players with potential to compete at the top level wasting their prime years in a lacklustre league."
"As in the wise words of Chunkz when asked if he would switch from beta squad to sidemen ;

""Tomorrow I'd go"""
Best answer I’ve heard so far to such situation
"Earning 50 million euros instead of 10 per year will ""change your life""?"
Kan somebody tell him he is already the 1% of the 1%
"Now this is beautiful. Staying on chump change in Spain out of pure love for the game.

Imagine what going from 1 Ferrari a month to 3 can do for someone, seeing some of these guys just walk away from it. Wow."
Change your life? In what way? You can own 3 more lambos instead of the 1 you already own? These players at the highest level already earn an amount in half a year that most people don’t in their entire lifetime. They don’t have to go to saudi to make sure even their grandchildren don’t have to work ever again if they don’t want to. Stop the cap.
"People saying going from his current salary, tax-cut and all that to a tax-free million a week or something isn’t much of an upgrade, you know how all of us here are middle class lol

The richer you get the more money you want to have, misconception is when you’re already rich you can buy what you want, not true, you will struggle to open doors for yourself and your family and hop on investment opportunities and open up your business or just find shit to do in your later age, that needs more money, and more money can never be bad."
Would not have needed to ask me twice if I ever became a pro
Thank you Raphinha.
"Every time this topic pops up, I truly see how out of touch most of Reddit is with human psyche. Shocker that someone who makes good money wants more."
"For peeps in here that keep asking why? The answer is ""why not"". If i'm at the end of my career and someone offers me that much it's totally normal to nod"
"I don't really get the moral argument here.

  
The Saudi league is the dumbist thing ever. They are ploughing billions of dollars into an enterprise that has no chance of being a top league. None. 

The leaders of Saudi are bad people. They're despotic rulers who have sold their countries natural wealth for the benefit of the very few. If they want to make a massive transfer of that wealth to the west for no real benefit to themselves, LET THEM. Bow and say nice things to their face, then laugh behind their back as they fritter away their temporary wealth."
"Its same for every job. If i got offered to go to saudi for 10x what i earned currently, on contractual terms for fixed years, doing the same job i did but with less pressure, you damn sure i will take the offer. 

Certain people, with talent and the passion for the industry and the aspiration to go all the way to senior leadership might want to consider betting on themselves. But for someone who know their ceilings, arabs contract is always the most profitable option."
I seriously think the Club World Cup is just a huge sportswashing event in itself
What's wrong with wanted to earn more money tho? It's kinda weird in this sub
This is his way of asking for a little bit more money from Saudi
"I probably don’t have a popular opinion but I’d take the money. If your goal is to play and make money, go for Saudi. If your goal is to play, make a name and challenge the greats, stay. Knowing what to do with your earning is also important. Will you invest/find business partners or party? If you party go to Saudi, if you know how to healthy spend your earnings and make a return/more money, stay."
"Believe it or not, refusing free money is a surprisingly hard thing to do. And anyone that says otherwise is just being annoying for the sake of being annoying"
How much was the offer? Any guesses?
TIL Raphina uses ears to see.
"If i was already crazy rich (like a top footballer) I wouldn't go, for my currently wages I would because it means none of of my family would need to work again for the rest of their lives.

And then after a few years I can leave."
"Just a little, you say."
"Full interview (in portuguese) here:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b53GD016Zt8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b53GD016Zt8)"
Good for him for being honest and transparent about his thoughts
"I think those who want to win titles and build a legacy, good on them, but the reason why they all pursued football given that most of them came from poor backgrounds was the money, so none of these guys should be shamed for going to Saudi. It's just like you getting a job offer in a better paying startup and leaving Microsoft or AWS for that job."
"in my opinion he can get same deal or better a few years down the road when hes older , no point in moving to saudi league during his prime"
He could go to Saudi in the last 3 years of his playing days and still earn at least as much.
man modern brazilians are such mercenaries. saudi league is full of brazilians. maybe that's why they haven't won a world cup in decades. it's a shame.
The whole basis of humanity just seems to be greed
"Life chaning money and this dude is already making 12,5 mil Euro per season :)

It's more like fuck you money if he goes to the arab league."
He is right. That amount of money makes you think. I would say even more of you come from somewhere growing up poor and where your whole extended family or even the whole village will try to exploit you.
"And people in here saying ""He earns more than 99% of the people on earth why would he take it?""

Because like he said, its a lifechanging offer. Even if he earns lets say 10 million, Earning 100million is a difference. 

  
Ye he can feed his family and send his kids to school, but if he can do more than that, whats the problem?

Imagine you can buy a football team for example and play Football Manager IRL. That would be awesome."
I’d go to Saudi in a heartbeat. Morals mean nothing when we’re talking millions
"Wish those leaving the Bundesliga, Ligue 1 etc. for the PL or La Liga would say the same. 


Or the ones leaving bottom table teams could stay and offer more to that club. "
How much would it change his life really?
"It's still good leverage to get more from his club and country. Good for him, he deserves it."
Leeds United were idiots to let him go for the price they did
Embarrassing statement from someone playing at Barcelona making 12 million a year
"Much funnier if he went to Saudi Arabia though, would love to see this sub have a moral high ground meltdown"
"Actually, some people give a shit about human rights."
"How much more life changing can money really be when you’re already paid an absolute fuck ton anyway?

These people are universally tone deaf"
"Most of the people here are hypocrites. justification of personal lifestyle and needs should be stopped . I use a redmi note 8 pro (7 year old phone) and a core 2duo pc and i can say it works really fine for me  but this doesn't give me reasons to go against people using iphones and modern pcs , which most of the redditors use .so please shut the fuck up that you don't need more than 200k and all."
"I don't care what anyone says. Getting paid 400k a week instead of 200k a week is meaningless. 

Nobody needs more money than being paid 200k a week..."
Yeah but a 50 meter long boat must be so much better than one only measuring 40 meters. And it’s basically inhumane to have a home that doesn’t have 20 bathrooms. #lifegoals
"His life won’t change, he will just be able to feed more cousins in the favelas, which is a noble goal I guess.

Anyway past the point of footballer money I think they look to just own more assets, and truly create wealth that last 10 generations"
It's the difference between being set for life and your entire extended family + next two generations being set for life too. I am willing to bet the vast majority of people whining about this would take the offer in a heartbeat too.
"According to salarysport.com Raphina gets about 10 million dollars a year, on salary. Additional commercial fees excluded. I can’t imagine what it’s like to feel tempted to earn triple that."
Mpabbe reads very funny lol
"I thought that so far Saudi clubs had offered large wages but their transfer fees haven’t been outstanding. 

Outside of the €90m (per transfermarkt) for Neymar they all seem fairly in line with what the players would have cost transferring to any European side. 

Yes there’s plenty of big fees, but besides that 1 none of them seem unusual at all glance, and not even near PSG buying Mbappe & Neymar level. The wages are a separate matter."
Saudi are buying from us but they are going for our younger players who are struggling to break through the first team. And honestly the potential saudi players dont seem like players who want to actually go there
"lol, Tebas doesn’t care about any team that isn’t Real Madrid. In fact, he was hoping Olmo would accept an offer from another club in order to fuck up the clubs finances. That’s why he reneged so much on registering the player when he had no authority to do so. 

It’s not the first time either. He did the same thing with Gavi. He has a long history of trying to fuck over Barcelona. It’s funny actually. For all the talk about him “not getting along with Florentino,” we never see him trying to fuck over Real Madrid by refusing to register their players or refusing to accept, say “concert money” as part of the FFP calculation.

When we sold a stake of our media rights to Six Street, our dear buddy Tebas, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING SEASON, rushed to change the laws in order to not count assets sold as part of the FFP margin. He did that specifically to fuck over Barcelona when we were doing that.

He also said he has his own player valuation when we tried to register Joao Felix for 400.000 a year. He counted 4 million euros a year because he didn’t want clubs making “creative accounting” with the finances. 

He hasn’t said shit about Madrid’s concert being cancelled."
"He himself says he's not going.

Obviously what he meant was that anyone who doesn't even consider the offer is lying"
His teammate himself (Szczęsny) retired instead of going to saudi.
"There's an error in the translation. 


The best would be ""Anyone who says they *wouldn't* go is lying"""
Redditors try to understand context challenge: IMPOSSIBLE
"Yeah, and he’s calling them liars."
"Yeah, didn't they offer Mbappe like a billion per year or something crazy like that?"
"I think it's more towards your average joe fan, who criticises player for it."
"His words were that he could have left if this offer came in a different moment of his career, he is now a golden ball contender and in this context he is not leaving. The Saudis obviously only drop those high values on very high profile players, that's why many refuse since they're still on top, it's exactly what Raphinha is doing now."
"Raphina himself in this video says he won’t go, immediately after telling us that anyone who says they won’t go is lying. I’m not sure he’s got the best assessment of the situation."
"When a guy who is already a millionaire tells you the money they are offering could change his life, then we better believe him. Lol."
"I get it, but what I absolutely hate is when people label it as “generational wealth” for them. My guy they already have generational wealth, it’s insulting to the likes of us peasants hearing it put that way."
Hey now Captain Hendo went there to start a conversation about LGBT rights. It was more activism than money that drove his decision.
"I do truly believe some of them don’t care about the money. A lot of these guys are crazy wealthy and they can already have any lifestyle they like. Money really isn’t everything and for people who have it, usually less so. There’s a lot of noise about how the rich always want to be richer but some of these footballers grew up in poverty and are now millionaires. That’s got to be enough for some of them."
What is the next step of the operation?
"that is not well translated and in fact I kinda feel like I'm in bizarro world in this thread. He is talking about the past. He literally says the words ""in the past"". And then he literally says ""on the other hand, I felt I had more to give"". He is not talking about the possibility of moving now that he's at Barça or even being tempted now, he's saying it would have given him pause in the past. He says it would have changed his life then, not now"
This saudi issue always was about europeans getting mad that their best players are leaving their leagues.
I agree with you
Most people would choose to make a lot of money without having to do too much work but that's unrealistic unless you're a certain gender. The Saudi league is like only fans for football players. They don't have to overexert themselves to make good money.
"You know, we say the same thing about our players in Brazil leaving the country's top clubs to waste their careers playing for fucking Wolverhampton.

Money talks."
"I dont Think any Chelsea fans has gone “you know what, Russia aint bad, better start going there” due to Roman owning the club. However having your favourite players at Saudi Will either force you to go there if you want to watch Them or boycut the sport you love. "
"This was the first quote that came to mind, great to see this on r/soccer lol"
KDB said the same and people said he was twerking for Saudi LOL.
"It is different. 10M gives you 5M tax free which yields a few hundred thousand a year. They make that for 5+ years the issue is that they don’t accumulate wealth, most players blow all the money off. 50M tax free yields 7 figures per year. It is life changing since it is per a fewer years. "
they're the real heroes here
How are you going to drive 3 Ferraris at the same time?
Going from 200k per week to 2 mil per week is a huge difference
"i never understood these reddit takes

like u literally just heard the player himself saying life changing but you're still arguing against it

he obviously thinks going from 200k per week to 2mil per week is massive idk why randos on reddit with 50k per annum try to justify that it isn't"
Careers can end just like that to be fair. It's not like normal 9 to 5. They spent their whole livelihoods to react to a point to get monies as much as they can to set up for their family's future.
For most it's a job where you have to make the most money before retiring. Not everyone plays for the love of the game alone.
"I don't know. He didn't receive this amount of money for the rest of his life. He may have gotten an injury that shortened his career and prevented him from having stable finances for his family.

He may live for more than 60 years and have to care for his family, possibly facing illnesses that require significant expenses.  Anything can happen."
">Change your life? In what way? You can own 3 more lambos instead of the 1 you already own?

"If I read another ""how many sports cars can someone have?""...

I feel like I'm becoming dumber by osmosis while i stay in this thread."
"I dont understand the moral highground of not playing in Saudia Arabia or any Middle-East country for that matter.

By your argument going to the MLS should be scrutinized as much because ""the country leaders are bad people and are funding a genocide""

Or staying in the Premier League because the United Kingdom was built on the back of South East asia and countless other colonies and oh again with the unwavering support to a nation that is commiting genocide at the moment.

So please tell me where the moral highground comes from"
"You say for the very few, but the very few are their own citizens. For example they pay them a universal basic income which is only possible by exploiting a massive migrant population. There’s a lot of people in the West right now who’d agree with the idea of a two tier society with citizens at the top."
"> The leaders of Saudi are bad people. They're despotic rulers who have sold their countries natural wealth for the benefit of the very few.


That's like US right now. UK isn't too far away when most properties in London are owned by so few and has become a safe haven for money launderers all over the world and spend their money on. Don't try to get on some high horse"
"""No real benefit"" if they become the local center for fotball, it adds to economic activity outside of oil/gas, which is their longterm goal. "
What does Saudi do that your own country hasn't done morally?
This is actually the only good reason for taking the bag.
"It isn't the same, as 10x a normal salary changes things about the material reality of your life.

Going from €10m to €100m a year doesn't buy you a bigger house, a faster car, nicer holidays, better schools for your kids, nicer meals out, less financial stress, etc.

If you go from €50k to €500k your entire life changes, even though it's ""only"" €450k extra. That isn't the case from €10m to €100m"
La Liga buys far less than Bundesliga or Serie A lol. Not sure about Ligue 1
"We paid £18m for him and got £60m two years later. He wanted to go, so keeping him wasn't really an option. 

He was great for us, but nobody expected him to get to this level. After his first year Barca were on about getting rid."
"Don't pretend to be a dumbass who can't read in other to bait rage. He's basically saying that, people who say money has no influence in their decisions are lying.  
If he was in an Ivan Toney or Jhon Duran situation with nothing to play for, he would be moving."
">would love to see this sub have a moral high ground meltdown

you don't have enough of that on r/gunners already?"
It's easy to be moral over a place like Saudi? What's wrong with that. They're not a good country
"If I was Raphinha won CL, La Liga and had a big chance to Ballon Dor.

  
Bro Im on first plane flying to Saudi"
"You're joking, right? This whole concept is just plain stupid. If I was a pro footballer, and I refuse an offer from the MLS worth a few hundred million dollars because the US as a country is against my moral values, I'd be ridiculed. But, as an Iraqi, the US has done far more damage to my country than Saudi Arabia ever did. We are still paying for their actions two decades later on a daily basis. And as a Kurdish person, I should also boycott the premiere leage as well, because they brutally suppressed nationalist movements in the early 20th century when they occupied Iraq. You can find an argument against any pro football league if we are bringing politics into it. 

Just FYI, I hate everything that the state of Saudi Arabia represents, and in no way will I ever condone their behavior. It's just that it all seems a bit funny when people talk about human rights and expect footballers to pick up the weight of geopolitics on their shoulders."
I love how your standard Redditor postures on here with this bullshit like they’d take the moral high ground instead of 50 million a year…
I would gladly give up a job in Saudi that pays less than I'm currently getting.
"Then you'd have to leave planet Earth unfortunately. Right now most countries are either funding a genocide, or turning into a Nazi fascist hellhole, or permitting slavery and using migrants as pawns, or etc etc."
"These guys live the high life and their career is short. Not to mention taxes on their 200k.

Their 400k is tax free"
"It's not meaningless.

It's an older short read, but Jon Ronson and a great piece on this a while ago.

Very short version - whatever level you're on, you can see the things that the next couple levels above you have. You want those things. Some are selfish, some aren't (imagine being able to call upon the best doctor or surgeon in the world if your family member got sick?)."
Probably what people living in extreme poverty think about people in developed countries making 50k vs 100k a year.
You’re thinking of spending it on yourself. When you come from places like Brazil chances are you have a large family with lack of opportunities and experience. That extra 200k is a game changer for them.
"You are saying that because you aren't making 200k a week, if you did, you would have other priorities. I would take that money no questions asked. My problem is now how to survive a month, if I made 200k a week, my problem would be how can I make more."
"I dont want to offend you or anything, but how old are you bro? 

Money will never buy happiness and we all know that, but as Raphinha said in this video ""this money would set my family for life, my wife, and when you see an offer like this, if at least it doesnt cross your mind, then you are lying""... And this is true, you can be a millionare, but this guys are young, if a bunch of arabs ask you ""would you want to come to Saudi Arabia and become 50x or 100x richer"", wouldnt you even consider? 

Raphinha probably has other goals, win more trophies, like CL (wich is the probably the highest you can get), but its actually admirable to see south american players with such good resolves. We need to remember a lot of south american players come from hard places, and being able to help your friend and families when they grow up means a lot to them."
"Tbh that extra 200k is money that could support a decent living for his whole extended family for life, that's probably what most footballers would be thinking."
Like you would have any idea what living with either salary is like...
"I agree that nobody needs >200k/week, but the difference between 400k and 200k isn’t meaningless. That’s putting a multiplier on a shit ton of money. Especially when you consider the poverty that Raphina has described coming from. Idk how charitable he is but if he’s anything like Sadio Mane, who has been funding UBI in his Senegalese village for years, it makes sense that these guys accept godfather offers to play outside of Europe. Hell, even if he wants to keep it for his family, it secures multiple generations of wealth. 

I don’t want players of his quality to leave for Saudi in their prime, but we can’t deny the difference between 10M and 20M per year. Staggering amounts of money."
"It SHOULD be meaningless but clearly it’s not if everyone is going to Saudi and Raphinha is speaking this way towards the offer. 

So your statement does not reflect reality."
"Depends on how many mouths you are feeding. I'm not just talking about your kids. When you get there, you might feel like you owe a lot to a lot of people."
"I mean it's relative. Assuming you're in UK, a person from 3rd world could very well the say same thing about your salary."
Try that when you earn that much. It’s absolutely a big boost to circumstances especially if you are living at your wealth level to begin with - rich want to get richer. I honestly think 100% of this subreddit would jump and do the same
Actually it’s very different. You can do way more with 400k a month than 200k
"Given his stature a conservative guess is that he will have been offered about a quarter of a billion quid over 3-4 years. Tax free.

Even if you make 10mil a year at Barca, that's still life changing. I don't think it's just about going from the stainless steel patek to the white gold one. That's going from being ""set up for a very comfortable life if you invest appropriately"" to total financial freedom for generations of descendants. Not to mention genuine power if you wish to wield it."
Let us know when you're in that position and you stick to your ground and turn it down. Until then...
Most people adjust their lifestyle to fit their income. Doubling your salary is life changing and definitely not meaningless. Whether you go from 5k to 10k a month or 200k to 400k per week.
"But you can always do more money. Sponser more orphans and kids from poor backgrounds to university, build schools and hospitals in neglected areas. Even at a personal level, he do more for his kids and future grandkids with more money. Buy/build companies for them, build houses for them etc. The world will never run out of problems that can be solved with money."
"When will people understand that for many players, especially from non western European countries, that them earning big bucks means them being to not only able support their families but their entire communities back home as well 

For many families and communities having someone they know/from their town making it big may be their only hope for a better life. Earning 200k may mean you can take care of your family well, while earning 400k may mean the kids in your hometown get a new football field or academy so that they have a better chance to succeed 

This is especially true for many Brazilian players"
"There is absolutely if you can only earn that amount for 10 years.  

  And I don’t care what anyone says,  in the opposite direction.  If you were given the choice it would be hard to turn down 400k"
"Yeah sure, ""getting paid less is more meaningful to getting paid more""? The mental gymnastics to explain morality are ridiculous. You can't blame anyone for chasing more money. Life is short. This is business. Football is not a simple game for some time now."
While he is on 200k right now in Saudi ge would earn almost million a week.
"Well that all depends how many people they are supporting too.

Remember these players come from some of the poorest areas so sending money and taking care of those family members is an added pressure.

The HBO Maradona doc really highlighted this well. He was the main breadwinner for his family by the time he was 13-14 if I recall correctly."
"Buddy I see what you’re trying to say, and i’m so so sorry, but you’re taking the piss."
No but there's a difference between 400k per week and multiple millions per week
"Nobody needs more money than being paid 200k a week...

lol anyone who want to live a luxurious life need 400k a week without tax.

anyone who wants to not just uplift their main family but also their extended family from poverty also would need those money.

people just saying this because they don't earn that much and green with envy.

honestly i couldn't care less about how much these footballer makes, good for them if they make more."
You could buy an extra yacht.
"Nah, this shouldn't even be a hot take. You're 100% right."
"It does for your descendants, it wont really matter for him"
"And playing soccer is meaningfull? Lol
The only reason he is in spain is money."
"Doubling your salary is meaningless? $10m/yr vs $5m/yr is meaningless? Especially considering he will be retired sometime in the next 10 years, and he will presumably have 50 something more years to live and enjoy his life and give something to his family. 

He's only been on life-changing money since maybe 2020, and half of that is gone in taxes. 

Anyone in their right might who has a 10 year window to earn as much as possible would take as much as they can get."
The more you earn the more you spend. It evens out somehow
"They don't work forever, only till they're 35. And they're taxed heavily in Europe, whereas Saudi has 0 income tax. I'm not at all implying that what he makes in Barca isn't sufficient but you have to realize how massive the difference is. Remember that he's probably also trying to set his family and friends up for life too, or maybe even start societal initiatives/charity etc eventually."
Thats a massive difference and while it might not affect your life it certainly can with the people around you. Thats so much extra money that you can literally set up for life everyone you care about without tapping into your own If that makes sense
"Sorry bro, but you don’t get to make decisions like that for other people. That’s not how the world works, sorry to break it to you mr Reddit hero"
"


1. Fuck letting a billionaire keep my money because “I have enough”.  They also have enough, way more than me, and im the one kicking the ball. Pay me.  

2. doubling your wages doing an easier job, idc if you make 20k a year or 200 million, who isn’t considering that offer and why?  Other than glory or politics, I don’t think there’s anything wring with taking double money and playing in a weaker league.  Just a question of how much you value glory and your principles."
Where you are 1injury away from earning nothing.
">I am willing to bet the vast majority of people whining about this would take the offer in a heartbeat too.

I love most about this common af argument that it is based on 0 fucking evidence, not everyone was born greedy as multi millionaire/billionaire/trillionaires"
I personally wouldn't at least. And I can say that with confidence because I have opportunities to double my salary that I've turned down because it would lower my life satisfaction overall. But I'm lucky enough to be financially comfortable and my family is all self sufficient and financially stable as well.
"I suppose you're right but the hunger is there. I remember the height of 2022 of tech jobs, I got an offer for $180k/yr while living in the South and my first thought was ""I wish it was more"" and not ""Holy smokes."" Rode that wave for 2 years.

I make considerably less now thanks to layoffs but it was a nice ride."
Probably because they have to pay incredibly high wages to attract players but teams would probably rather sell to Saudi than a domestic or European rival so they won’t need to pay more than other teams necessarily
The crown pays for the wages. The clubs have to fund the transfer fees. Something like that
Didn't Al-Hilal offer $330 million to PSG for Mbappe?
This seems less like him rejecting the move and more like implying that he intends to go there in the future.
Should’ve told him how you can (could?) smoke indoors.
Surely is a bad translation rather than missing context?
If they were offered them contracts and they refused I'm not sure what they are lying about exactly.
And that's a terrible argument
"An average joe fan isn't already a multimillionaire so idk, maybe you're right though."
"A million seconds is 12 days, a billion seconds is 32 years. Always my favorite comparison to put things into a perspective."
It's not going to change **his** life but it would change the life of his relatives and descendants. Millions are millions but they eventually dry.
"Exactly. It is such a delusional take and I dont understand how people cant see that.

""You know I could upgrade my private jet to have a life changing jacuzzi inside a bigger private jet"". Fuck off"
"I don't know raphinias background but anyone who says that someone coming from or close to poverty shouldn't want to make as much money as they can in a short career is clearly coming from a fairly privileged position themselves

The likes of mane building schools and hospitals in senegal with his fortune! He didnt move to saudi for purely selfish reasons

Nothing is certain in football, you could break your leg at any time, dont blame players that see bringing their families/communities out of poverty as more important than silverware that means nothing to the bigger picture"
"Raphinha may be a millionaire, but he only started making big money a few years ago, even though he will be 29 already this year. For players of the caliber of Messi, Mbappe, Lewandowski, Vinicius, moving to Saudi Arabia will not change their lives, but for Raphinha it will be completely different. It will guarantee him a rich life"
if you convert the money to reais - brazils currency - it gets even crazier
It's probably something in the £100m a year mark - and tax free. So probably close to 10x as much. If a professional footballer has a solid 10-15 years in them it's basically more than a lifetime of earnings in just 1 or 2 seasons.
It's ironic how the difference between £5 million and £50 million is not a lot when you have only £50k in the bank but quite a lot when you already have £5 million in your account.
"True, but there's a difference between earning 20-30 mil in your career and having having all the comforts that involves for you and your family and having 10-20x that and having the money to buy businesses, influence politicians and have a real impact on things you care about in the world."
"Yeah, Raphinha is supposedly on 12 millions a year at Barça already. 12 millions a year is like 6 times what the average worker *in rich countries* will make in their WHOLE LIFE. And he's winning that every season !

These guys are so out of touch. He's already set for life and for generations to come. What the fuck is he even talking about ""life changing"". How can his life change for the better when it comes to money ? By going to work in a theocratic monarchy to be able to eat 500 € bills salads for the rest of his life ?

I wish I never got to hear top players talking about money..."
"It's comments like these that make me think all the ""eat the rich"" types (to which i am very sympathetic, for the record) actually just wish they were rich instead."
By your logic if you have a roof over your head and access to water you can’t complain cos it’s insulting
"It has to be a big jump in status and comfort for his entire familiy to go from a net worth of 35m to a net worth of maybe 350m. Millionaire living and Billionaire living surely have to be very distinct and if the Saudi offer is that good maybe that's the change Raphinha is being offered.

Not nearly like going from living in the street to having a roof over your head and a stable job, but we would all look up instead of down in we were in the same situation as Raphinha, most of us do that already."
But not the ones going to Saudi. It's enough for modric and hazard. None of the footballers going to Saudi are doing it for any reason other than money
"For many, it’s really not about the money, but about ego and pride and not in a bad way. Hearing fans chant your name or seeing kids wear your jersey, especially when you’re already rich, is worth more than a few extra millions"
"I think the problem is not the translation, but your interpretation. The transcription clearly shows that he is talking about the past."
"Or just watch different players.

The sport is the product, not players, everyone has forgotten this."
Ehmm.. millions and millions. Not even counting sponsors.
Think of the children for the love of god. If he doesn't increase his Ferrari output his progeny could be in real danger of destitution.
"It's even more than that. In Spain he'll be getting taxed ~50% on his earnings, so that 200k becomes 100k. In Saudi there's no tax on income, so the boost in pay would be massive."
"It's a huge difference in terms of money, but is it a huge difference in terms of your life? 

He already has a huge house, he already has a car that can go 200mph, he can already eat at every restaurant in the world, he can already go on private jets, he can already holiday on a yacht, he can already send his kids to the most expensive school, he can already drink €2000 bottles of wine without blinking, he can already do everything that a person could want to do. 

€10m a year is already enough to do essentially anything in the world. Wanting more is simply greed."
"How?

It literally shouldn't change your quality of life.


Unless you are spending money in stupid ways"
Because its some weird fantasy for these people to pretend they just happen to be morally superior to ALL these dumb atheletes with no morality.
"In some other sports they focus on the total salary over the full period of the contract, so instead of 200k to 2mil per  week it would be from 20m to 200m for a 2 year contract.


It highlights a bit more the difference imo."
"If his career ends tomorrow he's still on 12 millions a year since 2022, including the next season if he gets injured, because their contracts don't end the day they get injured.  
And that's not to speak about his Leeds and Rennes wages which were not meager either.  
He's high past the time when a career-ending injuring could put him in any kind of financial discomfort.

The fact that they even feel like they need more... I hope he's sustaining whole favelas with all that money, to tell us he would consider going to work in a theocratic monarchy just to earn even more."
"That's an argument when you play in the championship, not when you are a big earner at Barcelona..."
"Exactly. Footballers have a very short amount of time where they can earn money, and it can suddenly end at moment."
Most players don't.
"Yeah and it's funny how they are trying to make it seem like athletes are obliged to obey to the fans' needs. ""I don't like Saudi Arabia rulers because they are bad so you should not go play with them"". Childish behaviour."
"> Or staying in the Premier League because the United Kingdom was built on the back of South East asia and countless other colonies

Uh yeah, you do realise people are critical of Saudi Arabia because of what they do *now* not what they were like hundreds of years ago, right? Talking about colonisation in this context is absurd."
Not to play devil’s advocate but any country that stones women because they revealed too much if their body is not to be compared with curent United Kingdom lol
"Huh? Indochina (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) were French colonies, Phillipines was Spanish, Indonesia was Dutch. The English only colonized Malaysia in South East Asia."
"MLS and Premier League are not government back projects to the same extent that the Saudi League is.

There's no comparison."
I'm not sure if you understood my post. You should ask someone who is pushing the moral high ground argument your question.
publicly execute a person per day?
Put people in prison for their sexuality and modern day slavery
">It isn't the same, because ""my absolutely clueless opinion""

What a mug"
"You’re lying to yourself if you’re saying there’s no difference between €10m and €100m per year. That’s the kind of money that your kids, grandkids, and great grandkids couldn’t squander in their lifetime. You would set your kin up with generational wealth and security. Even if that is of no concern to you, would you feel a sense of responsibility to take the money and use it toward philanthropic purposes? And if that’s also not for you, well you could buy your own football club, you could fuck right off and buy a private Caribbean island and a mega yacht to go with it."
Vast majority of people will barely make like 1.5 million in their entire working life. These guys make that in a few months. I'm not shedding any tears for those that don't budget properly for their 'high life and taxes'
"Look. If you get paid 200k a week (plus bunuses) for say 12 years or something like that, and still can't get it so that you don't need any more money in your life, the 400k won't fix that.

It's not a money problem it is a managing problem."
The kind of money they're on in Saudi I don't think even their grandchildren could physically spend in their lifetime. It's sickening. I can't believe when I see people trying to justify these moves that are based solely on greed. The very definition of selling out.
"The money you get in Saudi isn't only in wages, they don't pay for living spaces, cars and mostly anything in Saudi as a superstar, get invites to some of the biggest events in the region all while living tax free, it IS life changing money even if you think otherwise."
I also think a lot of people don't understand they can change their families lives. Most footballers come from very poor backgrounds so an opportunity to make generational income for their families is difficult to deny.
"This is why I said my first sentence. I've heard this argument about 100 times.

There is no reason to earn 400k over 200k, or even 100k a week. There isn't any lifestyle you can't have by earning 400k over the other amount of money. It's all completely meaningless."
Not entirely. Jordan Henderson got washed.
It's 4x the money then
How the fuck do you think the rest of us are getting by if 200k isn't enough then? Stupid.
"Ok, doesn't change the fact they earn more in one year than one person does in 40 years of work."
"Yeah that's the thing. After taxes let's say they earn 120K. I don't want to say most of them, but a large number spend 120K or even more. Once their careers are over, they go broke. That's why the Saudi offers attract them. They can overspend and still have something left."
"> Very short version - whatever level you're on, you can see the things that the next couple levels above you have. You want those things.

100% spot on.

When I was a kid, I made less than 1000€/month and that was plenty, but wanted more. Later I got a ""real job"" and earned 3k/month. That felt amazing, I was able to get my own place, travel, party, whatever - but I wanted a nicer place, a car, what have you. Nowadays I make 20-25k/month and still feel I should make waaaaay more. If someone offered me 50k/month I would be ready to live in fucking Charleroi, or even KSA.. whatever it takes.

It's a vicious circle - especially when you have people around you who make much more than you."
"100%, but they will conveniently ignore that point"
"Extreme poverty in developed countries? Brother I'm doing that shit right now and I earn 7200 usd a year. Shit is a lot here and I still look on to you guys as ""how the fuck are you spending all that"""
"Fuck that, not even close. People in developed countries making 50k a year still spend a multiple to what people in poor countries spend. A meal in 1 country can cost you 2 dollars, while in Western Europe it'll cost you 30 dollars.

We're talking about being super rich anywhere in the world. vs, more money than you can spend."
"Exactly. These dudes are sometimes supporting over 20, maybe 30 people.

All your relatives show up. It's not like in Europe where your family might just be 5 people in total. In South America, your extended family is family.

That's how poor people survive. You help each other out.

If you make it big, and you had like 5 close friends growing up, now you're kinda supporting those 5 dudes' families too. Like, if your friend's sister's kid needs surgery, you're probably gonna have to help support him."
thats true for all footballers no matter the region. how many footballers playing at the very top level come from wealthy backgrounds? most are from poorer backgrounds.
"just buy a house every month, does it by itself"
They are all rich already. They can all do anything they like. He can play football for 5 months and buy them all houses.
these redditors are so delusional thinking they wouldnt take the money lmao
"It’s not an extra 200k period. It’s 200k a week. There’s no issue with simply pointing out the money in modern sports is ridiculous at the top levels.

Many of these players are making considerably more money than a majority of people will make in their lifetime."
"If you’re comfortable you have options. Majority of people live from one paycheck to the next. People buy lottery tickets for a reason, the options that are provided with wealth. An ability to live on your own terms. 

If you’re altruistic, you can effect more meaningful change with wealth and the influence that accompanies it. You can help people, provide employment opportunities, gift some of that wealth, fund libraries, youth centres, run charities and more. 

Most people often don’t have the luxury of creating effective change, because they just about make enough to get by 🤷‍♂️"
"Exactly that, doesnt want to offend anyone"
"Yes, he wants to win the CL and as many trophies as possible and when he starts declining and it's time to cool down, he's open for a move to Saudi-Arabia."
*While playing*
I can already picture him and Nainggolan at Roma smoking at half time
The not going
And still it's a difference if you earn 1 million a month or 6 million
"Are they getting paid in seconds?

I jest,  but yeah, the scale is insane."
Difference between a billion and a million is ~ a billion
"They only ""dry"" if you let them sit idly, which is surely not what happens.  
Rich people multiply money through investments"
"It's also not just about the liquid value of the money, which many people seem to miss when they go ""well they already have 20 million, why would another 80 make that much of a difference?"".

Money buys you agency over some larger aspects of life. Most regular people understandably dream about having that much agency over the basics in life (living wherever you want without worry, consuming whatever you want without worry, spending time doing whatever you want without worry, etc.), but things *do not* end there, not at all.

At larger scales more money can still cross thresholds. It can be the difference between being able to create your own restaurant (maybe you're a foodie and that's a dream of yours, and that's great) and being able to create your own cancer research institute (haven't seen many footballers do stuff like that, but that's beside the point). Or the difference between funding the education of your extended family, and funding the education of thousands of people through a charity you create.

Essentially people don't think of wealth broadly enough. The common definition is something like 'the total value of your possessions and money', but that's not expansive enough. What wealth actually means, fundamentally, is more like 'the totality of the physical transformations you can perform'* and I'm using ""physical transformations"" there very broadly obviously.

So, if you think of it in those terms, you can see that the difference in millions and billions isn't just about abundance. Sure, to many people, it might only represent greater/more obscene abundance, but ultimately it's more about having the power to transform the world around you.

(*I believe this definition originates from David Deutsch (physicist at Oxford, founder of quantum computation), who uses it to purposefully include why/how knowledge can also be technically counted as a form of wealth: i.e. you're richer than a king in medieval times because you and your surroundings have embedded in them the knowledge of how to perform more useful physical transformations (e.g. showers, central heating, etc.) in more ways than the king's.)"
"Raphinha played in the varzea, basically Brazillian street football, before he got accepted to join pro clubs at a relatively old age.

There's a fascinating interview by him about it during his Leeds days that i remember fondly. Safe to say, he is coming from a less-well background"
"Nonsense. He already is guaranteed a rich life. He makes 12 mil a year for Barça which is 60 mil in total. That is without all the sponsorship and advertising deals, or anything he made before moving to Spain. With his proposed extension that would near the 100 mil mark.

Raphinha is free to do whatever he wants and justify it anyway he likes, but fans just going out of their way to make excuses for these players is weird."
The gap between a luxury and super luxury lifestyle is far smaller than that of non luxury.
"I think he’s talking about players in general, not raphinha"
Are you lacking reading comprehension? The user you‘re replying to is obviously not talking about Raphinha‘s statement lol
"I’m not talking about his statement, I’m talking about people justifying footballers taking the Saudi money by saying it’s generational wealth for them when they already have generational wealth."
It is insulting because marginal utility exists. His grandkids can already spend their entire lives drinking Pina Coladas on beaches if he invests his current earnings. He doesn't need more money for anything. It's just greed. 
"„have real impact on things you care about in the world“


Lmao, yeah, that‘s what Benzema, Ronaldo etc. are doing. Changing the world!


I swear, the lengths fans go to justify the rich getting richer."
"> have a real impact on things you care about in the world

did you actually believe this shit while you were writing it?"
Newcastle fans coming to the defence of Saudi and what it offers is really fun to me
">How can his life change for the better when it comes to money ?

By earning more of it. I know. Surprised pikachu face."
"Everyone wishes they were rich, most of our problems and struggles would go away."
"Use some critical thinking, in no way am I saying that."
Yeah sure but I’m just saying this idea that the money sways everyone isn’t right.
"Exactly and also just the prestige of their profession. No one grows up dreaming of playing in front of 3000 people in the desert. The ones that grow up wanting to be rich, absolutely fair enough, but dreams trump money for many people even the already wealthy."
"by bad translation I was referencing the fact that the words ""in the past"" were said but not shown in the transcript - the part that was translated as ""if I had, in fact, if I had"" should be ""in the past I might have""

The first comment in this thread is someone saying he is already on life changing money so kind of interpreting it the way I did initially by just reading the title, that a guy on Barça money is calling Saudi money life changing"
"of course it is, there are levels to being rich. and Saudi money puts you 5 tiers higher than you were as a ‚regular‘ millionaire."
"> he can already go on private jets, he can already holiday on a yacht, 

well he can instead BUY private jets, BUY yachts, buy all his friends a mansion on the same street, buy a sports club.  
  
Trying to actually pretend like there's no difference in lifestyle is absurd. Are you a teenager? The world isn't just ""poor"" and ""rich"". There are obviously levels to this."
"You are wrong. Some stuff is only available for the ultra ultra rich, it's just the reality of things. Sure, he'd obviously be living in luxury with 10m, but with the Saudi money he can get ambitious, does he want to own a club in the future? Players like Modric and CR7 do, and they can actually buy them off the Saudi money, doubt Raphinha can afford the same off his current salary tbh, and this applies to other stuff, some of them will want a good apartment in a urban capital while others will want mega mansions that could definitely weight down even an elite footballers money if badly invested, etc."
that dinosaur skull is not gonna buy itself
You're being downvoted but you're right. A player could buy a private island instead of holidaying on a private island whenever they want. They could have a fleet of private jets instead of using a private jet whenever they want. Does that meaningfully improve one's quality of life?
"Exactly.

Going from 2 billions a week to 200 billions a week is a huge difference too. How much is enough though ?"
"Don't argue with these people. This sub has an obsession with acting like footballers on that level are not making enough for several lifetimes.

I don't know what caused this brainrot."
"It goes from money for your kids, your kids kids and your kids kids kids. To money for your entire family line for the next 100 years."
"How about his future family? His kids, wife etc or his flose families like parents, relatives...

Messi for example has been known to help out his hometown of Rosario."
"One sets you and your kids up for life.   
Other one sets up you and your family/friends up for life.   
Id love to buy my friends a massive house and any investments into their careers."
"Due to taxes, it would be more like €5.5mil to €100mil, if €2mil/wk is really what the Saudis are offering."
That’s nothing compared to what Saudi may have offered. 5x his salary would net him 30m/year and that’s tax free. He can earn hundred million in 3 years even if he plays one match in one month.
200k a year would be a significant dropoff from his current lifestyle though hence why he would want to make more money. He would have the opportunity to maintain the lifestyle he’s been living for him and his family. Why do you think so many footballers end up working pundit jobs and managing after their career ends? So that they can keep living the lavish lifestyle they did when they were playing.
They are free to get regular jobs like the rest of us when their playing career is over.
That's not my opinion...
"stoning was literally never a punishment for adultery, lashing is  
secondly its never implemented, and if you actually went to ksa or the middle east you will that people literly do everything that the west has.  
but nah its fine, I know you can barely leave your town

if you actually want to attack ksa that attack them for valiable points and real ones,  
\- Yemeni civil war  
\- Khashoggi case"
"signapora too  
Also I'm pretty sure he meant India, Pakistan, burma, srilanka, bangladesh"
Prolly meant India
Saudi stopped public executions a few years back iirc
Saudi doesn't publicly execute people as of 2025
"Really thorough rebuttal... Well done pal.

I'm sure a Saudi prince will be very proud of you and will give you some of the lovely money you're craving"
"I think you're very naiive as to how much €10m is.

He already has enough money for nobody in his blood-line to ever have to work again. His money will make more money each year than most people can dream of.

Say he has €20m in the bank. Even at a relatively conservative 5% real rate of return, he's getting €1m a year in passive income. Got 2 kids? That's €500k a year trust fund for absolutely nothing. Got 5 grandkids? €200k each, ignoring any growth on top or future earnings..

He can already holiday on private islands and mega yachts. He's already got so much money that he can do anything he wants for the rest of his life..."
"And there are also people that don't make what you're earning in their entire working life either, it's all about perspective"
"consider this:

>NFL Players: A 2009 Sports Illustrated article reported that 78% of NFL players face financial stress or bankruptcy within just 2 years of retiring.

>NBA Players: In the NBA, the figure is similarly grim, with around 60% of players going broke within five years of retirement, according to the same report.

Yeah athletes make a lot, but most of them also *special* in the head and waste all of it in no time. Their grandkids won't see shit."
"If you’ve come for poverty and receive so much money that changes your life, your parents, siblings, extended family and you have enough left for your children and grandchildren then why not. Footballers themselves aren’t the issue, it’s the ones paying these wages"
"Idk I mean, if any of us were offered that amount (we obviously won’t be)…. I’m sure most of us would take it! It’s easy to criticize players, but human nature kicks in when you’re the one actually offered that money."
"There certainly are players who just want to live more lavish lives and sell out. However there are some who come from absolutely nothing, and making more money allows them the opportunity to give back even more. Players like Mané who give back to their families and communities. Not every player who goes there is a sell out."
"Be Raphina, grow up in a favela, maybe no water, no electricity...see mom and dad working their asses off. See your friends die or get caught up in a gang. Gets these opportunities through sheer perseverance and a little luck.

It's funny that your world view is most likely that of a usual middle class redditor from a 1st world country. Or even if it isn't the majority of redditors are middle class to be on here (Because who else has the time or energy)

Moreover, imagine your family and your kids never having to struggle from paycheck to paycheck. It's a dream for anyone who has had that life, and given Raphinas religious background, maybe he sees it as a divine gift."
"And this comment us purely based on ""hurr durr they make too much money"" I still can't believe I see these type of comments, every single person in here would take those deals. Are footballers rich? Absolutely, but even the highest paid players such as Messi or Ronaldo before their big money moves to retirement leagues weren't even ""rich"" in comparison. Being in Saudi Ronaldo has made more mone yin a few years than in his whole career and did his lifestyle change? Probably not in a day to day sense but now he's capable of buying a football team, or at least a share of it. Having 200 million in your bank account and have 2 billion is completely different levels in the things he can afford.

Everyone here that makes these comments puts themselves in their shoes, because yeah 100 million would be enough for you so you didn't have to work for the rest of your life and you could sit on reddit and play games all day because you don't need a billion to do that, a hundred million is enough.

However do you really think that these highly competitive players that have a drive to work, achieve like not a single person on this reddit is going to retire at 34-40 and do nothing for the rest of their lives? Majority of them are going to be going into different areas, to keep earning money and keep working because that's the only thing they know, is trying to achieve success, and more and more  and more. Do you think Ronaldo is still playing because he needs the money? It's because he doesn't know what else to do, his brain isn't the same as a normal person's sure money is part of it but I guarantee you that the money is a validation and not the goal. Once he hangs up his boots, he's gonna continue in whatever other direction and try to keep pushing himself to achieve more and that money he made in Saudi is certainly going to help him and achieve more in whatever he wants to do because comparatively to the wealth out there in the world, footballers aren't that rich, they are to you and me."
"How is it selling out? 

Most of these players aren’t from the clubs/cities they play for.  football careers are short. These clubs use them as property/stock  anyway and it’s their career who the heck are you to tell them what to do in their Interest? Football is a business, He is just being honest. 

You need to look up what selling out means. With the exception of Jordan Henderson who made a Public claim of support for the LGBT Community and was a huge hypocrite everyone else is just making business decisions."
"You just explained the rationale yourself. It's the difference between retiring your grandchildren, and retiring their grandchildren."
"Like you wouldn't switch jobs for 400k a week lol? He isn't getting paid to murder puppies or something, just play the same game in a different location for people who have too much money than they know what to do with. Btw it's the same money that Man City and Newcastle are on"
Speak more when YOU are in that position. Until then it's easier to judge and say what you would or wouldn't do.
You vastly underestimate who’s fast a dumbass kid with a fanduel installed on his phone can lose his inheritance
Mike Tyson made over $400 mil in his career and still went broke! You don’t realize how easy it is to spend that kind of money with lack of financial literacy.
"LOL, why not take since it is given? You live one life, they are making the most out of it. They ain't robbing anyone out of their money, it is being handed to them. Of course they will accept. The other guy saying ""Getting paid 400k a week instead of 200k a week is meaningless."" Wtf. How can you be so out of touch of reality and believing in fairy tales. Money is money. One should make out the most of it until they can. Their careers are short, at least gather as much as possible."
"Why you think they spend that amount of money? For instance twitter was sold for 40b how many footballers can buy twitter, Facebook, instagram or any social media platform or big companies? That money they make isn’t that big."
"We as a society 
1) buy energy from saudis for decades, making them rich
2) put professional footballers on the highest pedestal in society when it comes to salary already

And then you find it horrible when the country we buy much of our energy from for decades redirects our money towards the people we watch on TV every week"
"If someone offered you triple your salary (if you consider taxes) to work for a Saudi company, would you not even think about it?"
"I would sell out, i dont care, after your career ends you have low opportunity for income for 50+ years, i would sell out for the highest bidder."
"Thats the thing, theyre already on generational income that change their whole families life. The amount from Saudi is more so money that can enable even more luxuaries and gluttony. Literally. They need to learn fiscal responsibility, rather than stockpile more money.

This is objectively the case so ""life changing"", ""generational"" etc as if the current sums arent already that, is really weird to say and something I see often. Makes me believe that the common man/woman have been brainwashed into thinking that 200k a week isnt enough or something."
How about the incredibly simple reason that I’m greedy lol
You're wrong buddy.
"It's certainly easy to say that when you weren't born in a favela seeing your family scraping for pennies and you get a chance that might only exist for a few years to make enough money to make sure your whole family and their descendants never live in a favela again. 

But yeah you living a cushty life in the UK watching streams all day aren't really in a positiion to understand"
I disagree. I could transform many more lives by quadrupling My income at that scale. 
You need to realize that these footballers aren’t just earning for lifestyle. Earning 5-10+ times what they were previously earning opens up so many more business/investment opportunities for them… not to mention that it’s tax free lol
"You only say that because you are not on 100k a year. Or 400k. Or whatever amount. 
It’s human nature. The exception is the ones that don’t want it."
You end your career at around 35-40 years old. If you wanna live a lavish lifestyle for the rest of your life I 100% get that doubling your wage is considerable
"200,000 a week is €10,000,000 per year. 

A decent yacht costs about that much each year."
I think the difference for some people is generational wealth. It's your kids and your grandkids and their kids you can set up with that kind of money.
"Are you kidding ? There is a huge difference between 100k and 400k, especially if you want to maintain the lifestyle."
Silly take lmao that isn’t true at all
"I mean, the Saudi offers can be absolutely insane. And someone like Raphina wouldn't make 400k, he'd easily get offered more. Mahrez is on a mil a week (according to this site https://www.capology.com/sa/saudi-pro-league/salaries/). 

I agree with you in principle, your life won't change much going from 100 to 400k. But going from 200k to 1 mil a week makes the difference between you living in absurd luxury for the rest of your life and your grandchildrens children getting to do the same."
So are you just dumb or prefer to ignore the truth?
"It depends on the lifestyle you're looking for, do you know the costs of running a yacht, private jet or mansion? Although I think no-one should be spending too much on these things without making passive income, people are different 

Then you have the fact you'll most likely be helping out close relatives/friends, the more you earn the easier it gets or the more people you can help, look at Tevez who apparently helped 15 families.

It's not just about you as an individual, if you have the possibility to make an extra 10M a year just for doing your same job in a different country imagine how many people in your family you could help, how much generational wealth you can build up"
A poster above wrote in excess of probably 10 paragraphs in (quite an elaborate and comprehensive) response. Do you still stand by your first sentence having read said post?
"And you earn more in 1 year than someone else does in 40 years, what's your point?"
Exactly. Seems like a ton till you're actually earning more and realize it isn't. There's levels to it.
What about a person living in extreme poverty in a developing country vs you?
"I completly agree with you bro, when I made that comment I was thinking about Brazil especifically and those ""favelas"" and ""morros"". But ofc all regions are the same, Ronaldo was born in Madeira, Portugal, in a poor neighbourhood, and is just another example of a poor background football player..."
"It's pretty obvious it's 200k per week. Yes the money is ridiculous, but doubling your salary is a big deal, millionaire or not. Most people work for £ so I don't take it personally if someone wants to go to the Saudi or similar for an even bigger life changing amount of money to play in a lower league."
"It's the right answer to give, even if he doesn't want to go there."
"You need to learn a little more then lil bro because he said right after ""its a lot of money and it would helo my family and my wife, and if you dont at least consider this offer (if it doesnt cross your mind) then you are lying""...

Source: native European Portuguese, and before anyone comments, brazilian portuguese is the same shit only differs the accent."
"Yeah, but does it ""change your life"", as he says? Difficult to see how."
Yes and I'm sure a billionaire's life changes once he gets on the list of top 5 richest people in the world instead of being just in top 50. The point is that this statement is ridiculous if it is meant for regular people. No shit an average person would take an opportunity like this because a huge chunk of them doesn't even have the luxury to refuse.
Is it though?
Neymar was paid handsomely per second
"money is just bottled time. just because the numbers get bigger doesn’t change that fact, anybody that goes to saudi guarantees financial security for either multiple generations or perhaps an entire village for a good period of time"
"I mean, they're not getting paid in thirds and fourths."
" it's very easy to lose wealth if you invest poorly. 

footballers arent the most financially literate demographic and they often have a lot of people around them giving bad advice or convincing them to invest in family / friend owned businesses"
"Damiano Tommasi is the best example. Negotiated a fair wage for himself, but donated more than 95% away to schools and lived a modest life for himself. 

Also left everything on the pitch and were a consummate professional."
"> to make excuses

He doesn't need excuses, wtf are you on about? He got offered a bigger pay, why would you have anything against that"
"Nobody is ""making excuses"" for anyone lol, you are making this up in your head. Everything has levels. For us ordinary people, this is a rich life (and don't forget that 40-50% of the figures you list go to taxes), but I am sure that he looks at his circle of other footballers and sees how they buy expensive cars, jewelry, villas, planes, open businesses and make investments, and why should he refuse this if he will have a chance to do the same?"
"A footballer who retires with 5 milion in the bank will 100% end up poor.  
  
These dudes are sometimes supporting over 20, maybe 30 people. All your relatives show up, you know? It's not like in Europe where your family might just be 5 people. In South America, your extended family is family.   
  
So if you make it big, and you had like 5 close friends growing up, now you're kinda supporting those 5 dudes' families too. Like, if your friend's sister's kid needs surgery, you're probably gonna have to help support him."
A worrying amount of upvotes for his comment also lol
"I’m still waiting for a famous player to go change the world. Maybe they’re doing it, investing in building hospitals, schools, funding cancer research… or maybe they’re just chilling by the beach all the time and playing golf"
"He's not wrong lol, to his point for example, money like this is the difference between a player just retiring rich and a player buying his own club

You guys are just assuming he meant charity or something"
"Some people want to, plus I didn't mean a good impact necessarily. Rich people do seem to love political influence these days."
"Not sure how this is defending Saudi, just saying why rich people want more money."
How does it *change his life* though. How many cars can you drive at the same time
"Ahh, so more money=better life, got it, mate. 


You really are the smart one in this thread."
"Then you don't really hate rich people, you're just envious."
What home can somebody not afford on €10m+ a year lol
"I mean, he already plays with Lewandowski, that's very close to that dream already... ;)"
"How is it a huge difference to one's lived experience?

He can already do anything that costs money..."
Who cares about that?
"At 200-250k a week or 13m per year it’s already so much money that his future family will have no issues if invested right. 

If you can fuck up that much money and have it not filter down into generational wealth, then you can fuck up 100m of money just the same."
Yeah rich people are such altruists I really cannot imagine them hoarding wealth for selfish purposes.
I mean sure someone could do that but if they have the chance to avoid that while still having lots of money they probably wont get a regular paying job.
Like you or most people would want to do that
"Mate, only preach what you would practice. There isn't a chance on fucking Earth you would do that once you've hit these heights."
"Apart from Singapore, which didn't even exist back then, since when did the countries you listed (except Myanmar/Burma) belong to South East Asia?"
"Sorry to chime in but 10M may be a lot for normal people like you and me, but not for Raphinha.

Lifestyle creep is a thing. The more you earn the more you spend and it is hard to return to the lifestyle before. Let's say his income is 10M net a year and his expenses are 5M for 15 years, do you really think he can keep the same level of expenses after his retirement for 40 more years? Unless he knows how to invest, I really really doubt it.

Anyway, I don't think any of us know the lifestyle of millionaires, so we cannot judge whether 40M a year instead of 10M would change their lifestyle."
"€10m is a lot but its not fuck you money. Yeah his next gens can live off that, but it’s in no way “generational wealth”"
"$200k-$500k isn’t at a threshold that couldn’t be squandered so it sounds like we agree on that. 

Either way the point is this: if you already had more money than you and your next of kin would ever need and you were offered $300m wouldn’t you consider taking it so that you could use all of that money to help other people? 

Even if you morally object to Saudi policies would you feel a moral obligation to use their money to do good for others?"
"i live in third world, and huge portion of population here won't make a fraction of what some redditors here are earning in their first world jobs,it's ironic really"
Although it's also important to point out that average career is about 4 years or something. You do have some higher profile guys going bankrupt but I'd like to see the same figures on guys who have 10 year careers. Not to mention salaries have probably gone up 2x-3x since 15 years ago.
"Because they have generally very short careers compared to footballers, and one of those groups literally get hit in the head every week for a living.

I’m surprised the number isn’t higher than 78%"
You are comparing guys who aren't the best of the best to guys who are best of the best. Saudi is only going after the best players who already make insane money not guys who are going to make meh money for a few years if they don't go saudi.
"> NFL Players: A 2009 Sports Illustrated article reported that 78% of NFL players face financial stress or bankruptcy within just 2 years of retiring.

> NBA Players: In the NBA, the figure is similarly grim, with around 60% of players going broke within five years of retirement, according to the same report.

That’s their responsibility though. They don’t need more money — they need more sense and better advice. If they had more money would they be less likely to have these financial difficulties later on? It’s not a lack of money that is making them go broke."
So they need to be paid more becuase they're irresponsible with their money?
This isn't the NFL or the NBA we're talking about. You can't compare a dude from the G league who signed a couple 10 day contracts to a guy making 200k+ a week playing soccer
"The thing with the NFL is that the season is like 18 games long, so they obviously don't make outrageous amounts plus their careers are short."
"You can't compare it to the NFL. Average tenure is 3 years.

That's not enough."
"NFL is a terrible example, there’s a lot of 1 and done players and short careers due to injury. Add in the fact that nobody making the NFL or NBA is actually participating in school after like grade 9, and you end up with adult sized children with millions of dollars. Yeah a lot of them have financial troubles, but how much of that is just American pro sports culture? A veterans minimum in the NBA is like 2mil a year, that’s already in the top .1% of wages in the US."
How much is it because to their lifestyle/leeches compared to not enough money made from their career
2009 was 16 years ago.
"Ok so you could pay them a million pounds a week and they’d waste it all, that’s on them. Athletes going broke because they’re terrible at managing their finances isn’t a reason to justify paying them even more money ."
"Professional football is not the same as professional american sports, in those sports there is only one level (except baseball) and there are only at most 2000 nfl jobs a year for players, in professional football that number is easily over 100,000. If you are a player good enough for a first division in your country, then you can keep earning even if your club chooses not to retain you by moving to a worse team or worse division. In the NFL, some players won't play more than 4 years, and the alternative leagues will pay them like middle class earners"
Those stats are including all the bums in those leagues that barely made it and wash out quickly. It’s generally not the raphinha equivalent going bankrupt
If you go bankrupt on 200k a week you'll go bankrupt on 1M a week as the problem is your financial literacy.
"2009 is key here. Today you see some bums in the NBA make more money than the haaland/mbappe. Back in 2009 the money wasn't nearly as crazy for non star players as it is now. 

NFL careers are pretty short. The money can be good but keep in mind that their pay depends on their availability. Also, CTE will make a mf make stupid financial decisions 😅"
"Also all the retired footballers doing random commercials for things like shampoo and betting/crypto sites, I doubt that's just a post-retirement hobby for them"
"""No bro you don't get it they HAVE to be greedy pricks"""
">Are footballers rich? Absolutely, but even the highest paid players such as Messi or Ronaldo before their big money moves to retirement leagues weren't even ""rich"" in comparison.

Lmao they get more in sponsorships than we make in years. They're rich."
"What is the apologism bro? The fact that other footballers (mbappe, vini, kroos) have rejected deals shows its not just a ""normal"" person thing. Fed up with people refusing to recognise certain footballers lack of a moral backbone."
"> And this comment us purely based on ""hurr durr they make too much money"" I still can't believe I see these type of comments, every single person in here would take those deals. 

that's because the vast, vast majority of people here are a couple of months away (if not less) from ruin if the shit hits the fan...they'd be insane not to.

but a dude already earning £250k a week? fuck off."
">And this comment us purely based on ""hurr durr they make too much money"" I still can't believe I see these type of comments, every single person in here would take those deals.

No, also fuck you. Insane to be this self righteous when spouting this level of nonsense. 

>footballers aren't that rich, they are to you and me.

are you serious???? Theyre not rich, unless you compare them to 99.999% of people, then they are. What a useless bunch of bullshit."
"I think another thing that people often forget as they often come from western society and this isn’t a norm for them is that not only is this guys immediate family depending on him but often extended family too. That’s friends, uncles aunts cousins etc. on both sides which sometimes blows up 10s if maybe not close to a hundred people depending on you to survive. You have maybe 10~ years in your career but long after that people still depend on you to survive. For a guy with that kind of pressure it’s stupid to tell him not to take it"
"Big yikes. Closer to the hole, sir!?!?"
The vast majority of people don’t make 100-200k/year. These footballers make that every single week working a lot less hours. The gap is so huge it’s absolutely insane.
"> Having 200 million in your bank account and have 2 billion is completely different levels in the things he can afford.


Nobody can ever convince me that this is true in any meaningful way. Sure he could buy a football team, but what does he get out of that?"
"> And this comment is purely based on ""hurr durr they make too much money"" I still can't believe I see these types of comments, every single person in here would take those deals.

That's not the point, please take the Saudi deal, no one is stopping you but you would be criticized for it, 100% and deservedly so. 

Even Americans earn something close to 120-150k are considered well off and that's yearly. These guys are making that money weekly and that's excluding the 100 different bonuses, sponsorships, image deals and the investments that come with being so rich.  

Stop defending players selling out. No one is saying don't take the Saudi money, please do, but don't turn around and bite back like you are doing and accept the criticism that comes along with it."
If it's a choice between being filthy rich and having all the material possessions I could ever want *and* have football career winning honours with a great club that I can look back on with pride when I'm an old man or just being extra filthy rich and moving to a nothing league and throwing my career and legacy in the bin then I'm pretty confident I'd go with the former. But what do I know?
Lmao they can’t buy twitter so they don’t make that much money??? They’re make more money than 99.99999% of the population. Your logic is insane
"Triple the average Redditor's salary changes their life, triple the average football star's does not."
Not really. It's just that our lizard brains don't know what to that with that addiction. You can overdose on everything but not on greed.
"Yeah bro these guys defos need as much money as possible, no way they can live humbly how else are they gonna buy those tacky clothes and jumbo yachts those are necessities"
"It’s also the famous “entourage” (parasites) pushing them towards chasing money.

People rag on footballers for kicking a ball but at least they do that. You see the gangs around them who don’t look like they could walk up a flight of stairs but get like 2% or whatever"
Yeah totally can't live a lavish lifestyle earning 100-200k a week 💀
"Damn, maybe the lifestyle of buying expensive yachts is the problem?"
"Which shouldn’t be allowed. Because at the extreme levels of that you have money / power so heavily consolidated (look at the US). 

You get to £10m in wealth and you should get a gold star and told well done, you won the game of capitalism, now we’ll tax the rest please."
"And all your mates.

If i was a multi-millionaire id absolutely just pay my closest friends and family to drop it all and live with me on a resort"
"Exactly. I bet the take-home is 5/6x higher when factoring in taxes. 

That's the difference between living rich for the rest of your and kids kids life to living rich for your life and likely kids.

If he breaks his knee at the end of this contract and can't play again, that 5/6x has to go a lot further too."
100 to 400k a week not changing your life is some absolute nonsense lol
"Tio, i'm not taking this from a madrileño"
"Raphinha is from Porto Alegre, a state capital in the south of the country. Out of all states in the country, its three states are among the four with the lowest levels of inequality, as well as being in the seven with the highest HDIs. Surely it's not ideal, but it could be much worse."
"Putting your money in an index fund isn't difficult if you're looking for the lowest risk investment possible. 

It's not a guarantee that your great great great great great grandchildren will be able to enjoy the money you've made either if you go to Saudi, all that money can be lost in 2 hours if your kid is a moron who blows it all on gambling or gets scammed."
"If you can lose 200m, you'll lose 500m or a billion too."
Tbh Vinicius is doing A LOT with his charity in Brazil - which is one reason I actually think he will go to Saudi eventually
">so more money=better life

Not always but most of the time yes. Interesting that you see this as an unpopular opinion."
"Yes my hate is less about the specific individual that ends up rich and more about the system that makes the exacerbated social inequality so present in modern society. 

That doesn't mean if you show up to my house saying ""here's 200 mil bro"" I'd refuse ffs, my values don't deny the reality of how objectively money makes your life easier"
"Not envious as I’m quite happy in life, but having the freedom to not worry about pretty much anything would be nice."
"There's multiple ultra mansions that go for over $100m+ that could easily bankrupt a rich athlete that buys them without good planning, you are also ignoring everything else I wrote.

Let me put it like this: a guy with Raphinha's wealth isn't living in the same mansion as Jay Z and Beyonce"
if you only make that for 5-10 years and that‘s your career done? many.
"I agree with the sentiment fully, but top athletes still receive a salary and aren’t exploiting the work of other people."
"I don't think you have the first idea as to how much €10m a year is, even for a short amount of time.

It is 100% generational wealth..."
"That's sort of the point though... They can squander the €500k and the capital base would be totally fine. The €500k is just passive income that they can fritter away guilt free!

I might do, but if that was my consideration I wouldn't be saying that that money could change *my* life. I would say ""I could do a lot of good with that money"" which I could totally understand"
They're not paying first world rent either
"4 years?!? Is that actually true? never watched the nba so I wouldn't have a clue, but that seems incredibly short?"
"Even so, 200k a week for 4 years is $40m lol"
On top of my head I know about psv player Dams who went to Saudi. He was a very average player and doubt his salary was too top tier. There are probably other players like him who went and are not best of the best.
This applies to a lot of people. What people want and need a very different.
"Dude why are you talking about G league? Have you seen what lower football leagues make? NBA players on average make a shit ton more than first division football players, its not even close.  
  
200k*52 = 10m pounds = 13m usd. The current AVERAGE in the NBA is $12m a year."
"Back in the day, MC Hammer made over 30 million from his music, a few years later he declared bankruptcy with being almost 15 million in debt. Yeah somehow he wasted 45 million in 5-6 years."
Look up how much money Celtics star Antoine Walker made in his career and how fast it disappeared. Sports players don't spend money like regular humans.
"All of them, or 1 out of every 100 retired players?"
What does higher paying job have to do with morals?
I still struggle to see whats morality got to do with anything?: are you refering to the morals of playing in a lower quality league in the middle of nowhere just due to higher pay?

"He is literally wrong tho lol

Players like Modric and CR7 are buying their own clubs for example, that's literally out of reach for most footballers off their normal(already obviously insanely high) salaries. 

There's ""football player rich"" and ""almost a billionaire rich"", and for some reasons dudes are lying to themselves on Reddit pretending there isn't a difference"
"Yeah, these guys are jokers. More wealth than 99% of redditors could dream of, yet no one sees a problem with them chasing more money."
*after your career is over
"As I said, your career ends at a young age. Life is expensive if you’re retiring at 40"
"These people are actually ridiculous. These dudes make in 2 weeks what most wish they could make in 5 years. 

2 weeks."
"Fr, wtf is wrong with ppl in this thread? Acting like these players will be miserable just cause they don't have the latest supercars or having a yacht and they literally have to make as much money as possible"
I don't know how you make that work with footy players getting contracts from Saudi though. Tbh I don't think sports players getting paid a lot is at the top of the totem pole of concern as they're not generally investors and generally seem to spend a lot of their money and put it back into the economy. If Raphinha gets millions that were otherwise being hoarded by the Saudi royals and spends a lot of it in Brazil is that a major issue?
"That's such a bad idea I can't even imagine you really think that. Like how do you think that would even wrok lmao. Yeah ""we're taking your house, your father died and you are not allowed to have anything after him"". No one would have incentive to work or save up for anything."
100k/week is already incredibly life changing though. 400k from 100k is a big change but it’s not that life changing comparatively. You’re making more money than 99.99% of the world population by being at 100k per week.
I don't they know what *tio* means tbh
"Also not really... Unless you're talking the difference between a million and a billion, the amount of money a high profile footballer makes nowadays will be enough to fund a trust until the heat death of the universe so long as the money is managed correctly and there isn't some event like Zimbabwean inflation or the collapse of a country."
">Putting your money in an index fund isn't difficult if you're looking for the lowest risk investment possible. 

But to accept that this is a reasonable investment requires some financial literacy.

Also it's not the lowest risk. There are some more conservative investment possibilities."
Most footballers probably have no idea what that is. Hell most regular people don’t understand how low risk consistent investing works so don’t raphina is logging into charles schwab and buying index funds every week. Come on
"It's interesting that you DO have this opinion lol


And a little sad. Imagine thinking your life will be much better if you had 300 million instead of 100 million."
"I think you're confusing what I'm saying. I'm not saying that it's not possible to spend €100m+, I'm saying that your life doesn't *change*.

Whether you live in a $30m 10 bed mansion or a $300m 50 bed mansion, your life isn't *different*. You're just describing greed"
"Yeah, but who cares, what does that house has that his house don't? They just slapped a bigger number on it and anyone who pays it is stupid."
"I hate what Saudis are doing to football as much as the next person but the people here who don’t understand the difference between say 10m vs 100m is staggering. Part of it is people just assume once a  pro athlete or celebrity becomes “rich” they are all in equal footing with the same buying power. Hence you have people the person youre responding to thinking a 10m salary for 5-6 years could allow you to buy any mansion you want, which is not true."
Only people who only make €50m-€100m over their careers: the true victims of the housing crisis
"Yeah, I dont know how much 10mil a year. But i know how much 10mil is, and multiply that by like 10 years of his career, I can imagine it and im even ignoring the at least 50% tax rate. You want a comfortable life for your next gens, sure. You want them to live like kings/queens,  better keep hustling."
Most guys that are drafted don’t end being very good and are out of the league before too long. That brings down the average. Theres a bunch of 1-3 year careers and then the guys who make it for 10+.
"It's a stat I've heard for years now - hard to find decent information on it since google is now filled with AI slop but assuming the information from [this article](https://weaksideawareness.wordpress.com/2011/11/22/average-nba-career-length-for-players-details/) from 2011 is accurate, then it appears the median career is between 2-3 seasons long while almost a full third are out of the league by the end of year 1. And I'm not sure this would include players who are drafted in the second round and never even make the team afterwards.

Graphed out a [PMF](https://imgur.com/a/Qn27le1) and [CDF](https://imgur.com/a/YMrn6Mz) that helps illustrate it."
There is only one league that pays superstar money to these players and they treat these guys as expendable as much as they can.
"Most guys arent making 200k a week, if your career is 4 years long youre a back up not making nearly that much."
Matteo dams? I think that’s a bit different as he is 21.
"Would having more of it help at all then lol? Who cares if they get paid double they'll just spend double and piss all that away too. 

If their head's on straight they weren't the one who was going to go bankrupt anyway so doubling their salary to an even more insane salary probably also doesn't do much."
"All of the ones doing that, obviously I didn't mean every single one. There's quite a few here in Germany"
You're really comparing being able to eat nice food to owning a football club?
Lol like these players can’t do that already. They already make an insane amount of money
Owning a football club isn't a lifestyle - and if it is you can do that outside of the top 2/3 leagues in Europe.
"I don't see a problem with chasing more money. They can fairly earn it by negotiating a contract and it doesn't affect you. 

Like people chasing higher paying jobs. Wanting more money isn't a crime and doesn't make you a bad person."
99.9% of youd do the same shit
This comment is the definition of crabs in a bucket mentality
"It's not about that, just think about it from the other perspective, why limit yourself to stay in a place earning less only to chase fleeting glory? Is it to feed your never ending ego? Or is it to please fans who don't know you and would also chastise you endlessly if you mess up in the process?

If glory was indeed everything, why wouldn't Rafinha stay in Brazil? I'm sure he already had a salary which made him upper class and could easily manage if he lived a frugal lifestyle. Something to chew on."
"The £10m figure specifically, I believe, comes from Robeyn Ingrid's book on limitarianism: https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/451473/limitarianism-by-robeyns-ingrid/9781802060478

> No one would have incentive to work or save up for anything.

We could debate the feasibility and morality of the idea or the specific limits till we're blue in the face, that's fine, but this (incredibly common) capitalist dogma is so weird to me. Billions of people have lived for hundreds of thousands of years without the possibility of ever having wealth anywhere near £10m and they all (well, almost all I guess) had ""incentive to work"". You think people only create and do things because they wanna become filthy rich while others get trampled over by the machinery that allows them to do so? Why do billionaires still work then, since their incentive to work must have already run out years ago?"
"Then maybe, just maybe people would turn their attention to helping the less able and fortunate vs hoarding wealth. 

If we had a society with no money, just food as currency and someone was hoarding all the food while others starved, there would be revolution very quickly. I don’t see money much differently."
"> No one would have incentive to work or save up for anything.

Yes they would because they will still live full lives."
So all the people working now without a sniff of a chance of getting to 10m are just nonexistent to you?
People in this sub are completely out of touch sometimes
What's sad about that
"It definitely is different, you might call it names, but the difference is obvious. Also I mentioned specific stuff, like buying a club which is out of reach for 99% of rich athletes, you just moved on ignoring it. 

By your logic, I'd argue the amount of money a footballer hoards off his career alone could already be called ""greedy""."
"Maybe it has a pool the size of Raphinha's house. 

But a pool is an obviously futile example, a club in a major league of example, investing on your own brand, etc. there's a lot of stuff that becomes more available and easier the more money you have."
"no? but if you think there‘s no difference, then you either lack imagination or knowledge what is out there that money can buy."
I mean many of those guys come to play in europe anyways. They won't make bank sure but they will have enough money to live comfortably.
"Ah I see, thanks."
What's the average/median for those who end up playing regularly and make it past the 1st or 2nd (if short) contracts?
"Of course but they can do more if they have more money. They can rebuild the entire community that they came from, building new schools, community centers, sports fields, etc."
"At this point we'd start discussing what exactly a ""life style"" means, which is pointless. The ultra rich live a different life style than millionaires, Raphinha doesn't live in the same mansion as Jay Z.

You can just accept that there's no reason to pretend an ungodly amount of money wouldn't make a difference in someone's life, even if they are already rich."
"Not a bad person, but personally I’m pretty tired of seeing individuals on 200k+ saying they need that 400k salary to lock in generational wealth for their great grandkids.

ETA: it’s symptomatic of modern capitalism. No salary is ever large enough. No amount of wealth is ever enough, even for the billionaires."
"On my current wage, hell yeah I would. If I’d already had a long career earning 200k? No chance, cheers."
"Nah, not really. It’s possible to value success and meritocracy and also have a problem with enormous wealth inequality."
"The point I'm making is that the things money can buy you do not ""change your life"" after a certain point. 

Going from a 20 to a 50 bedroom house doesn't change your life. Owning 500 rather than 50 cars doesn't change your life. Having 50 extra diamonds on your Rolex doesn't change your life. Owning the jet you are flying on rather than chartering it doesn't change your life. Etc etc etc"
"Not really sure. You can probably research the numbers and find them. For the NBA if you’re drafted in the first round you sign a deal for two years and then the team has the option to pick up the next two years. After that the top players sign 4-5 year extensions while average players will sometimes sign long deals like that and other times be on 1-2 year deals.

Using the Celtics as an example you have their top 8/9 guys who actually play in the playoff are all on 3-4 year deals and will have 10+ year careers.

Edit: and if you meant salary… it depends a lot and recently changed with the most recent CBA. Before that a lot of the solid starters were making $20 mil a year but now there’s a bigger split between the stars and everyone else. But even if you’re making the league minimum for 10 years that’s plenty to retire on if you’re not an idiot with your money (vet min is roughly a mil a year I think)."
"Yeah i get it. Being fake and greedy is awful and disgusting but i wanted to say that merely wanting more money in itself isn't a bad thing. 

Context decides weather it's bad or not."
"Whatever you earn, there is probably someone who feels about you the way you feel about these 200k+ guys

You might get a bonus and spend it on some rims (because you can), someone looking on might ask themselves what for? Why the excess? Those were perfectly good rims...you have a roof over your head, your kids are safe & secure etc

This person may feel like this because they are in extremely dire straits, to them you're wasting resources, what value could new rims add to your life

Context, I think. As others have pointed out"
You guys are just projecting. When you get a promotion for double your wage remember to tell your boss no.
Why is 200k the endpoint? What’s so special about that figure?
"But this promotes wealth equality, moving money from Saudi to a person from a favela in Brazil that will spend it on other Brazilians."
"my yearly raise also does not fundamentally change my life, i still like having it. so does everyone else. people always like to have more, no matter at which level."

"[According to the Laws of the Game, it should be an indirect free kick, not corner](https://i.ibb.co/dwdsz79Q/image.png)

Does this league have different rules?

Edit: Not sure with all the downvotes when I used the literal Laws of the Game and not just my ass. Not everyone knows every rule change that isn't even in the rulebook."
It’s a new law for 2025 but isn’t applied in all leagues yet
"FIFA introduced a new rule that it should be a corner from now on, not an indirect free kick. The Brazilian league is the first one to have it in effect, they are likely testing the waters with it.

The reasoning (which I agree with) is twofold:

  - The previous rule was too harsh when applied
  - It was rarely applied (likely because it was so harsh)

The new system seems to be working somewhat well so far, we'll see in a few months if the refs continue to enforce it."
It's a new law. It'll be put into action by FIFA starting next season/in the Club World Cup. It's been tested for a while and CBF implemented in this year's league. It happened twice today
Brazil is experimenting with the new law that will be official with IFAB this club world cup.
"FIFA introduced a new rule that it should be a corner from now on, not an indirect free kick. The Brazilian league is the first one to have it in effect, they are likely testing the waters with it.

- It was rarely applied (likely because it was so harsh)

The new system seems to be working somewhat well so far, we'll see in a few months if the refs continue to enforce it."
"The rule change was agreed in March, coming soon worldwide.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cwyg7jyp82do

Sadly, it’ll likely end up the same as most rule changes aimed at improving the game … promising at the start, then the refs stop enforcing it and it joins various other well meaning initiatives that refs just don’t bother to enforce during the game."
"It’s a new rule being implemented in selected championships and leagues.

Brasileirao has this rule and it definitely works out better IMO. A less harsh punishment means the ref can enforce it more easily."
"Nope, just a new rule that will be generally used in the coming months by FIFA"
"Not a bad question. Has always been an indirect free kick, but the law change comes into on July 1st. However, leagues are given the choice to impliment the law changes before July 1 if they so wish. So currently leagues in Canada, Brazil, and select places chose to implement the law change early. Hope this helps :)"
"It's a rule to make the penalty be actualy applied, refs were too afraid to give that penalty here. Now that it's a corner kick it doens't give that big of an advantage and refs don't feel as responsible as before. Refs are not really professional here, kind of a side job thing, so they don't always had the balls to give an indirect free kick just for that

Edit: don't take what i said as truth as well, I'm also not a professional of the field and don't have the balls to say that's actually the truth lol"
"Right now indirect free kicks only used for back passes, by everybody."

Dietmar Hopp literally created Covid.
[just some banter](https://cdn.prod.www.spiegel.de/images/a2641c4b-0001-0004-0000-000001342244_w1200_r1_fpx33.34_fpy50.jpg)
"Oh man what an asshole for supporting his hometown football club with everything he got. 

Yeah u really showed him man."
Next banner sorted out lmao
What a twisted view on football
"Uh yeah is it? Did he broke the rules or laws? No? 
Then tell me how he's an asshole. 

I know WHY you guys hate him, but obviously it's fucking idiotic to blame someone who just useses the system."
you can be an asshole legally
You are part of the problem
"For what exactly? Financially backing up his childhood Club? 

Is that really what makes someone an asshole?"
"I think u guys are. U attack someone like Hopp, instead the System that let Hopp do this actions. 

I don't think backing up ur childhood club is anything wrong, it's maybe something we all wished to do, if we get rich. 

It tells everything, that nobody can't really express why he's asshole or what he personally did wrong."
"and by loopholing around the 50+1 rule, yes."
Pathetic don’t hate the player hate the game bs
"It's not a ""Loophole"". 

Red Bull used a Loophole. 

Hopp just used the system as indeded. 


See u guys don't even know what he did, and u call him a ""Hurensohn"". It's actually crazy."
I mean u still didnt answer he actually did so crazy and wrong.
"of course he used a loophole, they only switched back to 50+1 after they already established themselves in the Bundesliga, before that they were financially doped to get there."
"I didn’t expect that you need the most obvious information. 
He pushed a non league club from a very saturated area to the top tier. There was no fan base. No history. Still nearly no away fans. It hurts the leagues attractiveness and emotionality since they take away one Bundesliga spot a real club have. 
Its an obvious work around of 50+1. 
they are one reason that the 2. Bundesliga has higher matchday attendance than the 1. from time to time. (Of course clubs like heidenheim or kiel play their part but they earned it at least)

Its just such a selfish thing to do and he deserves all the hate he gets"
"**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**
  

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
Excellent shot and save.
Mad save against Super Saiyajin Yamal
Yamal is always so close to scoring. I have a feeling he's one or two seasons away from scoring these regularly
It's honestly kind of infuriating how good Courtois still is. 
Best goalie this year
Curtois still showing why he's a great goalkeeper
"He should've gone to super saiyan 2, rookie mistake"
Amazing jinx lmao 🤣
Spoke too soon
Second Barca goal disagrees
He just did :')
He obviously pressed triangle by accident
Still doesn't change the fact he's been the best Go for the past few years
Ban Rudiger for 10 games.
"This is unreal, is this ref scared or something? Does perez have his family kidnapped?"
Chad Iñigo knew it was offside and decide to clatter Vini
They're just blatantly kicking Olmo over and over lmfao. What do they have to do to get a yellow?
"The fact that the Real Madrid players have the GALL to complay to the referee at half-time should make anyone who roots for this team feel outraged. This is the most successful club of all time, and the players are going in with such a small-club mentality while simultaneously getting the benefit of the doubt constantly.

I don't know about anyone else, but if I were rooting for Real Madrid, I would be demanding hell of a lot better from the players."
"All the pressure put on the ref before the game worked.
He is so biased and allowed many hard fouls unpunished. Wouldnt be surprised if some barca player gets actually injured."
Olmo after being on the receiving end of all those fouls today: ⚰️
Get fucked Madrid. Hate this club and I don’t even follow La Liga much.
**The absolute audacity of these Madrid players to run to the ref after the half-time whistle goes.**
YAMAL BULLIED VINI LMAO😭
How does a grown-ass man get bodied by a literal child lmao
RMTV already prepping footage 🤣🤣🤣
Man I love Kounde
Looks like other La Liga teams need to start harassing referees before their games
VAR didn’t see that shirt pull as well?
That was a fucking pen?
"Honestly what happens in the VAR room in such circumstances 
Do they just all decide to pretend nothing happened?"
Madrid players instantly go crying to the ref at half when they should’ve all been carded crazy
4 Madrid players escaping yellows
and the whole madrid team immidiatelly surronds the ref. Embarassing institution
Madrid complaining like the refs havent been helping them the whole game
The ref is afraid to card the madrid players
This is embarrassing someone please make a montage of these fouls and no cards
the ref pressure worked
anyone else have their ESPN just shit itself. I hate this channel so much
Counter terrorists win
This is what happens when you let Rudiger get away with shit all the time. Such an insufferable cunt.
Will the madrid players get sanctioned for entering the pitch and rudiger attemting to assult the ref with a water bottle?
Pathetic from Rudiger and the rest on the touchline. Absolutely embarrassing
I genuinely want to see what Rudiger would do here? Is he really THAT stupid to physically attack a ref?
Get these whiny shitheads away from my club. I’m so sick of these guys putting more effort into whining than playing to win the fucking game.
Rudiger should have the fucking book thrown at him for that absolutely unbelievable headloss 
"Rudiger should get a lengthy ban for this, right?"
Lamine is going back to the 90s techno scene with that fit.
Raphinha looks like he’s either about to enter the matrix or go play outfield in baseball
Nice touch letting captain Ter Stegen also receive the trophy
Just goes to show that Real Madrids antics outside of the game are having a direct impact to the on-field decisions. Slap to the face is violent conduct and a red 100% of the time.
Real Madrid pre match campaign worked - getting away with murder out there
No yellow for Rudiger is actually criminal there 
"I am so embarrassed for Madrid, true Spanish shame. Despite 2 clear penalties and multiple cards not given, Barca won, this is character 🤩"
Imagine if one of our players threw some shit at a ref🤐
Pedri assisted Lamine who assisted Pedri lol they just let him run in
3 madrid fouls in the same play 1 barcelona foul = 1 yellow for barcelona
"Cubarsi getting his shirt half pulled off, where VAR?"
"LOL he tried to give a penalty, this fucking ref"
All time performance from referee
"Madrid tv had to run a campaign with the guy being incompetent , rather than being barca biased , that is one protest I would join , not just the guy the whole VAR room ."
"What did Ancelotti do to this squad for them to be this much of entitled divas? Mbappé wasn't this far gone at PSG, Rudiger was always crazy but this is another level, Vini wasn't like this when he was younger and more immature."
The next game is gonna be ugly
"Tchouameni with the leg breaking tackle, surprisingly receives a yellow card"
"You can see the biased refereeing , perez did his job"
“Just pulled pack” dude almost took his shirt completely off lmao
Unbelievable refereeing in favour of Real again
Safe to say RMTV earned their paycheck this week lol
Bro where the fuck is var
Half time and three real players are running to the ref to complain lol
We all saw 5-6 Real players immediately go to the ref when he blew the whistle right… just zero shame.
"Not leaving the ref even in the tunnel, fucking embarassing"
Why were Madrid players complaining to the refs at the end of the half?
Wasn’t Mbappe supposed to be injured? Magically cured in half time?
For all the nonsense about Vini and Mbappe not being able to play together Madrid were by far their best when they shared the field tonight
Rudiger crying is better than any trophy
What the fuck is wrong with this entire Real Madrid team - shitty behaviour from top down
"The sorest losers in world football, it’s so easy to despise them. The hatewatch has been sensational today."
"Sore losers, 3 possible pens against you not given and yet you still go at the ref. Rudiger was saved from early yellow as well"
"A couple of kids defeated the best player in the world, Kylian Mbappe and the greatest club in Real Madrid. Truly inspirational."
Bro that ref was itching to give them a penalty haha make it less obvious man
"You know what? This ref genuinely should not been given this game, it's ridiclous

Shouting in Barca players faces when they rightfully complain about a lack of fouls."
Its sooo obvious ref is on madrids side
"Real Madrid TV's dirty tactics actually worked, the fucking referee completely favored them throughout the first half."
The meltdown and referee pressurizing has gone scarily in Madrid’s favour
"This is the most ""karma is a bitch"" game I've ever watched. Real Madrid deserved to lose after all of the fuckery they lobbed at the refs pre-match (who even helped them if anything!)"
"That's a clear penalty too, RM got exactly what they wanted with the nonsense they pulled."
how can they protest about that?
no yellow for rudiger and ceballlos is insane
were these fouls not yellow?
The instant RM surround the ref attempt as he blows for half time lol
"Bellingham while going to the locker room ""everything that's 50/50 going for them""

The audacity

https://streamable.com/e2ls6i"
Honestly wasn't too satisfied with how we ended the half. Giving the ball away too much and trying to force things/speed things up. Just need calm down a bit. Hopefully second half we come in with cooler heads. 
ESPN+ just shit the bed for everyone lol
It sucks how the only one that wasn’t a pen is the one that goes to VAR. 🤦🏻‍♂️
VAR: I was SLEEP but now I’m AWAKE
"I’m not gonna lie, if there is any player on this Madrid team that deserves £30 million a year, it Valverde."
"Jesus I’m actually scared for the referee after this I genuinely think madrid players will try and hurt him, despite him giving them literally everything. Madrid need to be liquidated, horrible club"
"Just ban him already, that's disgraceful."
THE EVIL HAS BEEN DEFEATED
"Deserved Barca win. Wtf is Rüdiger doing, absolutely losing his head."
Raphinha needs to play every match with those shades.
"Fucking bullshit man, Really Madrid cries and cries but they're the most violent coward ass players on the continent"
"Ref was prob castrated before game, literally no balls on him"
Yeah olmo isn't leaving the stadium on his legs 
Bitches running to the referee as soon as the half ends
5 Madrid players running towards the ref wtf
How do Madrid only have 1 yellow card??
First thing Madrid players do after the referee whistled for half time is go to the ref lmao
"The referee is too scared to give out cards to Real, guess it paid off a bit for them so far"
wtf are Madrid players complaining about
"The Real Madrid TV plot is working, ref really did tell himself in the mirror that he wasn't going to card any player in a white kit."
"They’re still mobbing the refs even after the whistle. Players, coaching staff, RMTV - they’re just trying to get refs favour them"
They must have bullied the reffere's kid to be this shite
"2 penalties, a red and around 5 yellow cards saved by Madrid antics.....

This ref is a disgrace to the sport, if you don't have the balls for these games step down."
"So far, madrid players should have gotten 2 more yellow cards and they robbed us off 2 pens.

Idk how madrid fans can complain about refs after this blatant robbery."
"Madrid is playing pure haramball, getting away with crazy fouls and constantly complaining"
"""*You don't need to see this.*"" - ESPN"
"Fucking embarrassing, this Rudiger fella"
"In a real league, rudiger would get like 9 months ban"
"Don't follow Spanish football much but this behavior, seems light years beyond acceptable for ANY top flight team. I mean WOW, Real Madrid really are cartoon villains."
The yamal dance with 2 glasses in his head LMAO
Referee I don't know if it got to him or not but he's been unusually harsh on Barca and lenient on Real Madrid so far.
Olmo’s been genuinely harassed all match
How many fouls are they going to get away with
Second yellow for Rudiger...
How's that not a pen. He's fully pulling him to not let him get to the goal
That's such a clear penalty lmao. He's holding him back.
That was a pen. You can’t just hold down someone on a corner.
Wasn't Cubarsi being dragged down?? VAR??
FUCK THIS REF NO HESITATION FOR MADRID PENALTY BUT IGNORES BARCA HAHAHA
Ceballos really got away with it this half
Red needs to start giving out cards.  He’s lost control of this game.
Pen getting given faster than real madrid paying the ref
Real Madrid‘s media team showed more effort with the ref-video than Ancelotti + all of the players this far
Real has free reign to fucking murder olmo. Ref is off it
When you ran to the ref at half time instead of your coach lol they clearly know who is helping them
"Ref needs more intimidating, the only pen he gave was offside very poor showing from him tbh. Hes been unreliable all game for Madrid, hasnt created many chances been too defensive holding his cards in"
Frustrating to think that this game is done and dusted by now if we have Balde
Ancelotti OD-ing on chewing gum lol
Vinicius is just... unbearable lol 
Why are these pundits not doing a live commentary? No one wants to hear analysis while game is happening.
"Should have been consistent, the VAR. Rudiger’s foul on Ferran was clear and should have been checked too."
VAR appeared in the 100th minute. I thought it wasn't available by the way it was looking.
Should've let Rüdiger run free so he could two foot the ref and geg a months long ban + a nice payday for the ref honestly
"Fuck them, they deserve this"
Lol what does Rudiger think of himself? Show your aggression in the field for fuck sake
Madrid assholes showing their true colours once again after not even trying to hide them.
"Remonada.

Btw, that commentator is biased as fuck, not a foul? Those fouls happen a dime a dozen. Before that Lamine whole lip got blpblpblp and this fucker said it was nothing lmao wtf is that hot take?

Madrid is shameless, they got bailed out by the officials for the stonewall penalties, yet they have the gal to act like they are disadvantaged.

Edit - Hope Rudiger gets a long long vacation for that attack on the ref"
"With all the help from the referee, Madrid still lost."
We got Inter next lads! Hopefully they can get some rest. Long game
Thats a red..
piece of shit team have no football and turn into Getafe
Congrats to Madrid for successfully intimidating this ref since they knew they couldn’t win fairly
Madrid is out for blood because they know they will get away with it because of all those mindgames for 6-year olds. Disgraceful and really frustrating to watch.
Lol they ran straight to the ref at whistle
They are actually throwing objects at the referee... Wow. That is low even for Real Madrid
Ref is giving everything to Real
Another possible penalty
Penalty????
Another pen lmao. This is a fucking joke
"Ref caved in to the Comunicado oficial, that was a clear pen"
AND OFC HE CALLS IT NOW 😭
Bro this referee is beyond biased. How do you give a penalty initially???
So all the fuss about refereeing against Real Madrid was to whitewash any claims of refereeing decisions going unfairly against Barca
"Use the fucking cards, fucking hell!!!"
"Ceballos, Rudiger should yellows at least, tchouameni a red"
There’s gonna be enough tears from RMTV to turn the Sahara desert into an ocean
HOWRE THE MADOGS STILL COMPLAINING TO THE REF.HOLY
"lmaoooo look at those rats run towards the ref at half time ???????? they should've had like 6 yellows already, ref is bailing them out and they're still crying, unbefuckinglievable"
"tchouameni and rudiger are the most disgusting playera on this pitch, this refree is shitting his pants when a big call has to be made"
Looks like they spent the last few days intimating the referee rather than practicing
The referee got permission to officiate the match after he left his balls to the RMTV.
Carlo calls everything a handball lol
Ref where tf is the yellow
What the fuck do I pay ESPN for
Why don’t other teams make the refs cry? Are they stupid?
Sorry guys I'm unplugging things and plugging them in as fast as I can. It's my first day as an ESPN feed coupler!! 
The biggest winner is Inter
"Madrid are offside 24/7, so hilarious"
"That's the team you want to join, Trent...?"
Rudiger will always be a fucking clown
"Inject this in my viens, love when these shits lose"
ref looking like his kid got kidnapped
Least deranged Rüdiger moment
Justice has been served
Rudiger's always managed to skirt the line between being a football hard man and an actual violent person like a true Real center back
"For all the talk about the referee, Real have no right to complain about any of the decisions"
FUCK MADRID AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Football terrorism neutralized... for today at least
Such a big win for us!!
Bruh how does Barca not get a penalty for the corner that hit the post when Ceballos is DRAGGING Cubarsi by his shirt?? VAR didnt even look at that???
Balde against this Vazquez would’ve been tasty
so we gonna ignore that yellow orrrr???
Vini got disarmed by a 17 year old winger..
"Nothing funnier than Jude yelling ""Putaaa"""
there were like 3 fouls before the actual foul and they still complaining
Tchouaméni getting away with murder so far
Why is Rudiger always allowed to do this bs?
Fuck this refs and Madrid dirty bunch
#StopOlmoAbuse
Rudiger keeping that Ramos and Pepe legacy alive
How is that a pen? Tap in denied by a pull back
RMTV did it's job perfectly
Uhh... Yeah. THAT one is def a pen
Fucker gave that immediately hahahah
Lucky as shit with the offside ngl that was a clear penalty
This ref is so scared of madrid
Perez played 4D chess with us lol. The Ref was with them all along.
"Can't blame him, but the ref is just so nervous and erratic. Constantly running around, arguing, never standing his ground to complaining players."
Is Olmo going to survive this game?
How many biased decisions already in this game?
The ref needs to protect Olmo that’s crazy he let them go away with those tackles
"the problem is, you can give madrid every call and they'll still go after you anyways"
How are the Madrid players complaining to the ref after that first half. Could be down to 9 players and 3-0 down.
Not surprised they got away with that foul on cubarsí
Madrid crying to the ref like 90% of calls haven’t gone their way
Wonder how RMTV will spin this somehow to show thet they’re being persecuted in the worst manner ever recorded in human history again
Felt bad for mendy getting injured but after watching this half fuck them all. Feels like they arent even here to play just to try to injure our players
I expected nothing from the refs and still left disappointed
Perez is going to watch this game and start a war with the refs instead of fixing the team
ESPN+ just went out?
ESPN just lost the feed bro
Thats definitely a penalty. wtf
"This was a dive, but where was VAR for Cubarsí and Ferran pens?"
Rudiger’s pen was clear as day. Swept ferran’s legs out from under him. VAR doesn’t do its job.
Hey guys. Here’s a hack for you if you are watching on ESPN: mute the tv no matter which team you support. It’s a great watch when you don’t hear those clowns
"Honestly, most players look dead. Pedri especially is gassed af"
Lewy pls get well ASAP.
"Valverde is equipped with a V8 engine... 

Unbelievable how he just keeps running"
"What a throw by Rudiger btw, can he play right field?"
"This is hilarious 

Real’s breakdown in the last few weeks has been mesmerising"
Let him go. Let's see what he's gonna do to the ref
Rudiger has completely lost it.
Rudi should be banned for few months for this...
"If only y'all put this much effort on the fucking pitch, you fucking idiot manchildren"
What the fuck is wrong with madrid players
Real Madrid 🤝 Threatening the refs
Surely that should be multi match ban
"Throwing something at the ref, will get no ban from the federación"
"If rudiger escapes without a match ban, games gone. I wish so bad he gets a career ending ban"
Sooo satisfying
FUCK THE REF FUCK THEM ALLLLLL
Why is Ruduger still on the pitch
Refs should let aurajo handle Rudiger real quick lol
"Cry me a river madrid, corrupt clowns"
Rudiger is such a prick
Do you think Rudi will get more games ban for throwing bottle at Referee than Lewandowski for scratching his nose?
Make it fun Real. boycott the medal ceremony! Lol
Football was saved today
Why the fuck are they engraving the champions name in Comic Sans lmao
"Well deserved, congrats everybody"
THE SHEER FUCKING AUDACITY TO RUN TO THE REF
"Yellow on Rudiger at least 3 times  
Red on Tchouameni  
Yellow on Ceballos  
3 pens

Great half of football."
Still no yellow for that counter stopping? Is he serious?
Good to know almost snapping someone’s leg in half isn’t a red. No wonder Mbappe almost got away…
"Get fucked RM. You clearly intimidated the ref into calling nothing against your players who know they are going to lose and just want to injure. Your fans, players and club leadership 100% cunts"
12 yellow cards already not given
Only one yellow so far for Madrid is laughable
How can people defend this Madrid team. Bunch of pathetic whiny animals
"Welp, as a neutral.. I think I speak for everyone when I say that was fucking amazing lol proper final "
Rudiger is the type of player where you’ll hear in the news some years after retirement that he went insane and did some crazy shit
Kounde gives Gervinho vibes with that headband.
"Another yellow not given, the fuck is happening?"
Vini how are you losing a duel to a winger mate
Can we talk about that block from Cubarsi though? INSANE
Vinicius has fallen on the ground more times than he has touched the ball.
4 players on Lamine
"Pedri's like Iniesta, doesn't score a lot, but always bangers, and always in a critical game."
That’s a red. Scizzor tackle from behind.
That should be a red.
Fuck touchinmeni
Is being a dirty player a requirement to join Madrid ??
Soo all the crying about the ref beforehand did work
God I hate those fascists
3 fouls lol not stain at all
"Lmao Barcelona got fouled like 3 times in that action and they get a yellow, of course"
I think next time Barça should probably make video compilations of this ref? Quite bad thus far
"**Clear** shoulder by Rüdiger.

No card."
When will this fucker get a yellow?
Give this assassin rudiger a card man hes not here to play football
Rudiger genuinely plays a different sport
Yeah Rudiger could shoot Dani Olmo in the head and he would just get a warning from the ref
fuck rudiger man what a cunt
Penalty bro dude was so held
REF IS COMPROMISED
They actually pressured the ref
"""Not sure how much of a pull back that was."""
Guess you can just yank someone’s shirt now
Does this match have VAR? He almost pulled his shirt clean off.
WTF that's a pull back on cubarsi
"No pen, no yellow, lol"
How is that not a foul be ceballos? He was literally holding Cubarsi who would have scored if he could stretch fully
Another pen not given to Barcelona lol
I’d love to see rm fans defend these ref decisions
Bruh Ceballos is literally dragging Cubarsi back????
Take a peek into the VAR room and everyone's been murdered Aizen style.
Ceballos is so fucking dumb
Its time for BarcaTV to harrass refs too ig
How can you complain about a pen after being offside??? LMAO
ceballos should have been sent off 4 times already lmao
Hahahaha he was really quick to point at the penalty spot now
Madrid and barca have the same amount of yellow cards btw
So no yellow cards for madrid. Interesting
Can Madrid stop crying? Wtf is going on
Ref is atrocious. The pressure from RM working wonders for them
So much referee crowding. Disgraceful.
all that fucking complaining for nothing
"And after half time, Real players are the one to go to complain to referee. Man, they are the biggest club in the world, but this is so lame"
Fouls on Dani Olmo itself should have gotten Madrid players like 3 yellows if it was an unthreatened referee
Madrid players are complaining at the ref? LMAO
"Also, that corner that hit the post, Ceballos literally trying to take off Cubarsi's shirt wasn't looked at?"
Why the fuck are real madrid support staff asking the questions to ref now??
It's hilarious that Vini plays like this but somehow thinks he should get a bigger contract than prime Cristiano.
Real madrid have only 1 shot so far
Need a Gerard Martin screamer
"Thank you, Ferran."
"MVP of this match is Mendy. 

If he didn't get injured, Carlo wouldn't have made early subs."
ESPN just cut out?
Of course ESPN craps out ffs
ESPN stream just shit the bed at the worst time
Did the legit stream break too lol
Stopping the feed for ads wtf
ESPN fucking losing their stream. Worthless lol
Most important time and we lose the feed are you joking lmao
ESPN ad break rn seriously?
WOW even espn+ is robbin the signal and they want us to pay!?!?!
alejandro moreno is a moron. saying yamal hasn't done anything when he's gotten both assist?
ESPN has all of this money just to have the absolute worst broadcasting in the world
"No pen, but where was VAR for Ceballos's and Rudiger's?"
Actual penalties in both haves not given though.
"3 penalties not given, 2 weren't even checked."
This dude on ESPN is a clown
How the hell did they not even look at the one before the Raphinha pen?
"I've never seen a more stonewall penalty in real time, had me completely fooled. 10/10 dive no notes, Greg Louganis would be proud."
"I know the ref is controversial but I like how every time a player lies on the floor he gestures like he's almost desperately saying ""come on man, let me just do my job, what are we doing here, I want to go home"""
This feels like it probably should have just gone straight to penalties. The energy has completely sapped out both sets of players
PARK THE FUCKING BUS
Real Madrid TV are gonna do a hit piece on the linesmen
Rudiger has lost it LMAOOOOO HAHAHAHA
Rudiger needs to go to a psych ward bro jesus.
Ahhhhhh Rudiger head loss. The scummy club of football show their face.
Actually throwing shit at the ref.. generational mind loss.
Please someone admit Rudiger to a hospital
We should all be grateful Rudiger found football instead of serial murder
"VAMOSSSSSSSSSSS

FIRST CDR POST-MESSI TEARS IN MY EYES"
LMAOOO THEYRE CRYINGGGG
"Finally, Rüdiger gets a red card"
You cannot be a player and throw something at the referee. That should be a multi-game ban for sure
CARLO LOOKING AT THE CAMERA LMAOOOOO
Fuck you Madrid
"BAH GAWD, Rüdiger with the ice cubes from the top ropes!"
Sorry but you’re not going to get empathy for losing with everything that happened before the game
Rudiger is awwwful wth was that
Rudiger mad he can’t stomp on the official’s nards.
Such shameful behavior from Real Madrid
I'm just glad that everybody had fun
This is months long ban if Spanish Football has balls
1 of 3 in the bag. 2 more to go. Visca Barca!
was that a bottle thrown at the ref?
What a discussing player is Rudiger
"Rudiger needs to be banned for life, absolute trash player."
Rudiger is such a wanker lmao
rudiger truly embodies true colors of a galactico
"That have to be a lengthy ban, can be normalizing that shitty behavior"
Ferran MVP over Yamal that ran all game and got 2 assists?
What did Rudiger throw?  One match ban I assume.
What a great final
What are they feeding Bernal jesus
VAR not looking at Ceballos taking Cubarsi’s shirt off?
"This is the most disgusting team I've ever seen. All of them, classless pigs."
"Fran Garcia vs Gerard Martin in clasico match for the title.

what a time to be alive"
Bet he won't card Rudiger when the ball goes out of play
Rudiger dodged yellow counter: 1
SHIT REF GIVE A YELLOW ALREADY GO FCK
"Where are the cards, you fucking weasel"
Fuck off. Thats a yellow.
Wow this ref is braindead
"Hey, another clear yellow for Madrid not called."
joke of a ref
Real Madrid TV works. Everybody gotta do that now. Clearly effective to influence the refs.
Pedri best midfielder itw
They've been trying to injure people all day bro wtf
Madrid are thugs
Horrible tackle
"Give them fucking reds for this shit man

They always fucking do this"
"These dirty mf's and they will still have the audacity to cry.
Fuck them all"
Ref is a joke
Ref lost control over the game
Ref's a fucking bitch
Is rmtv doing a documentary now? Ref has been terrible for barca
"Soooo Tchouameni already have a yellow, so no matter what he does now he isn't getting another card right?"
Real Madrid TV'S mafia tactics scared this ref.
Rudiger still not a yellow
Rudiger and tchouameni playing for free
Cubarsi being yanked
No pen for the shirt pulling before the post……
The grab on cubarsi ?😂
lol what was that at the back post?
Clear penalty.
pen all day?
"How in the name of christ is that not a penalty lmao, this sport is such a fucking joke."
RMTV not gonna include that Ceballos shirt pull in the next video?
Cheating cunts
At least one Barcelona player is going to go off injured because of a bad tackle before the ref shows madrid a card
yo??? ceballos slapped yamal???
Really slapped a 17 year old
I hope barca score 6
Lmao this ref
I've never hated RM so much and Vini will never win Ballondor
vini acted like he was shot by a sniper one second and got up like the sniper actually missed the next second
"This is shameless, they compromised the refs. It seems it worked for RM"
Vinicius stopped playing football long time ago
Lol no yellow
Ref has no control of the match
Send vini to the camel league
11 VS 12 and they're winning
What did Olmo do to this ref hahaha
"Considering the amount of time he had, very few players in the world would be capable to score a goal like Pedri’s. Elite teck and composure."
So pissed Trent is going to Madrid. Soulless club
Soooooo will the referee favour Any team that openly criticize the referees for their decision before the game and asks to replace them or does that only work for Madrid?
Some one check in the ref’s family because mans nervous
"I feel bad for the ref, he’s really trying to not give yellows very quickly, but it’s fucking mayham because of it"
"Honestly De Burgos was the best referee in the division.

I don't think he deserves the full blame for this. Clearly what unfolded in the last week has had the desired effect."
From watching the 1st half highlights it might seem like Barca was dominating. That was in fact true.
So a few sec ago when a white shirt did it - it was fine?
F this Madrid clowns
"If Barca lose, it’s on raphina who had two goals right there"
The ref boxed out Pedri there lol
Jude is another player in this second half
"Weak game by Raphinha, and having no proper finisher like Lewandowski is hurting us"
"the card waving thing is so crybaby looking id be too embarrassed to do it

then again id be too embarrased to do half the stuff footballers are shameless about"
ESPN+ is so shit
The only thing worse than the stream cutting out is listening to this fucking moron
"And there goes the ESPN audio, too. Fuckin commercials on ESPN+ lol"
Lmao fuck you guys I don’t even know what to believe in this thread without my stream 😭
An entire team is getting fired at ESPN lmao
No crowd noise is just off putting.
Wait that was a pen
VAR’s going to get involved this time and overturn it after not helping call 2 clear pens
Why didn’t VAR look at the Rudiger one. That was stone wall
Where was VAR the rest of the match??? Lmaoo
"Should have checked that Rudi's play, checked dive."
"Ok right decision here, but how hasn’t var interfered on the Rüdiger foul minutes earlier? Was a clear pen"
"Don't mind that VAR recheck, but where was VAR for the 2 other clear penalties?"
That’s actually quality call. Perfect use of var
this one was not a pen but a foul on ferran was 100 % a pen
Don't watch var for the rudiger pen but sure check out for this one
They didn’t even check VAR on the Cubarsi pull. It’s bullshit
I can't believe Modric is still stabilizing Madrid and terrorizing us in big 2025. Just give it a rest grandpa damn
Valverde has 5 lungs
Camera man had a stroke from the stress
Even the cameraman knew Raphinha had no chance of scoring
Can see how tired Lamine is on his lackluster passing
I know Spain has a late night culture but surely no athlete is at their best at half past midnight 
"🫲😠🫱

Are you not entertained?!?"
Boomer Modric has every right to complain about how lazy the youth has gotten with multiple players not running back to help defend
RMTV with a documentary how they were wronged
"🚨 BREAKING 🚨 

Perez to support Arsene Wenger's offside ideals after learning his player simply don't understand offside traps."
Lmaaaaao rudiger
"Soft call on Mbappe, but Rudiger and Vinicius Jnr are making fools of themselves."
"They went after your family ref, stand on your business"
Real Madrid when literally everything is in their favor and they still lose:
Rudiger is a psychopath those eyes man
Hahahahahah get fucked Rudiger you whiny bitch
Rudiger is genuinely insane
cry babies through & through
oh my god this team is full of CHILDREN
Real Madrid rattled lololol
"Let me lick your tears, Real Madrid"
RUDIGER NEEDS TO GET BANNED MONTHS FOR THIS
Seeing Rudiger in pain gives me great happiness. Fuck that cunt. 
Don Carlo has no handle on that team good lord
"Absolutely pathetic 

Fuck off Real you absolute babies"
Crying about the ref and now crying on the sidelines lol
"Pathetic club, from the players to their media to their fans"
there need to be some hefty sanctions against real madrid for this bullshit
Rüdiger needs to be banned for months. This is unacceptable
"being the most hated cunt in Real Madrid, when your teammate is Courtois is crazy"
Nah La Liga best fine Real Madrid for throwing shit at the Ref.
"Llora Madrid, llora"
Any decent association and that player is banned for a while
wtf is Rudiger doing?
These Madrid players are pathetic
Denying Madrid of any glory for a whole year is way more worth than this Copa Del Ray
Well payed Madrid .. but some of the player antiques from Madrid players are ridiculous ..
Imma subscribe to RMTV now and enjoy their suffering ^^
Good to see the opposing players not be so hostile after the game
Bro is not going to do it 10x
"1. Blatantly pressure field and VAR refs

2.  get no consequences for it

3.  Get benefited by refs during the game

4. ???

5. Profit"
Madrid is a disgusting club. Will always defend Vini against racist fucks and appreciate him for defending others against racism. But this sort of behavior is embarrassing and reprehensible.
Rudiger needs to be gone for a year. You can’t throw things at a referee and then try to fight him. Unhinged behaviour.
LOLL IMAGINE BEING THE MOST CORRUPT TEAM AND STILL LOSING. GOTTA BLAME CARLO AND THE REFS NOW
Thats a red
"Disgusting cunt that is Rudiger, I truly hate him as a player. Should be off already."
How the hell is this not a penalty?
This is getting less funny by the minute now.
Ref is clearly scared
A lengthy ban of 5 non-match days.
"He looks ridiculous, but he’s a kid so he’s allowed to look ridiculous 😭"
Remember how cool Edgar Davids looked?
Because it's Madrid heritage to rob
Literally rm are playing like shit

"He doesn't like Villa, does he?"
Villa have been shockingly poor. Feels like Emery got the lineup all wrong.
"Completely deserved, Villa haven’t shown up"
What a strike. Placed it perfectly
Palace 2025 FA Cup winner we will be there
He actually hates Villa. Usually turned up against them for us too.
Roy hodgson aura caused the goal
Sarr is an absolute baller.
"Power and accuracy

Palace vs forest in the final would be beautiful"
"Mateta missed because he knew it was bangers only today, duh"
"Unreal from Wharton, incredible finish from Sarr"
"Absolute beauty.

Palace have destroyed them in  transition all day"
Cancelled goal into goal one min later into missed pen into goal two mins later lol
Sarr getting his usual goal against us
Palace just want it more
"It's over for villa



Fa cup and champions league gone, they really need to get top6 in the league"
BANGER ALERT
Banger... Should be 4-0
Bangers only.
Great goal it's a beauty
Beautiful fucking kick
Palace have been absolutely class today.
blaming Martinez for the goal lmao
I like palace hope they go on to win the whole thing
Pens are too easy… better score a banger
Emi is having a stinker today
sarr is comically unclinical sometimes and then will pull out a finish like this i love this man
"“fuck villa”
- sarr probably"
Martinez used up all his aura winning the world cup
"""Dibu"" stinker today"
Palace have been great tbh what a finish
not surprised what a goal tho
Palace vs Forrest final would be epic.
"Bloody hell what is with Birmingham teams rocking up at Wembley this season and the players not turning up.
I thought Blues were bad."
Martinez needs to take some skill points out of pens
Love that from Wharton
HAHAHAHAHAH HOLD THAT MARTINEZ YOU KNOB
Greasy Spanish waiter in tatters
Heroes defeat villains
He just like us
We always get bested by Palace since Glasner took over. Played them 4 times this season only drew once
I think getting knocked out by PSG and losing to City last minute took a lot out of the whole team
We all thought it was a head scratcher when he left Mings out of the starting XI
Palace needed the ass beating from newcastle as a wake up call as well 🤝
"Absolutely but you also gotta question Martinez. For supposedly best keeper according to many, you gotta do better."
"He was never the best in consistency, just very clutch for Argentina at the important games."
I swear if City win this will be a travesty
"Or Forest, thats the final everyone wants ha"
"Palace vs Forest FA Cup final would be one of the best in years. The vast majority of the finals in recent years have consisted of Big 6 clubs (no complaints when Liverpool are in them of course lol) and even when a non Big 6 team breaks in they wouldn't exactly be massive underdogs (Leicester 2021)

Palace winning the Cup would be great for the sport and might revitalize the competition. A team that hasn't won anything in its entire history and has been a consistently midtable prem side for over a decade would be an incredible achievement. Despite losing the final, seeing Newcastle win their first trophy in decades was obviously very special but even that wasn't exactly ""football heritage"" since they have one of the best teams in the league, not to mention their owners"
"Best supporters in England, so hope they win it for the scenes"
No matter what 🐢
"I've had a hard on for Sarr ever since he saved our invincibles record back in 19/20.

His hatred for Villa makes me like him even more than I thought I could"
"Palace are one of the few prem teams that consistently show up against City tbf, they've done us many favours over the years"
Dung beetles and other animals that thrive in Birmingham
"I quite like them, TBH. Still supporting Palace here, as they're my local team these days, but I've certainly nothing against Villa."
Palace's press is suffocating
And Newcastle needed one from Villa to shape up.
I think he's great but calling him the best is absolutely a reactionary take from the WC final.
Give it a rest that was a great finish
He’s Senegalese 
"No, Palace."
Marinakis losing the final is a nice vision
don't put the blame on me
"No Villa fans in Birmingham bab. They’re all in Stafford, Worcester and places like that."
"> reactionary

Every time this word is used on /r/soccer, a polar bear dies."
"I think it just gets brought up so much because he got the Yashin trophy 2 years in a row. I think any reasonable person knows, even if he's a good keeper, he's not better than the likes of Alisson and Courtois."
Can we stop pretending he hasn't been fucking awful this season please.
You’re acting like he shot from 2 yards away. Martinez gotta anticipate and adjust for a shoot way outside of 18 yards. Great finish but equally poor from Martinez
Never. You will see him in every goal that Martinez concedes trying to pin it on him.
"Wait what I swear I replied to a comment about Emiliano Martinez, not this one lol"
"Everyone just wants a Forest vs Winner of this semi final.

Viewers will be astronomically lower if City are in it"
Not even in Aston?
"it usually gets used in place of ""knee-jerk"" too, which isn't [what it means](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/reactionary)"
If the shoe fits
"Never said anything about that, we were talking about the goal"
I’m acting like it was a great goal and it would be very harsh to blame any keeper for conceding it
I wouldn’t be talking if we lost to peterborough in our biggest game of the season that’s just me though
Nobody lives there.
It actually doesn't because that's not [what reactionary means](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/reactionary)
And he wasn't great for that either.
"It also means in reaction to, it's not just a political term."
"havent seen much of him this season, I do remember that shit shot from Bernardo Silva that he really should have saved"
"As you can see, it genuinely doesn't mean that someone has simply reacted to something, it gets misused as a synonym for ""knee-jerk"". I was just trying to help you use the word correctly but go and argue with the dictionary if you want, be sure to let them know that you know better, make sure [you let these lot know](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/reactionary#:~:text=reactionary%20in%20British%20English,reactionary) that they're wrong too lol"

right decision tbh
Bro have been eating Rice
Barca and RMA fans are such babies
Proffesional foul. Outside the box. It's a yellow. What's the problem?
"Correct decision, even moreso compared to the Ceballos foul and Valverde handball"
"They get the call and still complain, Real Madrid are unbelievable"
How the fuck is that not a red
Hard to deny that it was a goalscoring opportunity. Probably should be a red for DOGSO.
First call in barca’s favor
Very smart foul there. Should have been red and would have been if he slid in but only pulled him just enough
That’s a red card. WTF.
Més que un amarillo?
"Yeah, great foul tbh"
wrong decision tbh
If it was madrid player 100% a red sadly
Two portions
They both cry wolf while both get so many privileges in and out of La Liga
It's horrible and there are so many of them too lmao
"Its actually embarrassing, surpassing Arsenal and Liverpool when it comes to ref decisions"
The problem is they swarm the ref at '68 instead of prepping for the kick.
"Correct me if im wrong but after the di maria alaba decision in the cl semifinals a few years ago they did make it so that""stützhand"" idk the english version of that term is not a foul anymore, seen this in la liga happening a few times this season too without a penalty shout"
They complain because it's fair to question whether it's a DOGSO.
How the fuck is that a red? Lol not even last person/clear scoring chance
Because it wasn't a clear goal-scoring opportunity with two other defenders closing in on him
why would it be a red?
Because it's not DOGSO.
Three players on him
Because of the rules.
The same way rudiger has no yellow card yet.
2 players covering your never getting a red card there.
He's not th last man. Yellow is the correct call. 
"Had his opportunity to score and didn't, though, which is why it's a yellow."
Why would it be a red?
"> Should have been red

Why?"
Are you blind? He wasn't their last man so clear yellow.
"2 players covering and close to play, so it was the correct decision."
Not even close
"Like mbappe got a 1 match ban for trying to break someones leg? Please, stop lying, stop it"
Are we watching the same game?
"Yup, comparing the TV money of the big 3 with the rest of the league, that alone creates a big gap"
"I think with us it's mostly the fans, and particularly the very online ones. The players don't usually behave like this lol"
"Yeah, in the Netherlands they call it 'steunarm'."
"Which is a fair question, but then given he's got the shot off it by definition can't be *denying* an obvious goal-scoring opportunity. 

I reckon a yellow is perfectly fine here."
"Sure, question it, and then quickly realise and accept there's only one call here and yellow is correct."
You can’t be serious
I do not think you know what this means.
Doesn’t necessarily have to be the last man for it to be a red.
He's through on goal no? That's a denial of a goal scoring opportunity no? Mbappe seems to be ahead of Barca's defenders lol
It literally was a clear goal scoring opportunity
Why wouldn’t it be? Clear great chance to score denied and no pen
No one was stopping his shot which was most likely gonna be a goal what are you talking about lol
What rules exactly
"Players not getting yellows happens all the time, don’t see how that’s relevant"
What? That’s not how that works lol
Because he was being fouled as he shot????
The ref can judge whether a player is through on goal enough to declare DOGSO and with Mbappe's pace there's a good argument he was on a goal scoring opportunity there. De Jong interrupted the full shooting motion too
For Real madrid it should be a red but against real madrid yellow.
It was a fantastic tactical foul tbf
It isn’t neccessarily about being the last man or not
Denied a clear goal scoring opportunity.
"They aren't covering the shot lol, pause it when Mbappe is shooting. Free shot at the goalkeeper on the edge of the box is a clear goalscoring opportunity."
Let's gooooooooooo keep crying bit h
I wish I could have some of that money 😭
Yes they do behave like that
"That’s not the criteria. Your criteria is the four D’s 

distance between the offence and the goal
	•	general direction of the play
	•	likelihood of keeping or gaining control of the ball
	•	location and number of defenders

This is not a red card by any means"
"They can technically argue that the chance could be even more concrete despite getting a shot off. I think at the end of the day, if a foul is a clear DOGSO regardless, the red should be given."
"the call is what it is but he very clearly gets the shot off after getting pulled, ball leaves his feet when his shoulder is like 50cm above ground"
"You're saying that like the players get to watch the replay like us lol

It definitely wasn't DOGSO but I can see why the players might've thought so from an on-field perspective"
"Right, but wasn't a clear scoring chance either with Curbasi there"
How exactly is Mbappe ahead of every defender? Cubarsi covers half of his angle to goal.
"Na, Curbasi would have caught him."
"Can't deny an obvious goal-scoring opportunity if your opponent has the opportunity to score a goal, basically."
"Covering defenders for one.

Unless you want to claim like a million red cards have been missed over the years when someone was fouled as they are about to/mid shot."
"Was he denied a goalscoring opportunity? No, because he got his shot off."
"Yeah - he got his shot off, meaning it can't be denial of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity."
"There were atleast two other Barca players between Mbappe and the goal, it was absolutely no clear goal scoring opportunity.

I know Real fans don't really know the rules and favor putting pressure on the refs instead but please stop posting nonsense atleast."
"That’s not how the rule works. If you are the last man and foul the player with no one near you, you will be sent off.  If there is two players getting back and beyond the foul and close to play there will be no red card.  The presence of the two players meant no red card was ever going to be shown."
3-2 keep crying bit h
Who is crying? Lmao🙃 lettttt go
You started the crying in the first place lmao
Get yourself on the Real Madrid hierarchy!
"Those four criteria come into play when considering whether a situation is DOGSO - but then a situation by definition can't be DOGSO if the opportunity to score a goal was taken, as was the case here."
A shot from there is not an obvious goal scoring opportunity unless the gk is way out of position
"Aye, but then it by definition can't be *denying* a goal-scoring opportunity, because the opportunity was still there and taken."
"I'm just sick of them and both sets of fans right now lol, I was half aiming at the people that have turned this sub into for this game lmao"
"There’s no way cubarsi is getting there before mbappe gets the shot off. I can see why the ref didnt go for the red given how the game is going and because the dogso isn’t that clear, to me it’s a 50/50 call"
">How exactly is Mbappe ahead of every defender? Cubarsi covers half of his angle to goal.

You are right. That's my mistake. But that's a denial of a goal scoring opportunity still"
Don't matter if he was gonna catch him or not. Mbappe has a clear and direct sight of the goal. He even managed to get the shot off as he was being fouled. That's a clear denial of a goal scoring opportunity.
"A free kick? That’s not the same, the vast majority of free kicks don’t end in goals"
Doesn’t matter and there wouldn’t be at all
lol he got fouled in the middle of the shooting motion
Don't think that's in the rules mate
"What if you uppercut him though, it will still be a
Red card even though you said it wasn‘t possible. Checkmate atheists"
That's incredibly incorrect and the two players that are close won't have any impact on the shot
"Yes that’s what RM is complaining about they think it’s DOGSO, which it isn’t based on the criteria I listed. 

He is pushed off balance and scuffs his foot into the ground and then the ball… never in a million years could you say this is “getting a shot off”"
"Still, its fair for the players to question it"
I think it still can be when you look at the extra space that there'd be to dribble into and then get a closer shot off for example.
"that makes zero sense, he can't get a proper shot off because his entire body is off balance because he literally gets fouled, he is quite literally prevented by from taking the shot in a proper fashion by the exact foul that was called"
So why are you arguing? Lol
Sure. I can’t say I 100% know whats the correct call on this one and tbh pretty chaotic all around. Maybe red card and then later pen or two the other way lol
"It's has to be OBVIOUS goal scoring opportunity, not just any goal scoring opportunity."
"Mbappé had his shot, i.e. a goal-scoring opportunity, so the foul can't have been preventing it."
It does and would be.
"I mean, you're free to look them up yourself - [as far as I understand them](https://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules/laws/football-11-11/law-12---fouls-and-misconduct), you quite literally can't be sent off for DOGSO if you're not preventing a goal-scoring opportunity, which de Jong didn't here."
You can’t interpret when Mbappe will shoot if he ran on a couple of yards at least Cubarsi was getting across.  You’re not getting a red card any time players are close to play and beyond where the foul happens.  Also a shot from outside the box is not a clear goal scoring opportunity.
You have no understanding of the rules
"By definition, no it isnt"
"Lots of ifs here, that's not what DOGSO is"
"Think about how many times attackers don't get to take the exact shot they want because a defender is in their space/tackling them/pushing them/blocking them/slides in on them/whatever else - happens a couple times a game at least, especially on corners, right?

They're not DOGSO, because the attacker still gets to have a shot - just not the one they wanted. It's a foul by de Jong, but it's not DOGSO because Mbappé still gets his chance to score."
that's a different guy
He got fouled before then
Yes because by fouling him he is making it a not clear goal scoring opportuntiy which is a denial therefore a red..
Yes if they're close enough to impact the play but in this case they aren't so it's irrelevant. It is a clear goal scoring opportunity if it's a free shot at the goalkeeper..
then explain how I'm wrong citing the rules because you can't and won't!
Its not obvious to the players
Don't think that's in the rules mate
They are close enough to the play as I said two more touches from Mbappe would give Cubarsi enough time to get across.
"> It is a clear goal scoring opportunity if it's a free shot at the goalkeeper..

This sentence right here is why you are completely wrong. Do educate yourself and dont ask people to cite a rule to you that is literally common knowledge."
Other people did. He’s not last man which is basically the first thing that the rules qualify.
It is.. he's denying the clear opportunity by fouling him so just because he kicks the ball as he goes down doesn't mean anything lmao
Yes he clearly isn't taking two more touches so I'm glad you agree with me that Cubarsi isn't going to impact it
"A free shot at the edge of the box within the penalty area D is a clear goal scoring opportunity. Explain to me how that is NOT a clear goal scoring opportunity (you can't).

You say I should educate myself but I can't ask people to educate me by explaining using the laws of the game? Lmao"
You thinking being last man is necessary just shows that you are the one with no understanding of the rules :(
You by definition can't deny a goalscoring opportunity when that opportunity is taken.

Pepe. Never hated a player more in my time watching football. Why does it not surprise me Rudiger would look up to him.
Understandable. Ban should be lifted
> 20/09/2022
Wonder if he will play past 40 like Pepe did too.
Pepe was levels ahead of this moron as a player.
I would be so shy to say this
So who will be Rüdiger's Francisco Casquero?
So when you idolize a cunt you turn into one aswell. Not surprised about his behavior.

"breaking news: the water is wet  
(congrats celtic)"
Most boring league in existance
"Rangers always seem way stronger then Celtic in Europe don´t know how they won this 4. Rangers aka the terror ~~Getafe~~ of Europe is a very dangerous team to meet in Europe in fact not many teams like to play them cause they are just a hardcore team. They even shithoused their way to the Europa league final taking out big teams on the way just 3 seasons ago.

They have developed a bit of reputation in the last 2-3 seasons. I remember that game against Spurs in the league phase this season they were playing a new brand of hardcore football and you could see the Spurs players were intimidated out of the ball and tackles everywhere"
Wow unbelievable
How do Celtics fans rate Brendan Rodgers?
What is worse than a farmer league
"Congrats Celtic, that isn't easy. Trust me, I know."
Legit question why does the winner of the Scottish League not get to play in the EPL? That would be neat.
When did he win the JD Cymru Premier title?!?!?!?!
His agent is on the phone with Total Network Solutions as we speak.
He had a really good season. Great signing for us
But can he do it for Derry City or Sligo Rovers on the other island ?
">They’re now tied with Rangers at 55 league titles 

Strictly speaking, Rangers have 54…"
rangers and their tribute act*
"I think kolo toure still holds the best record.  2 invincible seasons,  arsenal and celtic"
He's on the wing
Everytime he's on the ball they know there's gonna be a goal and he's their superstar from Portugal
"Had some great moments, but think he needs a proper pre-season to get back up to speed."
We were playing some great stuff until Europe was done and we had the heavy lead in the league.
">The football has been dire at times 

There's a solid chance this will be our highest scoring league season in history, just shows you how high the standards are."
"It’s quite remarkable that Celtic caught up if you look at the league tallies circa 2000. Could have easily won the league in 03, 05 and 11 too and dominated even more. "
scary how far from the truth this comment is and how many people agree with you.
Next Faroese?
"We play attacking, progressive football and our players are signed with that purpose. It means that when we come to Europe (especially under Ange) we can be very naive.

Rangers for the past few years have been more pragmatic and it’s helped them in Europe but hurt domestically.

I’d argue though that this season, we’ve shown an ability to mix it up and had a pretty good campaign, narrowly missing out in the knockout vs Bayern in the last minute. Hopefully next season is some more progression."
"They're built to play without the ball, we're built to play with it. Means when we try to go toe to toe with teams in Europe with 10x the budget, we get scudded.

Big improvement this year though."
Celtic play UCL while rangers have Europa league. Plus Celtic has won the European cup. They are on the verge of being the best Scottish team by all metrics
Rangers are shit whenever they're not playing on a Thursday night
"Celtic just have a stronger squad and have done comfortably for a decade now. The stronger squad always wins the league. Rangers aren't even a good cup team contrary to Europe, they've only won 2 trophies in the last decade and one of them was the league. They've just got European juju for some reason."
Last time rangers played in the CL they were the worst  team in the competitions history 
Don't think fans of a basketball team would know much about Rodgers
"He's quite obviously a step above everyone else in the league, he sets a standard and style which is domestically very effective and he improves players abilities/mentality to suit that effective style.

He's also an arrogant narcicist with a poor transfer record who believes he deserves to be mixing with the football elite and has a general football philosophy heavily influenced by that elite which means we'll continue to dominate domestically but not do anything particularly interesting in Europe and he will ultimately leave behind him a squad in a worse state than he inherited."
"2nd best manager in modern Celtic history behind MON, and if he extends and continues to achieve with us, has the potential to go ahead for me"
Bit of a downgrade in quality and style of play from Ange. Players who were immense and out of this world like Kyogo and CCV played less like world beaters after he came in but he's still kept the team tight and playing well. Good results in Europe this year were refreshing too. We gave Bayern a run for their money despite Kompany fumbling that club.
I love Brendan
Don't really want to see Celtic play in an overcommercialised super league
Because they're Scottish. Which has zero overlap with English football (Berwick Rangers aside).
"""Aberystwyth Calling"""

One of the best shot stoppers I've ever seen live. Some of the saves I've seen that man do are extraordinary.
Seems that signing ex-Man City keepers looking for one last hurrah has been a success in general up there!
Rangers Died
Celtic have won the 13 of the last 14 leagues.
How about in the world of Schmeichel?
And Paulo Bernardo? Really thought this was going to be his season
The European performance where fantastic this season but sometimes in the league the football was dire
"Or the quality of the SPFL?

Or maybe just that your performances are inconsistent, given that it's your best season in Europe for a while..."
"Sine 2000, Celtic have won about 19 titles. The 90s aside, Celtic have dominated Scottish football since the 60s. Infact, you’d need to be in your 70s or 80s for Celtic not to have dominated in your lifetime, it’s unprecedented"
"I think the change in format for the European competitions has helped, more matches and fewer of those matches are dead rubbers with no effect on the outcomes for either teams. Celtic are now getting regular experience playing teams with more resources, rather than just being thrown in at the deep end a couple of times a season."
We already are? We have the most trophies by 2 and that's without going into how rangers won many of theirs...
He really screwed us in Orlando last night
He's better than ange. Ange spent a shit load to get celtic playing that way and rodgers is onto his 4th treble in 4 full seasons
"I don't think ange gets the results brendy got in Europe. It's the one big red mark on anges celtic CV (that and playing scott bain vs hibs and giving Lee Johnson a win over celtic).


Those two results and performances against bodo glint were a real hard one to take. They did to celtic what ange wanted to do to them"
Rodgers is leagues above Ange.
"Thanks for responding instead of downvoting. Idk these kinds of opinions, and was genuinely asking"
Could say the same about Scotland
we love him
It's not just the quality they bring in between the sticks. The experience and leadership i think they bring from prem and national teams is important
"I don't get what the point of the ""Rangers Died"" narrative is for a Celtic fan. Guessing it just a wind-up, most don't seem like the type of fans to think titles should be attached to LLCs and C-corps rather than fanbases."
"He started the season well, and showed a lot of maturity covering the DM role when McGregor was out injured around October. 

The experience of going from a more attacking role to dropping back into the holding role really helped O'Riley grow as a player a couple of seasons ago when he had to cover for McGregor in the same way - I think it says a lot about Rodgers opinion of Bernardo that he was trusted in that role over the other midfielders and I think exercising that versatility at this stage of his career will pay dividends for him long-term.

His own injury came at a bad time as it's now a bit too late for him to get back up to speed and claim a starting spot. There's only 5 games left including the cup final and I don't see Rodgers moving away from the settled midfield 3, at least not for the final. 

Hatate is likely to be away in the summer, so that 3rd midfield position alongside McGregor and Engels will become his to lose. He'll have tough competition in McCowan and whoever we bring in to replace Hatate, mind you.

If you can't tell, I'm a big fan of his haha. I hope he'll kick on next season."
Just brush off a decade there like nothing ever happened
"What I mean was Celtic have more Scottish cups and UCLs, but rangers used to have more league titles, now they don't"
Recency bias. Tottenham are shit bias.
"You can see he loves playing for Celtic especially on CL nights at Parkhead

He’s absolutely beaming during YNWA. 

Great spot for him really. Doesn’t have anything to prove but still competing against top level teams in the CL. He can just enjoy it"
Does it need to be anything more than a windup?
"The main gripe Celtic fans make is that Rangers distance themselves from the debts racked up by the old company's wilful and negligent spending and argue they shouldn't face the consequences of it as a different company, but get to keep the trophies won from all that spending as a club"
">I don’t get what the lot of the “Rangers died” narrative is for a Celtic fan. 

Well the club went bust and went out of business. Why wouldn’t we make fun of our biggest rivals for going bust and out business? 😂"
Funny innit
"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/16/arkadag-turkmenistan-al-hilal-world-record-football

Worth a read for anyone who likes world football."
Turkmenistan isn't real.
Fair enough
"That's the default in Greece by the way, clubs go bankrupt, get relegated to a lower division, form a new ""company"" and erase the debts while keeping the history. 

AEK, Aris, Panionios, Iraklis and many other smaller clubs have done it.

I'm pretty sure some clubs in Italy have done something similar."
I thought it was just a wind up though? You’re not serious about it are you?
Well fair enough then if that's the why they do it in Greece then it can't be financially irresponsible
They were liquidated. Deid.
Serious about what? Obviously seeing as most Celtic fans hate this Rangers as much as the last one means they accept continuity but they still have decent points as to why they were allowed to do it. Do you think a club can spiral into debt and then just shrug it off with a new company and start again?
"From a fans perspective? Yes 100%. Fans shouldn't be punished from poor managment, and shouldn't have to shoulder a burden of the history of that poor managment."
"""It's not irresponsible, it's just avoiding responsibility to the people that are owed money"""
">Fans shouldn’t be punished from poor managements and shouldn’t have to shoulder a burden of the history of that poor management 

Rangers fans actively cheered on the CEO (David Murray) who piled up the debt because, and I quote: 

*“For every five pounds Celtic spend, we will spend ten”*

Of course, they also cheered when he sold the club to Craig Whyte for £1 because they believed media reports that Craig Whyte had “wealth off the radar” (cough he didn’t really have wealth off the radar cough). 


&nbsp; 

Rangers fans should always be reminded that they cheered along happily while Davey Murray racked up the debts that killed their club  😂"

It’s murder. Villa were so off it today.
Eddie absolutely mugged off Tielemans there
"Horrific passing from Villa again.

Tielemans having a shocker. Barkley been poor since he came in too - can’t believe he took McGinn off when he was probably the best player"
HELP WHY DOES HE HATE VILLA SO MUCH
>It's three and it's Palace!
Really nice of Villa to put their 15/16 team out every time they play Palace
Season unravelled in 11 days 😬
Eagles will win it all. mark my words
LETS FUCKUNG GOOOO. He hates Villa LMAO
"Nketiah mugged him, great assist."
Villa have been tragic. Well deserved.
Tielemans needs to watch that one player POV video to see how little time you have on the ball…
So good to see a defender flopping to the ground under minimal pressure not getting the cheap free kick.
Get ready for PSR Villans
Villa have been so weak
"Goddamn he's one tonight, but Villa just haven't shown up"
Aston Villa just don't have the mentality. Crumbled so badly.
Yippee I Aye ya fucken piss weasels 😂😂😂😂
Tielemans caught out again
The turn around of Palace’s season has been remarkable. Glasner deserves more praise.
Eze and and Ismaila Sarr   tearing your defense apart 🎵🎵
He really does hate Villa
"so happy for them, now go get that thing!"
"Pretty weak stuff from Tielemans, maybe should’ve had a shout from a teammate though"
Unais name was getting sung as the second best manager last month… crazy what a couple of weeks will do to you
Superb from Palace. Hope they win it.
The speed of the man to run onto that!
"Oh Tubby, not quite the same as the last time you were at Wembley"
"""Best keeper in the world"" lol"
"“One team on their game today... the other, very off colour”"
Aston villa are shit
"Imagine losing a game 3-0 where Sarr scored a brace, frauds smh"
Fuck Marty Cash
"It's palace. Regardless of the cope you'll get from some Villa fans about it, Glasner well and truly has our number.

4 losses, 1 draw and something like 16-4 in GA and GF."
Let’s credit Palace. They’ve been immense. Villa were alright apart from maybe Martinez
Say whatever you want about Eddie but he knows how to create goals from pressing. Scored/assired more than a couple goals for us doing things like this
"> Eddie absolutely mugged off Tielemans there

Palace fan, but it was insane the ref didn't call this a foul but blew up at Mateta and disallowed the goal earlier."
Emery seems to have made some strange subs in the past few games
A six-fingered Villa fan killed his father when he was a child
Looking like the most in-form team in the league to getting bumped out of every competition in a matter of days
Would be fantastic… unless forest knocked out city then I’d be fine with anyone winning
And huge credit to Nketiah for winning the ball and nice early pass
"Did they ""not show up"" the last 4 times Glasner bested them or can we actually admit we know how to beat them?"
Shit defense
Imagine losing to Plymouth Argyle in the 4th Round. Off you fuck.
What do you have against the guy 😭
"More of a foul than the mateta one. Very surprised watching the highlights.

If you showed me those two clips and told me one of them was given a goal, my guess wouldn't have been Sarr's"
"Did the exact same against PSG with Rashford and McGinn off, usually he’s spot on but lately has been odd"
I will never get over Rashford and McGinn being subbed off against PSG.
">six-fingered

Redundant when you're referring to villa fans"

I find this funny tbh 😂
"They wouldn't dare, would they?"
Is it happening
Its ze history of the Hamburg
"You're 16th mate

Edit: 17th lol

Edit 2: West ham are shite"
"But 5th, then 16th, is not good no matter how you look at it

Edit: I feel like, for a club with the resources that Spurs have, 5th/6th should be the bare minimum for what is considered an ok season"
Ange still trying to live off the purple patch when he first signed. Rather than the year and a half after he'd been figured out.
"""And who has a better story than Ange The Broken..."""
He is really not doing any favours for himself talking so much. He's turning into that weird uncle at family reunions who just 'says it how it is'.
"I mean the excitement for 5th place is because it’s an extra CL spot this year. 

It wasn’t last year Ange, which is why nobody was bothered. 

Well done on qualifying for the Europa I guess? Is that what he wanted?"
"Another Ange Postecoglou press conference, another 'No way he's serious' quote. Finishing 5th last year was a good story, but it was a good story *last year*. This season has been a disaster. Talking about 'premediated outcomes' just makes him sound like a paranoid loon who thinks everyone has always been out to get him. If Spurs were 8th and in the semi-finals of the Europa League he would be getting praised for managing their injury crisis and being on the brink of winning a trophy. 

I just can't believe there are still people who think this guy is good at handling the media."
Ans i thought pep was depressing this year
ANGE YOU ARE 17TH! Nobody is out to get you; you're just absolutely shite
Bragging about fifth place?
Premediated? Big man youre 16th and spent a fortune lmao
"Kinda respect how Amorin handles the situation he's in tbh, compared to this.

He's like ""We are not the best rn and we will work on being better"" and shrugs it off. I guess being only a couple years removed from being a player himself gives him that mentality. Arteta was similar during his first year."
Christ he's annoying
Aren't they 17th? Come on mate.
That's his narrative. Another one is that we have been falling since the latter part of last season and haven't shown much in terms of progress
"This guy always has an excuse at the ready and constantly fighting with the media. Tbf it comes across as “woe is me” and weak. 

Give him an extension Spurs! "
"And where are you finishing this year, mate?

Once you start yapping like this, you know you're on borrowed time. The only question is whether Levy does it a week before Spurs get to a final or after they bottle it."
"Man has mentally checked out,  he’s just hanging on for that sweet sweet severance bag"
Friendly reminder that Ange has won 23 of the last 61 PL games
"In what world is it hysteria?

This is a team that narrowly missed out on Champions League football last season, that has had a whole new heap of money spent on it and that is now sat 16th in the league and have lost more than half of their games.

Like... is that not some how justified?"
"Of course team dropping from 5th to 17th is a better story you muppet. 

Everyone are wondering how did that happen"
Everyday he weaves a new turd in his vast tapestry of bullshit.
"I’m with Ange, fucking media bullshit juicing up what has been a great season."
It’s not premeditated for a certain outcome. It’s an obvious reaction to the actual outcome Ange facilitated.
Remember when the media thought he was likeable because he was won a few games and said mate a lot?
You’re managing spurs mate. Disaster is premeditated.
is it *premediated* or *premeditated*?
He’s fallen right into the media’s hands.
This man is going down fighting and I love it.
"Well you’ve been in charge 2 seasons, and at least half of that time (probably longer if you include their capitulation back half of last season) HAS been a disaster so…

And I know Spurs had lots of injury issues but still - if they’d had those injuries and were 10-13th you’d go “fair enough they were hit hard for a while and it wrecked their season.” But to only be above West Ham and the three truly dire promoted sides is pitiful with the amount they’ve spent"
I can’t believe after the season spurs have had his claim to always win a trophy in his second season could still come true
Honesty will be hilarious if Spurs end up winning the EL this season after all this
"Levy, just be kind and pay him off. It's just cruel at this point."
"Fans been slagging off their own squad for over a year, 

you reap what you sow"
That was last year’s story; that’s why it’s a bad story today. Your tenure has been a disaster!
You're one spot above relegation ffs
">We finished fifth last year

And you're definitely not finishing fifth this year. 

The only redemption Ange could possibly have now is going on to win the Europa league."
Do yourself a favour Ange and stop talking
Carefully ignoring the end of last season I see. 
Shutup mate
"Came 5th last year, fait point but you're now 16th ffs"
"Honestly, shut the fuck up lmao"
"It seems like the go to excuse for incompetence in today's world is vague conspiracies. From politicians to football managers, if you're shite at your job just blame some vague cabal of orchestrating things from the very beginning.

Surely all this criticism couldn't possibly be because you're 16th mate?"
"They are going to finish 5th again, just from the bottom this year."
"Mate is begging for that ""certain outcome"" every single time he speaks"
You talk too much
"I, for one, have been enjoying his interviews as of late. It's clear he's also feeling done and is just speaking his mind now because he knows he'll be let go. I'm just waiting to see what he says next."
"Extremely weird negativity towards Ange on Reddit, whenever he opens his month. Given the shit he’s had to deal with, not to mention a historic injury crisis, I’m totally fine with him defending himself. 

There’s every chance we could have ‘adapted’ and ‘been pragmatic’ and the injuries wouldn’t have led us to suffer as much in terms of results. But his whole thing is to get the players to believe in something that requires a lot of bravery, and giving up on those principles would stop the progress to that over the long term. If the players decide they don’t have to be brave under pressure, the whole thing falls apart. But if we can get our best players and our spine playing consistently playing the football he can, we may be able to outperform bigger spenders long term. 

Anyway it’s all a moot point now. He’s probably gone. But I don’t kind him at all defending himself. He’s shown a ridiculous amount of disrespect and has had to deal with crazy injuries outside of his control."
He's lost the plot.
Embarrassing behavior from this guy. Mask has completely fallen off.
"Dude, STFU, this isn't the stunning argument you think it is."
This just tells me he’s a narcissist.
"Excuse me, what? 

Yeah no, 16th is beyond ridiculous. (And I should really check the table every now and then)"
“It’s who we are mate…..”
"Bingo. For us finishing anywhere between 4th-7th is the minimum for a acceptable season. Then you add cup runs and Europe on top of that.

Dropping from 5th to 16th as you said is just not good no matter how you spin it. If he somehow wins us the EL it will be nice in a vacuum but also just paper over the abysmal league campaign."
If I speak I'm in big trouble (Utd fan)
"It’s competitive now, 7th or 8th are less shameful than they were a decade ago. You can easily put 6 or 7 very good and equally/better resourced sides above them."
Despite the insane spending over the last few years the standards at the club have fallen much lower than what they were just 5-10 years ago.
Most profitable football club in the world aren’t they?
"Par is 6-7th for Spurs if you look at current resources. But that has potential to rise in the coming years, unless there is a big change to the financial rules, which doesn’t look as unlikely as it did just a year ago. 

Spurs should be way higher than 16th, but 7th would have been near impossible given the injuries this season."
"Still find it insane that he never tried to adapt after that run of games. Find it even weirder that he got so much praise for stubbornly sticking to his guns, even though they clearly weren't working anymore.

His unwillingness to actually adapt his tactics and methods to a new league will always remain one of the most baffling things about him. 

It's like he saw exactly what was going wrong and just said ""Yeah, well, I like this way of playing so come what may, I'll just stick with that""."
"This is part of why I don’t get too worried about the Conte’s, Slots, etc.

Don’t get me wrong, Slot has had an excellent year. It’s a whole different thing building year on year though. Good managers get a lot out of their team when they arrive. Great ones get more and more out of them as time goes on. 

I’m pretty interested to see what happens with Liverpool next year. I could see them getting much better with some signings or ending up relatively far off the pace."
"This gave me a proper laugh, not gonna lie I’m shamelessly stealing that and using it as though I came up with it in a few group chats"
It's amazing that he thinks he is being targetted when in fact he has probably been given the softest treatment by the English media for a guy of his pedigree who has quite frankly landed a bigger job than his CV justifies. The journos and ex player pundits were much harsher with Ten Hag last season and even Amorim this year. Ange's struggles have gone under the radar and until recently the injury crisis he had to deal with sort of softened the narrative around Spurs.
Well it’s a press conference… he’s literally there to talk and answer questions
"If you're going to come out with stuff about how you ""always win a trophy"" in your second season, you can't then start crying when people criticise your team for being 16th."
"It’s cringe af to hear grown men talk this way. 

I went from loving him to rolling my eyes every time he whines about some new crap."
I'm pretty amazed that there aren't any stories coming out about the players disliking him.
100% confirmed Aussie then
"Big part me of thinks he is just doing a Conte and trying to get himself fired now by saying wild and/or exaggerated stuff in the media. He knows the writing is on the wall.

They could win the Europa league final 5-0 and people would still be doubting him at this stage so might as well take the payoff and move on."
I still remember Ange's quotes were posted here every other day and everyone was saying how nice and grounded he was. It's obvious now that it was just a public personality he was trying to build. It's hard to assume that personality now when you are stressed out. 
Most insufferable character in football at the moment
"Finishing 5th last year *wasn't* a good story. Being 1st in October was a great story. Being in the title chase in November was a good story.

Falling from that incredible start to clinging on to a Europa League spot is just another Spurs story."
There are still people in our sub defending the man. I was Ange in until around December before realizing he was just going to accept the public stoning every week and do fuck all to change anything.
Finishing fifth with Tottenham is my greatest achievement.
Having bottled overtaking us despite winning at Villa Park while we limped towards the end of the season
Who does that? Bragging while not winning anything.
"And this is kinda what he’s eluding to. For Villa, Newcastle, Forest, that position this season has been ‘outstanding’ and lauded… but if it were Tottenham it’s ‘pfft bragging about 5th place’"
We’ll see how he’s talking at the tail end of *next* season. He’s still in his “free hit” time period.
"In fairness they had injuries this season. I'm the first to shit on Spurs but like we narrowly missed out on the title last season and are well off pace when we should be pushing on precisely because of injuries. In context we should be doing much worse, and if we had we would be moaning a lot more about injuries. 

Just talking about being 16th gives Ange an easy out. We should instead be talking about Spurs form not being any better in the 2nd half of last season. In 28 PL games after the purple patch he had 12 wins. Not very dissimilar to having 11 in 33 this season. They are shit with or without injuries that is the message"
"The ""injury crisis"", at least for the two starting CBs, was completely self inflicted because he's a garbage, amateurish Manager whose only past coaching experience was in Australia & Japan."
"No, they're 16th."
If spurs reach the EL final they should sack Ange before that in classic Levy style.
The calls to get rid of ange didn't really intensify until he cupped his hand to the away support either.
"i'm not trying to start shit. But are you really a top 4 club given how crazy these other teams are? we are talking Villa / newcastle / Chelsea? And now Forrest?

Like even for us, we could have easily slipped to top 4 or maybe even below with our awful injuries. 

Maybe top 4 would be realistic if your current squad is under a manager who's not a one trick pony and can get them to punch above their weight?"
Especially when you see the level of the sides. Like wolves were in relegation territory for a while with 3 brazil internationals
"With Newcastle's resurgence there are 5 teams that are easily better right now - Liverpool, City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Newcastle. Spurs should be fighting ManU for the 5th-6th spots, but both are shitting the bed badly. If we take teams like Villa and the occasional overachievers like Forest into the equation, the above 5 are fighting for the 4-5 CL spots and another 4 fighting for the rest of the EL/Conference ones, so finishing 7th-8th shouldn't be such a bad indictment, but certainly the minimum for them."
thought that was Real
"Weirdly, we actually have adapted in a few games this season. 

Man City away, Brentford away and Frankfurt away are the ones I remember. We play well, and get the results.

Then the next game we go back to the default Ange tactics and put in a run of losses."
Problem is it’s not even baffling. When he joined he explicitly said from the outset he came here to play a certain way and he under no circumstances will change that. At the time I thought it was exactly what Conte used to say when he was here just in an Australian accent. It was a tragedy waiting to happen.
He hasn't hired the calibre of coaches that could help him play another way. They're all young and or inexperienced at the highest levels.
hell the BBC contingent were giggling like school children asking ETH about getting sacked right after he had won the FA cup.
Reeks of imposter syndrome
"Exactly. Imagine Klopp or pep doing this. The scrutiny would be insane. 

He’s being babied comparatively. 

I enjoy it tho. This is a fanbase that roots for their own team to lose. So they have nothing to complain about."
He can show up and give the most bland answers and make the football talk. He has an obligation to show up not to talk whatever he's been saying last couple of months.
"There's a difference between answering the questions and this, just give the same auld shitty pr talk and you won't have 19 clubs fans taking the piss and the Spurs themselves hating you. 

For someone who prized himself on not caring for the media and all that he sure does care a lot."
"Yes, but he's being willfully ignorant. Get 26/30 in your first 10 games then finishing 5th, due to midtable form, is not going to get a lot of praise. And the prize for 5th is very different now"
"I don't find him insufferable. ETH with his infinite excuses, ""anyone but me"" was worse.

Ange's victim complex is just tiresome, and honestly, a bit sad."
Seems you’re a little obsessed buddy
"Nah, their form obviously tailed off dramatically last season, but jumping up from 8th to 5th without Harry Kane was a good story for Spurs. They never had any chance of winning the league and a Champions League spot was always unlikely too."
"Well Spurs are expected to be up there, having been there most of the past 20 years."
"Like it or not, Spurs are considered bigger than those clubs."
"Slight bit more context around that though, isn't there?

Tottenham are considered to be part of the so-called ""big six"", therefore the expectations are higher for them than they are for Villa, Forest and Newcastle.

Also, top five this season would mean instant Champions League qualification, whereas last season it did not, as Tottenham discovered after throwing away their chances at top four."
"Their wage bill is also 7th-highest in the league, so 5th is a slight overperformance but definitely the expected range"
"The first three you mentioned have been in the championship within the last ten years. This is Forests third(?) season back in the top flight

Spurs were in the champions league final the same season Villa got promoted"
"There's no excuse for finishing as low as they're going to though, injuries or not. If they were 8th? Sure."
"Injuries self inflicted by the Manager.

FTFY."
Ahhh westham ruined it
Tell the fans that a new manager will be announced right before the game so that Mourinho can return Steve Austin WWE style and run down the tunnel onto the pitch
For a goal that was disallowed a minute later.
"I think people, our own fans moreso, overestimate where the players are at quality wise. We have lots of kids with potential, have had excessive injuries and our senior players (Romero, Maddison, Son, Bent, Biss) are either not that good (Bent, Biss), or have been inconsistent (Son, Romero, Maddison).

We shouldn’t be 16th. But people saying 4th-7th would’ve been “Adequate” or whatever are deluded.

Ange is an ideologue manager; Pep being “The” ideologue manager. They have a set way or philosophy and require a certain talent and depth threshold to perform according to how they want. Without specific players and quality depth it falls apart. Ange isn’t an idiot, it’s just that we’ve mishired yet again and brought in a guy who has very specific needs for his team and we want him to be a pragmatist."
">maybe even below with our awful injuries. 

And awful league form"
"Exactly this! People saying the quality has dropped don’t have a clue, so many sides are so good now. That Mateta finish to level against us mid-week? It was phenomenal. Obviously poor moment from Saliba, but pinging in the top corner like that from distance wasn’t something that mid table sides forward’s habitually did 10+ years ago. There’s pressure in every game and an off season for a big club isn’t 7th or 8th any more it’s bottom half cos everyone shoots past you."
A quick glance at the table reveals there are 15 teams easily better than Spurs.
"Don't people want more honesty from people and press conferences otherwise these press conferences are pointless and full of the same diplomatic drivel.

I'm not defending Anges comments here as I think there is a bit of a limit to that desired honesty and he's dug himself enough of a reputational hole now that he could probably pull back and turn on the bland diplomacy more"
"I don't agree with the ""they jumped from 8th to 5th"" narrative.

When Conte was there they were 4th. He left, and then Stellini and Mason dropped to 8th.

Ange didn't have kane, but he did spend 270m, had no Europe to contend with, and finished 5th.

Conte was in 4th with Kane, but also with a back 5 of Lloris, Perisic, Dier, Lenglet, Emerson.

Anges back 5 was Vicario, Udogie, VDV, Romero, Porro.

For the the improvement in the back 5 more than compensates for the loss of Kane, especially with no  European football."
"That isn't a 'good story', Spurs should be in the race for CL spots. Missing out can never be considered a good season."
They ruinin it
You do have a lot of good young players. Unfortunate that Ange is unraveling like this. For a while it looked like he could be the one to bring the new generation forward.
"The perception of the players is often influenced by how much the manager is getting out of them. I think if it had another manager and were doing great under him you'd rate your players more too.


I don't think it would have been an exceptional season for Spurs had they finished 6th for example."
"Wow, thanks chief. Never would've guessed it. You know very well what we're talking about here."
"Reddit wanting honesty is not same as “people want more honesty”. The world still works like this, when you have a microphone, you say the most bland things. If you are in a position where your words are scrutinized, you get PR trained. Of course reporters may not like it, but it’s one less thing to hang around your head"
"Saying that back 5 compensates for losing the most effective and consistent striker in the league ffs 🤦

I adore bad takes but this one is a cake eater"
"> I don't agree with the ""they jumped from 8th to 5th"" narrative.

Literally what happened is not a 'narrative'."
"> Spurs should be in the race for CL spots.

Bollocks. No-one thought they were going to do that last season, be serious. They should have been this season, and that's the problem."
"Spurs fan but come on man. You cannot be serious.

If A-N-Y other club in the entire league, except for maybe City or Liverpool, loses Harry Kane, they struggle massively. 

Sure, we have a lot of resources and one would think we should be up there in and around it battling. 

But wake up man.

If Arsenal loses Saka, Rice, or Odegaard, or even Saliba, they struggle.

If Liverpool loses Salah or Van Dijk, they're going to struggle.

If Chelsea loses Cole Palmer, they would struggle. 

If Newcastle lose Anthony Gordon or Alexander Isak, they struggle massively. 

5th last year for Spurs is an accomplishment. 

This season however is an unmitigated disaster."
"If the basis of his success is m comparing him to not one, but two interim managers sure.

But the last full time manager Spurs had, had them in 4th."
"We lost eden Hazard and had a transfer ban too, and we finished top 4"
they also had harry kane at that point
"The basis of his success is taking a team that fell apart when the previous permanent manager spat the dummy out and got sacked and improving their league position significantly despite their greatest ever goalscorer being sold in the summer. 

How am I comparing him to two interim managers but not Conte? That is a fucking nonsense argument."
"Hell, your team won the league every other year. You guys had a fantastic squad.

I would say that's an outlier.

Also, one year we (Spurs) finished above you lot even when you had Hazard and your best team."
"He didn't improve their league position over Conte.

The team ""fell apart in 4th"" and Ange ""improved their league position significantly to 5th""?

Youre going to have to explain how 5th is a significant improvement on 4th."
"> He didn't improve their league position over Conte.

Conte was sacked after 28 games. Spurs had more points after 28 games last season than Conte's team did when he was sacked. 

> The team ""fell apart in 4th"" and Ange ""improved their league position significantly to 5th""?

They fell apart and **finished** 8th. Where they were after 28 games means absolutely fuck all, what are you talking about?"
"Conte wasn't there when they finished 8th

When Conte was there they were 4th"
They hate him more than Cristiano at this point
"Classico cold war and narrative battle in full swing on this sub today, you love to see it

that one simpsons gif with the fighting animals comes to mind"
Well that’s not cool
No no no they are chanting it in German!
"Lovely. Why can't you just support your team, banter a bit and just stop there?"
Guys you know its just football right?
wishing death on a player just fun banter amiright guys
"It’s scary and sad how normalized this become by opposing fans. This isn’t banter, this isn’t shithousery. Smfh disgusting"
"This is pretty shameful behaviour, hope they're all charged legally and banned from our stadium. There's football, and there's humanity. The latter is infinitely more important"
Some people are just bad and hateful to the bone. Shame to those who wish death to others.
"Okay, seriously. Why are non-Real Madrid fans so weird when it comes to Vini? It's not like he's the first non-white/European star player they ever had."
how me add flair for team?
The sheer obsession and hatred of these guys...
At this point. I think it's a ritual in Spain to chant this. Have seen many clubs fans does this before the match.
It's amazing how Vini lives for free in the minds of Barcelona fans and this sub
"This needs to stop. This kind of behavior from football ""fans"" needs to be eradicated. Heavy fines and banning from stadiums."
Just paid £15 for the match tonight hope its a good one
"Barca ""fans"" who've never stepped foot in spain: this is ""your"" club. This is who you ""support""."
"Remember that time where Vini got red carded because he received constant racism chants? 

Well, tonight the very same referee will be on the pitch"
"Yeah, no, fuck that. Shit on them all you want but this ain’t it."
Goddamn… this is the most intense clasico in years. This chant is disgusting though.
"Man why do they do this shit 
Making me nervous he might show up"
"I see more hate for Vini than for the violent and racist Suarez, which tells me everything I need to know about ignoring the Vini hate."
Yeah that’s def taking things too far
Mes que un club
"La Liga and Javier Tebas is a joke of a league.

Hit Barca in their pockets with a 2 match ban on fans at home games and this shit will end immediately, if not through the fans on their own then by Barca telling them to stop"
They’re going to look like fucking idiots if Vinicius ends up having a masterclass for them
How pathetic can you be to wish death on a human being because of one sport?
Literally proving Vini right
Why do they do this shit
"It's not racism, it's La Liga"
"Yes, do that, more of that, go ahead and tarnish our reputation more than it already is, give people more headlines to talk about and worst of all give Vini a reason to score a hatty on us lol"

This doesn't fit the common narrative so it's heavily downvoted. Harassing is okay as long as it's a Madrid player.

"The famous now german ""The Vinicius"""
"Can't we just shout ""Vini Balon de Playa""?"
The comments are awfully quiet for this thread and the other thread where a Real fan got fractured in the nose.
Damn Vini must have really provoked those hundreds of people that he has never interacted with before
Honestly I wonder what did he do to them that they wish death for him? Vini has his flaws I agree but this is going way too far. These people are the ones who actually deserves to die.
"It’s funny how the 'x muérete' chants are relevant because it happens to be Vini. It's something that has been going for ages and it's used for multitude of players in Spain. Even fucking Iniesta got them at Bernabeu after scoring a WC winning goal ffs. Is it bad? Maybe, though in Spanish an expression like that is not as harsh as in English, ‘muérete’ also is used as ‘go fuck yourself’. But the sociologists on reddit try to analyze it and look for racist undertones. 

Vini suffers a lot of racism during the season and we as a country fail to take the proper measures. But it’s also true that a lot of people in this sub prefer to overreact and farm for karma instead of actually denouncing his situation."
He seems to die after every small contact tbf
How could the English do this?
"Please don't hurt Vini, we need him in good condition to be sold this summer for the big bucks."
"I honestly can't see the problem with that, calling him a monkey, being racist and so forth is where I draw the line and believe there should be much bigger punishment, but desiring a players death is the most common thing in the world"
!flair :Barcelona:
Ah yes. The El Clasico. A showcase of mental illness from two of the most annoying and unhinged set of supporters in the world.
Well tbh I also don't like Vini. But this is just too pathetic
"it's so pathetic that this and racial insults are the only things spanish matchgoing fans can come up with. i've literally never heard them chant anything but ""muerete,"" ""puta [player],"" or just straight up racist/xenophobic shit. for a country where the players and national team have so much culture the fans have none, they have no actual songs or atmosphere. that's why i never bought the remontada bs from real madrid vs arsenal, all the fans probably did during that game was whistle their own players and shit like this"
Well that’s a bit extreme

Vini is a lot more dislikable with a lot less acumens"

"With all the fuel we’ve given you guys this year, chanting against Vini in one of his worst seasons in a while should not even be considered an option."
Most normal Spanish fans
come on it’s an inside joke amirite
Brazilian MMA fans say yes.
Better than racism though right? So there is progress being made. Unless they want him to die because he's black........
"Time ago I tried to explain that all the ""x muérete"" it's not about really wishing the death of a player but the cadence of the chant sounds good enough, same as back in the day many fans used to chant ""ese portugués hijoputa es"" to Cristiano Ronaldo. There is a good example about this kind of chants, one is ""[insert player] cabrón, saluda al campeón"""
"Just fyi tho those who say ""he deserves it for crying every game"" 


This started because a Brazilian player danced as his celebration. He'd done absolutely nothing wrong. They were pissed that he was good. Look at how much Yamal gets coddled for how big his ego (that Instagram pose yesterday for example) and compare it to what Vini had done around. The same age. 

And this doesn't even cover any of the moments where they were literally trying to end Vini's career with tackles that mostly went uncalled. Now imagine if Yamal had to undergo that"
It isn't illegal to say you wish someone died... What would you like them charged with?
"Idk Vini is very annoying to watch on the field, sadly a lot of football fans all over the world are dumb as rocks and they cant just make fun of how annoying he is on the pitch and with his complaining but have to go super personal and way over the line."
"Remember Neymar and his antics? Remember how it was so fucking annoying? It’s the same just different antics. 

Racist people cling onto this one so they get to express their racism. But it’s not like there’s no other reason why anyone could dislike Vini. And I don’t even hate the guy, he lets his emotions get the better of him sometimes, which is annoying.

I’ve been watching RM matches lately and he’s not even done anything recently, he’s really dialed down his reactions, which is awesome to see. But his antics will never not be what we know him for, just like Neymar, probably will never be able to shake it off, even if he stops doing it completely."
"It's interesting that people still ask this question. It's pretty obvious. He annoys most of everyone till no end with his on the field behavior.

Now normal people will whistle him and talk shit. But in every big crowd there will be a good amount of people who are not normal."
"I live in madrid, surrounded by RM fans, I don't recall a single star ever being as hated by his own team this much ever. Obviously they wont wish him death but Its not just non-RM fans. Bench players that fail to show up? Sure, but stars never been the case to this degree."
"Vinicius has always been one of the most hated players because of the kind of person he is: bad attitude, comments, personality, entitlement, etc. Has nothing to do with origin, but the person.

There's even plenty of Real Madrid fans who also have expressed his dislike/hate for him, especially in Spain. For instance when Vinicius openly said ""Spain should be disallowed from hosting the World Cup because Spain is a racist country""."
"He's ugly, that's it. Most of the football players are naturally above average looking guys obviously because they have to stay fit which makes them better looking than an average bloke working 9-5. 

On top of that if someone has a ""marketable"" face then that person would easily become fan favorite regardless of how they behave on pitch. In vini's case, no offense but he's not the best looking guy and that subconsciously alters our perspective towards him. Like how bruno is called a rat because of his teeth"
"They said he would fail in RM, he didn't. 

They can't have that."
"Can't explain, I'm heavily biased towards the guy.

But it's basically Neymar in reverse."

You're getting a lot of downvotes from people who don't understand literal translations between languages don't work.
And? What does that have to do with this? Does a player deserve death for anything they might do on a football pitch?
It can’t be so serious that I would wish harm upon Vini. Hope Real Madrid loses…but thats all. He’s a human being like the rest of us.
so why aren’t they chanting that about barcas players?
"What a lovely defense, arent you a lawyer by a chance?"
Which Barca players are Madrid fans chanting this at? Can you link a clip?
What a shit take.
"You would have done the same if you were a piece of shit too, is not the defence you think it is"
hah would they lmao i dont think so lmao who knows lmao
Is he? As a Barça fan i definitely dislike Vini more. Cr7 could justify his attitude more and really basked in the hate.
"Why is this downvoted, that is a huge part of why people don't like Vini"
Vinicius plays the victim so Barca fans chanting that he should die makes sense? Got hit on the head as a child or something?
He's also white.
Cristiano dove far more than Vincius.
I won't allow this jinx.

"Yep, not like other leagues. There's so much to learn from the Dutch, French, English, Serbian fans... where they behave like normal human beings"
"They were already chanting it back when all the racist shit happened all at once. So yeah, it is racism related."
I saw a stat that a yellow card is produced for every 10 fouls on Vini while a card is produced for every 3 fouls on Yamal. Pretty crazy difference if you ask me. And even from watching the games you can see that opposition get a few kicks at Vini before the ref even gives a slight warning
weird considering how many brazilian players did the same for barcelona in the past
Except Neymar only flopped and embellished some hard fouls. Vini does that + create drama for every small thing off the field + is generally a toxic player on the field. He’s also not even half the player Neymar was
"You say that but what differentiates him from players like Vardy, Maupay, ibra?"
Yeah and as football is pretty vocal I m sure there are certain “fans” who are Hooligans and shit
"""Has nothing to do with origin"" While knowing the amount of racism he had received, is pathetic."
"yeah he's clearly a heel so he's hated by a lot of opposing fans for football/spectacle reasons, and the fact that he's black/south american means that he's also hated by a lot of racist/xenophobic people. and unfortunately those two cricles have an overlap."
you're spot on
Yeah his looks do play a part in it

La frase ""muerete"" puede expresar ira de varias maneras, dependiendo del contexto y el tono. Generalmente, se usa para expresar una fuerte molestia o enojo, deseando que la persona a quien se dirige, o el causante del problema, desaparezca o sufra. 
Interpretaciones de ""muerete"" en el contexto de la ira:
Deseo de desaparición:
Implica un deseo de que la persona desaparezca o deje de molestar.
Deseo de sufrimiento:
Puede expresar un deseo de que la persona sufra las consecuencias de sus acciones.
Exclamación de furia:
Se puede usar como una exclamación de ira, mostrando el enojo que se siente en ese momento.
Amenaza:
En algunos contextos, puede ser interpretada como una amenaza de daño o agresión."

"I think I expressed myself wrongly, desiring is the wrong word, expressing the desire under the expectation that no one believes is correct, is like calling someone a filho da puta/hijo del puta, you don't even know the guys mom, you don't really think she is a whore

Man seemed to thrive on it. Vini let's it get to his head
The huge part is that is that most of the vini hate is racist in nature. Just the truth.
"The concept of personal accountability is lost on most people.

Vini acts like an arrogant, insufferable whiny cunt *constantly*. It doesn't justify the chants, but he's hardly the first one to be the target of them and he certainly won't be the last one, and the man has done his fair share to earn the hate. But because he's wearing the white shirt^(tm) all criticism on his behaviour is automatically invalid and the critics are downvoted to oblivion and classified as racist."

"ThE ReFs HaTe Us. I saw a stat also, that rmtv targeted a ref that badly, they cried publicly. Apparently no other club has done that 👏👏"
"People love to shit on Vini for complaining, but I can totally see them making excuses in a few years when Yamal will start doing the same.

The more he preforms the more defenders will start going at him. If he can't shut his mouth now with how much of an ego he has, I can guarantee you that the first tackle on him will have him tears"
"Man, Real Madrid fans really love to play the victim huh. As if the refs don't constantly help you guys out."
Probably because Vini flops and embellishes more so the refs hesitate to call his fouls
"From my perspective it seems that there’s two main reasons. One is that Vinicius is more likely to react to the crowd in a manner that hurts Madrid, this encourages fans to say nasty things that get under his skin. The other is racism"
"Vini is by far and away the biggest diver in the sport. You can't compare the others. He's also consistently whining and whining and whining every single game.

He is an unlikeable guy but the amount of hate he gets is ridiculous and obviously racist based to the point you can't have normal conversations about him on the internet without the army of racist fucks destroying any nuance on it.
No one earns racism bro. Fuck off. Call him shit or whatever but saying he’s instigated actual racist chants is bizarre and def says a lot about you. How can Vini be personally accountable that a lot of Spanish fans are racist shitheads?
You are an embarrassment to Barca and as a human. Fuck off.

Grow up."
Case in point.
whatever you say bud
Alaba is injured so that’s not happening

I don't know how anyone could say Neymar dived more than Vini in Spain. Neymar was a lot less bad in every way. At least until he joined PSG.
Sounds like you haven't. Also I'm talking about currently. Not the past.

He is constantly fouled and fouled bad - no consequences (for example Sociedad last match).

Yet when he fights back HE is annoying- that is shifting the focus on him.

Lmao you can't be fucking serious hahahahaha

>However

There is no ""however"" here. You posted an AI generated segment here and falsely declared it to be ""from the RAE"". If you did any kind of scientific work in your life, you'd knew that this is just fabrication of evidence and straight up fraud.

When called out upon this you moved goalposts and talked about a ""briefing"" (what briefing? The RAE doesn't brief Google AI lol), asked me to ask the RAE (lmao) and provided a much different, much shorter segment to somehow prove your point again. But if that segment did that, why did you not just copy that segment in the first place instead of using AI to come up with something much longer but still declaring that to be from the RAE?

And all of this to what? Justify and downplay death threats towards a player you don't like in the year 2025. Man, you're a headcase. You're probably gonna block me now and pretend that never happened, but that must be a fucking low to hit."

My goat. Now and forever.
"I'm not ready for Müller to potentially retire. One of my all time favorite players.


The Bundesliga will feel off without him and Reus. At least we still have Götze."
"Ribéry <3

He had 0.45 assists per 90 minutes in the Bundesliga which is genuinely STUPID"
He debuted in 2009/10 correct? So that's like what 15/16 seasons in total?
"Basically every season when he was a full starter, and then a few when he wasn't. I'm not ready for football without him"
So peak that he has an entire role named after him in football manager
"he is my favourite player that has no connection with my club, what a legend"
Has Müller ever spoken about how he developed his game from a young age?  He must have made a conscious decision to develop the skill of winning the ball back and immediately playing a perfectly weighted assist.
Andreas Möller has 5. Why is he missing here?
Vincenzo Grifo my beloved
I'm surprised to not see Micoud or Misimovic on this list
I think it would be important to show how many seasons they also played
Littbarski ❤️ my first ever football hero
"Why is he not getting a new contract? Bayern should just do what Madrid are doing with modric and just keep renewing every year, he’s still good enough"
Müller + Lewandowski was legendary partnership
"Someone with so many assists and goals, would be a waste to not become a coach/manager"
">At least we still have Götze.

How do Germany & Bundesliga fans normally feel about Gotze? Is he (still) good or bad now?

 feel like we never hear about him, as a non-German, non-Bundesliga watcher"
"08/09 he played 4 games in the league. But if we don't count that, then it's out of 16 seasons."
Insane stat
"Apparently he was more of a full striker in his youth, not a playmaker/secondary striker/""winger with roaming tendencies"" like he played for Bayern and the national team. I couldn't find an article that's not behind a paywall (or not German) so here' it's from Müller's homepage:

https://esmuellert.de/teams/

> #1998
>
> Die beste Torquote der Karriere von Thomas Müller. Die E-Jugend-Mannschaft des TSV Pähl erzielte 165 Saisontore. Davon gingen 120 auf das Konto von Thomas Müller. Schwierig, das noch einmal zu überbieten...

Translation (via deepl)

> #1998
>
> The best goal tally of Thomas Müller's career. The TSV Pähl e-youth team scored 165 goals this season. Of these, 120 were scored by Thomas Müller. Difficult to beat that again...

E-Youth team are players from about age 8 to 11:

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Jugend"
Maybe different ways of counting Assists(won penalties or something like that??) that put him below 10. That's typically the reason for different numbers of assists.
Data for back than is lacking and Kicker has him at 3 seasons with 10+ Assists and 2 with 9.
I think you're misreading the stat.
Also Robben man
"Because he currently earns 20m per year and hasn’t been a regular starter for basically 2 years now!



He’s also 35 and his energy levels are nowhere near what they once were."
He's our most important playmaker this season and I'm pretty concerned about our end of the season without him.
">How do Germany & Bundesliga fans normally feel about Gotze?

if he hadn't scored the world cup final goal, he probably wouldn't be anywhere near the type of popularity he has. He's kinda ""fallen off"" in status bc he never lived up to the hype he was built up with, but I think every Bundesliga fan is happy to see that he's kinda ""recovered"" and doing well at Frankfurt.

That said, I think Götze will likely, at least for the generation that witnessed him, go down as one of the most impressive players they've watched live. His peak may have been short lived, but it was an impressive peak."
"[89/90](https://www.kicker.de/andreas-moeller/spieler-einsaetze/bundesliga/1989-90/borussia-dortmund) he has 14, [91/92](https://www.kicker.de/andreas-moeller/spieler-einsaetze/bundesliga/1991-92/eintracht-frankfurt) he has 10, [95/96](https://www.kicker.de/andreas-moeller/spieler-einsaetze/bundesliga/1995-96/borussia-dortmund) he has 13, [96/97](https://www.kicker.de/andreas-moeller/spieler-einsaetze/bundesliga/1996-97/borussia-dortmund) he has 14 and [00/01](https://www.kicker.de/andreas-moeller/spieler-einsaetze/bundesliga/2000-01/fc-schalke-04) he has 11 according to kicker's own data"
"Robben was kinda the inverse Ribery when it comes to those numbers. He had high goal scoring numbers and low assist numbers while Ribery had way more assists but relatively few goals. So him getting few seasons with double digit assists is not surprising. His main hobby was cutting inside and shooting, not passing.

But overall Bayern, during their peak here, was also a team that relied less on one big scorer and distributed goal scoring duties much more though the whole attacking lineup. I really like that that about them.

The one big striker thing came back with Lewy, and I'd say especially because of Ancelotti. He relied more on individual magic than the ""whole team better than the sum of its parts"" approach from before (under Jupp and Pep) and instilled in Lewy a greed to score. 

Despite the shortcoming of Ancelotti's time here that one of the things he did really well and I'd say, he's a big reason for why Lewy developed even at the high level he was playing.

That, an managing a midfield of Vidal and Thiago. Under Pep they kinda stood on each other's feet too much but Ancelotti pushed Thiago into a 10-ish positions (where he did really well, and also had ridiculous defensive stats) while Vidal essentially played a goal to goal midfielder (instead of a box to box one) who also often helped out anywhere from defence to goal scoring.

For a manager who didn't fit that team he still had a few positive influences."
"Your concerns were well addressed today, if I may say. "
"Fair enough, you'd rather be good than terrible"
He peaked too early :/
Listen when Aragorn asks you to do so

"I mean legend has it that Neil Warnock got yelled at by Sean Bean when Sheffield United got relegated and it made his daughter cry, so it wouldn't be the first time someone in football has been chewed out by a LOTR cast member."
"# This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. You owe him your allegiance."
The king has spoken
"""You draw far too much attention to yourself, Mr. Moretti."""
Genuinely think I'd have to get some professional help to better myself if Aragorn is the one criticising me. 
I just find it fascinating that San Lorenzo got Aragorn and the late Pope as famous fans.
I love Viggo man
What King Aragorn connection to San Lorenzo ?
To the list
How bad do you have to be at your job to get Aragorn himself to publicly ask you to quit?
"Damn Joey Cusa... I mean, Tom Stall making his feelings clear on the matter"
"For those interested, he also has an article criticising Real Madrid for what they are doing before the Match against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey. English translation by Google, too long to do it manually for free:

""This 2024-25 season, the behavior decreed for Real Madrid Club de Fútbol by Florentino Pérez through his official statements and all kinds of propaganda manipulations carried out by his staff at the newspaper Marca and Real Madrid Television is shameful, very damaging. The tantrums of a spoiled child, on par with someone as insecure and disastrous as Donald Trump. I say this as a loyal Real Madrid fan.

The current policy of the Real Madrid board is mind-boggling, the continued lack of respect for the referees, for the last Ballon d'Or ceremony, and now for the Royal Spanish Football Federation and the other Copa del Rey finalist, FC Barcelona. All this whining, all this spitefulness, is a sore loser. I hope that at least Real Madrid plays in the Final, and that the players aren't asked to display the same cowardice and unsportsmanlike behavior that characterizes the club's president lately. And may the best man win.
-Viggo Mortensen""

I am very tempted to post this in r/realmadrid, him being a Real Madrid fan lmao"
There's a difference between getting chewed out by Boromir the traitor and King Aragon. 
"He lived in Argentina from the age of 2 to 11 years old, do most of his early childhood. He became a San Lorenzo supporter there

Supposedly the colours of Aragorn's armour in return of the king (blue, red and white) was a petition from Viggo so that it matches the colours of San Lorenzo"
"He got controlled once in an airport because he was watching a San Lorenzo game on this phone and he yelled the name of the player who had just scored for them (Leandro Romagnoli aka Pipi)... So he yelled Pipi, and people thought he was a crazy man who'd just peed on himself"
Everything I hear about Viggo makes me like him more.
Real Madrid fans are not a monolith.
"In this house Boromir is a goddamn hero. Greater men (and elves, and hobbits) than he have been tempted by the One Ring. He gave his life defending Merry and Pippin against many foes."
"Bro Boromir fought the forces of Sauron for so long, he is from Isildur which is next to Mordor.

He was the only full blood man to join the fellowship, he was tempted by the corrupted ring but it worked because he had severe PTSD and saw too many of his soldiers die to the orcs."
Have you ever actually read LOTR?
Sorry no boromir slander allowed
"Watertown, New York to Argentina is a trip I imagine not that many people make"
"And he still speaks Spanish impeccably and like a local (from Buenos Aires), no accent from anywhere else."
"He's kind of Aragorn in real life pretty much, so yeah"
Minas Tirith my guy!!!
Watching is enough to have nothing but love for boromir

Most casual bicycle kick I've ever seen
Average mls goal
That dude is ripped
He has been so good (apart from a 3 game stretch where he couldn’t hit anything on target) this season. Well worth the price we got him for
Reposting with a corrected title.
Took my 2 year old to his first game and left at half before he lost his shit.    I have regrets
Great goal.
If you guys get that many bicycle kicks we should all watch MLS to be fair!
And he's vegan. I shudder to think what he'd look like without the self-imposed hurdle.
It's nice when a $16 million signing ends up being a no-brainer.
"The MLS has taken a massive step the last few years.  It’s now consistently rated above the Championship, about equivalent to the Belgian league.  "
"We do have more than our fair share of bangers

My own team excluded, since any goal at all is a gift from above"
"For what it's worth, it doesn't sound like a self-imposed hurdle. From his [FCC signing announcement: ](https://www.fccincinnati.com/news/kevin-denkey-sees-fc-cincinnati-as-a-natural-choice-and-arrives-knowing-they-can-reach-the-highest-level)""When he turned pro he began eating a vegetarian diet to stay in the best shape possible, and when he saw the result paying off, he pushed more towards a fully Vegan diet.""  
  
What an insane goal and physique"
"Haha, what team is that? I know some of the MLS logos but idk that one"
"Oof, 9 points from 9 games is bad. Then again at least you aren’t LA Galaxy, damn they suck, only 3p!"
We have scored 5 goals in 9 games and 3 of those came against the Galaxy lmao

Jude cursing in Spanish lmao
"bellingham was clearly expecting the ball to be played wide for a cross that way he would be able to get back onside and hopefully not get picked up when the cross comes in since he was standing in an offside position prior



seems like he’s frustrated his teammates didn’t catch on"
Nasty nutmeg. Very nasty.
What a move to escape the press
My heart skipped a beat..
How could the referee do this
Madrid got in the ref’s head you can see how reluctant he is to give them cards
Is that Pedri he's toying with at the start? damn bro
That turn to get rid of Pedri looks like something Zidane would do tho
I can't fathom people in England thinking they shouldn't build the national team around Bellingham.
why did he not try to get back onside at all lmao
" he pointed to ceballos to give it outside, ceballos is not very smart he was obviously offside"
What a nutmeg man
Jude definitely was one of the best Madrid players today
"RMTV: OMG, bias referee, check your eyes mate, that's miles onside."
"Closer than I expected tbh. If the pass was a second late he would have been inside, martin was tracing back"
Jude have to do better.
"Bro is gassed at 34 min, he was miles offside... wasted a good position"
Bro thought he scored
It would've been a pretty goal really if he was onside
Same bro same
Or check var for two penalties already
That was nasty
"Just a guess but I think he thought the ball would be played wide, so the line retreats playing him onside and then no one would cover him, because he was just offside. Often works and could be smart if his teammate could see he was offside."
Tired maybe seeing as he just ran 100 yards
Was probably waiting for the cutback if the ball went wide
One for dragging cubarsi down during corner and one for the handball at first 
"Yes 
first cross towards the box defender slides and stopped the ball with his hand. Penalty
Corner kick hits the far post and the player who would’ve had a chance to tap it in is on the ground after being tackled by Real Madrids defender"
"1.)Shirt tugging and dragging cubarsi 
2.)  rudiger kicked ferran back of the heel"
"The handball was never going to be given and isn’t supposed to, his hand is there for support."
Jovic got injured in training apparently.
Why is everyone in this team selfish? Just pass the fucking ball!!!!
"Holy shit Santi scored!!!

Amazing assist and amazing finish honestly."
Wanted that ten goal bonus. Spirit of the Tall king
"Come on, Milan, I want Parma to stay up!!"
"Damn, two very close calls for Venezia there."
That would have been one of the funniest goals of the season if that Abraham dribble actually led to an assist.
Can't say it's not deserved.
"What a goal btw, we need to wake up because we're doing that thing again when we take the lead and then take the foot off the gas. You can't just do the bare minimum you lazy bastards"
Funny that Musah will never play for the club again now that they use a formation he has a position in.
"I've been unimpressed by everyone on Milan, not named Fofana, who's been everywhere. 

On the other side, Venezia has some ballers."
"nice finish from gimenez, keep it up boy and go back to starting 11"
Buongiorno to all the fans of teams that won their last match.
Early goal early in the day!
And Napoli couldn't even score one...
C’mon Puli… I love you but that was some dickhead shit 😭
Pavlovic having a difficult day
"Deserved, sadly."
We're really testing fate here. Saved by an offside that the players didn't even know about.
Should probably sub Theo out just in case.
"We have to keep Baby Salad away from Real Madrid, they could turn adorably grumpy into complete dickhead in about a week and a half"
There's no way we walk out with a clean sheet here. An absolute disaster of a performance from everyone today.
rlc bby what is you doin
The gates of the shadow realm have opened
"How many times has Theo failed at the solo run thing since that goal vs Atalanta? Every time he gets the ball on a dangerous counter, he always tries to go alone and he always fails at it."
That looks like a clear pen for Yeboah. Not sure why they don't call that.
"A bookend victory. Pleased for Santi

ETA. Como safe though"
"We did our best to give them 6 points, but they wasted 3 of them."
If you aren't clenching it's not a Milan match
We didn't even do the bare minimum. That was a Venezia mistake that gifted us that goal.
thank god i dont have to see that bum again
VAR has a trashcan for a heart
I detect the hint of an agenda
Similar enough to the one on Leão. Can't really call one and not the other.
"
>Como safe though

Giant fucking asterisk though. Maybe they'll need to spend another €100m to stay up next season."
"Honestly, I'm just waiting for the Fofana shot."
"Kinda. Yeboah is killing everyone on the left side, so we may as well try someone else there."
As tradition requires

"Great finish, absolutely no hesitation in taking the shot"
"Nico heard you talking shit.

But seriously, what a fucking relief for the guy. Hopefully it kicks his confidence back in"
incredible press from Chalobah to make that happen
That's a really nice finish
A strikers strike get in Nico
"People trashing Nico in the match thread. Here you fucking go. This is Nico. No touches with no service, but when he does get it, it's done."
"Jackson turning into Prime Drogba when we really need him the most.

Please keep playing like this till Nottingham Forest."
What a finish
"Good tackle from Chalobah, good quick forward pass from Enzo, good snap shot from Jackson"
NICOlas JACKson
Maresca celebrating from prison. 
"Terrific finish, but we also have to talk about Chalobah's knock away"
"MY STRIKER.

Oh I've missed you for weeks."
damn is he actually back?
My sweet prince has returned
Man I love Nico. Hope this is the start for him
What a player Enzo Fernandez is
Now do Palmer
Proper striker's finish let's go JACKson
close enough welcome back drogba
#JACK^(son)
Cole Palmer looks like he aged 10 years under maresca
"good positioning by Jackson, what a strike!"
We have a striker?!
I can't believe this is the same guy I was calling shit last season. Fantastic finish.
what a shot
Reminder that every /r/soccer pundit was saying Enzo was an overrated racist cunt just a few months ago.
That's how you break your drought. Keep that one out god damn
"I feel he's best when he's instinctive like that. Sometimes he labours on the ball a bit and seemingly gets in his own head; leading to the wrong decision. 

When he's on form he is much more instinctively clinical like this."
You could see him taking it in near the corner flag. Must be a huge relief for him.
"Haha he must not have heard me talking shit for the past few months. Great finish, hopefully his form improves for the last few match weeks"
He's looked really good today. Played some great balls over the top that have given us much more tempo in attack. Also some important defensive bits
Enzo did well to
"I was just about to say

Incredible tackle there"
"that’s what Fofana does a lot the times earlier this season 

Maresca ball might be one dimensional but when it works, it works. Chalobah might or might not be the one suited for that position, but we do need another fast paced front foot left CB since Fofana is made out of glass"
"The movement, the dribbling and the passing make him better than all our strikers since Costa."
Nico heard them talking shit.
"Good for him for scoring an excellent goal, but let’s not pretend he’s just been starved of opportunities to score in his dry spell. He’s a long, long way from being some clinical finisher. 

 He’s very good at progressing the ball, and oftentimes struggles to score for a lack of finishing nuance. The platonic ideal of a confidence goal scorer. The sooner he is replaced, the better for Chelsea."
lol ay 1 out of 10 is still 1 yeah
Why only till Nottingham? Play like this till he is with us
"Yeah, and his name is Nicolas JACKson"
Well they've got the racist part right
I love how a couple minutes later the US commentator says that Pickford likely wished he would have done better. I don’t think anyone is saving that
I think everyone is like that when confident.
"He's been injured for most of the past few months, only recently returned, so that's a bit harsh from you"
Shame he'll be considered pure profit in the summer.
Giroud was pretty good as well
"I hope he comes good and becomes consistent. In fact, I could say that about the whole team really."
that a very low bar tbh.
This is a copypasta lmao
"Given it was his first goal in 13 games, he's not confident though"
Second year in a row our defense has dramatically improved with him in the team
"Chelsea should be challenging for the title. Pure profit or not, Chalobah isn’t going to elevate us there."
You're right. I really rated Giroud too.
"Jackson is better than Giroud. Giroud was an excellent fit for an otherwise hardworking front line (Havertz, Werner, Mount), but he could not put in the same kind of miles as Jackson."
Same. Even Madueke today for example. If only that was more consistent. We really need to make sure that development never halts again from now on.
"But still he beat the likes of Falcao, Higuain, Morata that's some big names"
"Mon dieu, I’ve been had. Deceived. Duped. Given the runaround."
The higher ups care more about improving the finances than improving on the pitch.
"Sure but he’s our best cb right now, makes no sense to get rid"
2 of them were beyond washed before moving to Chelsea and the other is a money laundering player
Not really improving finances when they're selling players like him to buy more players beyond requirements to then need to sell again
"He’s not really. He’s had some awful matches since he’s been back too. 

I feel like he’ll play awful and I won’t hear these “he’s our best CBs”. Then he plays well and everyone is back out."
I think that was a tongue in cheek comment. We can also add Pato to that list.
it’s crazy how Falcao was considered washed back then but then the very next season he was frankly better than mbappe who had a breakout season and played a pivotal part in monaco knocking city out. I think about him chipping claudio bravo on a daily basis
Hes the least bad one. Colwill number two. Maybe Tosin three?
Yeah fair I got wooshed
"He was never the same player after the injury regardless but keep in mind he came to the prem directly after doing his acl against French farmers, confidence is a massive thing and seemed to rediscover that under jardim at Monaco. Prime falcao would bag for any team in any league, elite gunman."
"In your opinion. Doesn’t make it a fact. All of them minus Fofana are relatively same level. For me, pre-injury Badiashile showed more than Chalobah ever did and has recently also been playing well. Tosin seems to have less lows and highs. Chalobah is very low then very high. Colwill seems also has those lows and highs. 

The idea that it “makes no sense” to sell him I just don’t get, though. Chalobah is behind Fofana, who does have injury issues. But they seem to be behind Acheampong. So why keep?

They are targeting a guy who can cover both sides and also chose two LCBs to round it out. Makes all the sense."

I'm here for the Opta last word rage. They've stepped up their game.
Oh. I got the reference. Gandalf as in you shall not pass. Witty.
"In just over 16 months, they'll get another shot at increasing that record"
"This is even better than the crazy Chelsea 04/05 defence. 

Burnley: 30 cleans sheets from 45—66.7%

Chelsea: 25 clean sheets from 38—65.8%"
Saruman's clear
I love Opta last word.
I'm going to start randomly ending my sentences in Gandalf from now on. Gandalf.
Holy shit that's one impressive stat. they should add to their badge CSC (Clean Sheet Champions).
So is it gandalf the white or gandalf the grey? Which one?
I like the simple word Gandalf. It’s almost better than putting what he said in.
It gets the people going
I groaned and rolled my eyes as I processed that. Are they just trying to ragebait interactions?
I've always hated it.
"lol i thought is was Gandalf as in ""I was there Gandalf."" since the last time was so long ago"
"Oh, I thought it was something to do with them all having hairy toes."
I used to call Daniel Sturridge Balrog because he never did. 
"It is. They haven't conceded more than a single goal in any of their 45 games.

Even that famous Chelsea side gave up 2 goals twice."
Wouldn’t say it’s better when Chelsea’s was in the premier league
"Think they're level with 1978-79 Liverpool right now, 28 clean sheets from 42 - 66.7%.

If they get one on the final day it'll be the best ever I think."
"usually not, but today they nailed it."
"Huh, I took it as Gandalf the white, as in clean sheets."
"And the fact they’ve conceded only 15 in 45, whereas Chelsea conceded the same in 7 less games"
"Statistically, it is."
I took it as Burnley really hates Merry.
There’s probably a Sunday league team with a higher clean sheet percentage. They aren’t statistically better than Chelsea’s team.
"I took at as Burnley were hitting their head on the ceiling, and Scott Parker just wants tea thank you"
"But they are? Just because they're probably not the best statistically because there's probably a Sunday League team with a higher clean sheet percentage doesn't mean they're not statistically better than Chelsea's team. Based on this very statistic, they do have a higher clean sheet percentage. I never said their season is a statistically better season or that their achievement is bigger or more impressive."

Well done 👏 going to be a crazy season for them
"Can go back to enjoying them next season now, it’s not as fun when you’re playing in the same league as them."
"Wow, incredible!!"
From the National League to the Championship in 3 seasons is honestly insane. McElhenny and Reynolds have to be heroes to that community.
"It was for us. We drew and beat them.

Honestly wanted them in the playoffs if we make it, as they were the only team we seemed to have the number of. 

Can only assume they were much better against everyone else."
I can’t do it in FM most the time
"Stockport could match it if we make it up in the play offs with a fraction of the money and beat Wrexham to the two titles along the way. 

Now that would be an achievement considering we lost or best player in Jan whilst Wrexham decided to sign ex Premier League players."
"Tbh they were nothing special against us, both games were 0-0. The whole Hollywood circus was very tiring. But now can be a spectator instead of a participant"
"I can get up promoted from league 2 on just free transfers and then league 1 depends on what the bargain hunter finds.

I'm typically in the champo for 3-5 seasons though"
"4 seasons total, 3 consecutive promotions"
"22/23, 23/24, and 24/25 is 3 seasons."
"They didn't get promoted the first season under new ownership, i think they lost in the play offs"
"Heinous. But a win is a win. Not that it has any significance, but it is a win"
"If Venezia didn't sell Pohjanpalo they would have avoided relegation, I'm sure of that

They create a lot of chances but they can't finish shit"
"There's good defensive football and then there's whatever this was. But I'm not gonna complain about a win this season.

Let's stack these up for once this season and finish the campaign with a little bit of dignity."
i just hope we go full u18 in the Serie A game against Bologna to rest everyone
"Fair play to Venezia, they play some good stuff. Pleased with Pulisic and Fofana's perfomance today, and the way Walker came in. I feel like Milan from before the formation change loses this game"
I hope Venezia can escape relegation bc this is such a beautiful stadium.
"Still have doubts about the Venezia penalty shout, if the referee had given it I would not have been outraged"
"I randomly watched, and you're not lying. I was shocked at how bad Milan looked with the exception of Fofana who was the best player on the pitch."
"I don't think their problem is scoring goals. I think they've conceded goals in most of their games this season, so you're asking a relegation side team to be able to score at a rate that is far beyond their capabilities. If they had sorted out their defensive issues early on, they would have been somewhere in midtable by now."
"It was essentially exactly the same as the foul on rafa a couple minutes back,which wasn't called. Either or neither was fine, they weren't excessive showings but the tone was already set."

Hohes Bein. Freistoß
"3 really good matches on paper, should make for a great Konferenz"
Come on EFFZEH 
i should probably fix our emoji in the table now that we're safe but ever since i changed it we've gone 6 unbeaten...
Two wins for promotion. Win today and the game v Regensburg will be a party atmosphere
"bro, niemals ist das ein elfer. der hsv bekommt den aufstieg geschenkt."
Hamburgs zwölfter Mann
"Wollt eigentlich sagen, dass die 96er heute gegen zwölf spielen. Aber Mannschaft und Fans halten gut gegen. Dennoch, der FC braucht die drei Punkte. Und Gott segne Marvin Schwäbe, der hat uns bisher gerettet."
"Damn, what a match day"
"Diese Sky-Konferenzen sind so verwirrend. Manchmal gibt's extra Konferenz-Kommentatoren, manchmal glaube ich nicht mal das (vielleicht aber auch nur bei DAZN oder bei internationalen Konferenzen, kein Plan, aber meine das gab's mal?), manchmal die Kommentatoren der einzelnen Spiele und ein ""Meta""-Kommentator?

Alles, um Geld zu sparen, schätze ich, aber wenn man die Produktionsqualität von DAZN und Sky mittlerweile sieht, kann man sich irgendwie nicht vorstellen, dass da auch nur ansatzweise nachhaltig gewirtschaftet wird."
"Am meisten für einen HSV-Aufstieg spricht derzeit, dass die Mannschaften zwischen Platz 3 - 10 so viele Punkte liegen lassen, dass man den Eindruck gewinnt, dass keiner aufsteigen möchte. Andererseits, wenn der HSV auch heute nicht gewinnt und so weiter macht, dann reicht es trotzdem nicht."
Dompe contract extension here we go!!!
LOU FÜR DEUTSCHLAND
Kurz n Weg finden uns zu ficken?
Was ein geiles Tor hahaha
"They're Hamburging it again in April, can't believe my eyes"
"Würde gerne wissen, was da überhaupt so lange gecheckt werden musste. Vielleicht einfach nur übertriebene Sorgfalt, um in so einem wichtigen Aufstiegsspiel nichts zu übersehen? Aber eigentlich war's ja doppelt klar, dass das niemals Abseits sein kann."
"Wir müssen vorlegen, aber wenn der HSV das noch choket...Junge, Junge...kriegen wir dann Davie Selke zurück?"
"HSV hat eindeutig Angst vor uns, anders kann man sich das nicht mehr erklären."
"Hamburg spielt nur noch gegen Teams von unten in den letzten 3 Spieltagen also sollte es selbst mit einer Niederlage heute eigentlich reichen, da man wegen Tordifferenz eigentlich 4 Punkte vorne ist (zum Glück haben Paderborn, Elversberg, Magdeburg und Düsseldorf alle nicht gewonnen).

Auf der anderen Seite ist dieser Verein mittlerweile einfach verflucht bzw. die Spieler haben eine Mentaleblokade."
vamos ksc dont let me down
Elfmeterentscheidungen für und gegen den KSC in den letzten paar Monaten müssen untersucht werden.
"Lol, keep it as it is and there could be a chance of promotion next year at this rate…"
is 🦖now the team that has been in the devision for the most consecutive seasons among all current teams ?
Bro denkt wir steigen auf haha
es hätte mich echt nicht gewundert
Zahlung kam verspätet
"Warte erst bis du die ganze nächste Woche die gleichen, schon 100 Mal gebrachten Witze über den HSV lesen musst"
"Dann muss er den Elfer aber auch prüfen. Wir haben letzte Woche 1:1 den selben Elfmeter zurückgenommen bekommen, 8 Jahre und es gibt immer noch keine klare Linie mit diesem Dreck."
"Yes, they've been down there for seven seasons."
Ich fühle eh nichts mehr von daher macht das nichts.
my joy is immeasurable and my day is saved!
"Der HSV ist wie ein guter Wein – braucht einfach länger, um nach oben zu reifen."

He's probably the best football channel when it comes to these types of videos
"Balòn produces documentaries that are visually better than Sky Sports and Netflix combined, Kudos to him🙏🏼"
A very worth it watch in my opinion. This video really represents why zizou is one of my favourites and even as a barca fan i admit that his class and elegance on the pitch was beautiful to watch
"Thanks for sharing! Saved to watch later.

 Looks like a great YT channel too"
"Great doc, I’ve watched it, really nice"

"18th - Montpellier is officially relegated to Ligue 2 for the first time since 2003/04 (back then as 20th and last with 31 points). Cleaver.

This is Wahbi Khazri's 4th relegation. He has also been relegated from Ligue 1 with AS Saint-Étienne. From the Premier League when he was playing for Sunderland and from Ligue 2 with SC Bastia."
One of their best players is off to Bournemouth in the summer. They are candidates to go right back down
Not surprising
Lezgoooooo lil bro is getting back in. Now we need Guingamp asap !
"What the hell happened to montpellier?
Also, surely this means Chotard is leaving, no?"
All their best players will just get shipped off to Bournemouth some time in the future - multi-club ownership is a cancer
"Montpellier is completely broke, we knew they were going down since the strat of the season with their catastrophic summer window.

Yeah Chotard is a gonner, same as their best players. There is a real potential for a back to back relegation."

WE WILL BE THERE.
"Look at Ronaldo's movement, GK had no reason not to defend that but Ronaldo still goes in just in case"
The difference in levels is insane. Saudi clubs are far better in Asia
Say his name
I'm sorry but I don't see how this game is fair at all. Yes it's 11pm in Saudi now but it's literally 5am in Japan with all the travel fatigue after 10 hours of flight and they expect all the player to ball. 
WE WILL BE THERE!!!!!!
"Yeah, this goal really shows the huge level of play disparity."
We will be there
"Thats 66, realistically now he could be taking three seasons to reach there because it's not really in Portugal's interest to play him anymore"
NO MATTER WHAT
"I mean it's all a bit of a joke, they got the foreign restriction dropped, and these knockout games are all single legs HELD IN SAUDI ?????????"
"Yeah, they have bigger budget than all the other AFC clubs combined, so no wonder."
Well yeah its like making PSG and City play in the conference lol
I'd think the PIF pockets run very deep compared to everyone else
Yokohama are last (20th) in the J1 at the moment.
They are probably about the same level as Mexican clubs and a bit better than American clubs.
And he appears.
"Bro even in Saudi, most people don't go to games at 11:45pm kick off.

AFC needs to find a better solution"
"Why do people say things like this? He plays every qualifier and nations league. 

Why would it not be in their interest?"
Portugal's interest won't matter too much as long as his own interest surpases it
"Oof, that's insane. I get that Asia is way more massive than Europe, and so travel times must suck, but still..."
"Even before PIF, Saudi clubs were best of the best in AFC"
"I used to wake up at midnight for European games. Now I need to do this even for AFC, like what "
"Not really, Al-Hilal is the only Saudi team to win it in the past 20 years. They weren't outperforming Korean and Japanese teams."
"Ugh sure then bud.

Saudi clubs are the best. The best clubs there were and are. There are no clubs in Asia more excellent than the Saudis."
It wasn't that time
"Yeah even now its still Korea with the most titles (12) followed by Japan with 8, Saudi clubs were definitely not the best of the best lmao"
"Yes, South Korea is pretty good no doubt, but Saudi clubs reached finals 16 times higher than Japan, and the team with highest wins in Al Hilal. So technically, Saudi clubs are one of the best in Asia even before PIF."

"Bundesliga, all hits no miss"
Dortmunds hope for international football next season stays alive
"I need to see a goalkeeper cam, I think he really was hurt badly because he had all the time in the world to get back in goal but couldn't"
This Team gonna kill some fans 4 sure.
No fucking way
Never unclench with this Dortmund lmao
"Too obvious that Hoffenheim was gonna concede again, their defense is hot garbage"
Duality of a man.
what a rollercoaster of emotions in the last 10 mins
feels like eternity since the last Dortmund late winner
Damn match day went crazy
Bundesliga games are quite fun
This league is ridiculous
That was a foul tho
What a fucking game! Europe here we come!
Dortmund is so hot and cold its insane. I feel for their fans JFC. GG!
"Baumann looks concussed, that's a bad call."
"Nah you know what actually the keeper could barely walk, that's a bit unfair"
Lol there is no way that should have been allowed
How can you give that goal? Goalkeeper gets taken out by Chukwuemeka who doesnt even touch the ball.
Why does this even get checked
GK palms the ball away and gets cleaned out. No foul. That's scandalous.
How does that count??
holy what are these matches today thats nuts
Ridiculous to allow this goal after the GK got kneed to the head.
Last minute goal
That goal standing is absolutely mind boggeling. No one will care because it's only Hoffenheim but this decision is absolutely wild.
"I’m not sure how this goal was given tbh, and I want Dortmund to win as much as the next person. Chukwuemeka kicked Baumann in the face, inadvertently but even so…"
Absolute fucken disgusting decision and how is he allowed to play on
Niemals ein Tor
Goalkeeper got a concussion but definitely no foul here...
"I mean you absolutely cannot give that when the goalkeeper is visibly stumbling back to his spot because of contact to the head. It could even be 50-50 and you still have to stop that, even it means having the keeper subbed off."
1st touch matters
"really what is the point of the VAR, this is absolutely a foul on the keeper"
Thank you Stuttgart
Never again do I want to hear Dortmund fans complain about the ref lmao
"thats a foul on the keeper clearly, should be always cautious with head injuries"
No goal for me. The Dortmund player saw the keeper and still was going with the legs for the ball. Was a reckless play for me.
Fucking love this league
Looking at the remaining games it wouldn't surprise me at all if they made it into CL. Both Leipzig and us have quite a hefty set of games left
"Bauman died for it, though :("
Never in doubt 🤢
Yeah he got hit by the Dortmund player's knee
Yeah he looked pretty out of it
He was trying to run back to goal like a zombie
Is that boss music I hear
Both Dive for the ball Normal collision
if he dives for the ball he needs to play the ball before the attacker to get a foul there 10/10 times. And they play it the same time
Doesnt look like a bad call. Just looks like why being a keeper requires an insane mfer
"Also the way he's holding his neck seems like the whiplash was crazy. My team wins and I don't feel good about it, how does BVB do this everytime to me"
It was a 50-50 and he took the risk to get hit by his foot
"He wasn’t kicked in the face, it was when the GK stopped the attackers foot so his knee bent and landed on the GK head as he was tripped"
"both go for the ball, touch it at exactly the same time. 

At that point getting hit is a risk the keeper takes when diving for the ball. 

Can't take a win away for the keeper being .2 seconds too late to clear the ball first"
One 50/50 goes our way and that makes up for years of absolute disasters from referees?
"Joke of a comment when there are countless of moments both in the champions league and Bundesliga of refs being disgraceful in favour of our opponents.

Also, while baumann did get hit in the end, during the play both chuk and baumann touched the ball at the same time, the collision occurred afterwards due to the keeper diving towards the action which is a risk that keepers take."
7 points to go...
"If Anton didnt convert the chance it should have been penalty. I cant post X links for some fucking reason, but there is an ultra slow motion of Baumann not touching the ball at all and only going for Chukuwumekas feet, then he stumbles in Baumanns face.

Just because someone got injured while doing the foul, doesnt mean its not his fault. 



His x handle is: CROVEK23, he replied to another german journalist if you wanna have a look yourself."
"That's a bit unfair to him tbf I'd give a foul there, a knee to the fucking face is a foul lol"
"Yeah, VAR should be all over that."
Whoever gets to the ball first is right. Most fouls are people being late to a tackle lol
"You can say it about most leg breakers.
The attacker got his head and not the ball."
I haven't seen a single replay where the Dortmund player touched the ball but maybe I'm blind
"Yeah true, go score more offsite goals that don't get called back to then proceed to still cry about the ref. This is jus the tip of the iceberg with Dortmund as well."
Only 4 points now with the win.
What do you mean?
"Not at all? How is Chukuwumeka able to play the ball backwards while reaching out with tight food in the direction of the corner?

He must have blocked the ball in way prior to the collision?!"
"I watched it and it shows the exact same that the non-slowmo clip showed. Baumann hits the ball with his left hand's lower wrist and then clips Chuckys foot. He is clearly first and it's not even possible to see whether Chucky even touches the ball.

No idea what else you are seeing there."
It's not always knee to face. Sometimes it's face to knee.
"It's also only a knee to the face because Baumann hits Chuks leg, which makes it bend, hence knee hit his face. It looked nasty though."
"Nah, I really don't like Dortmund, but this is just a standard clash. The dortmund player doesnt aim to hit the keeper, it's just a little bit unlucky. 100% goal in my book."
"nope. Both touched the ball at exactly the same time. At that point not a foul. The keeper dives into the leg, if he does not play the ball first thats a risk he takes"
sure. But you can see in the slow mo they touch it the same time.
It definitely looks like Chuk gets a slight touch on the ball too tho so I do think it's a play on
"He got the ball too then got swept by the ensuing tackle and fell on his head. I am for sure biased, but goalkeepers are protected enough"
"I mean, I don't have a still of both touching, it looked very typical though. With how Baumann dived for the ball I would not expect it to go towards the penalty spot unless the Dortmund player also touches it."
Butthurt bremen fan lmao
"Well, yeah, but we still have to play Leverkusen. I'm counting on 55 points being enough for us."
I think 55 points will be enough to reach 4th place with us having the better goal difference. But that also relies on the other games going in our favor.
"Just watch the video sir.

Basically Baumann is just tripping Chuku, while the ball (from Guirassy) just stops at Baumanns elbows/underarm, so none of them touch them ball.  But that ball contact was after Baumann fucked up Chukus feet, with his hand. So it would be penalty and yellow card Baumann."
Yeah but idk. I really don't like this goal as a fan.
"Honestly he still should look at it and that's the biggest problem with VAR / refs these days.

The action was a full 50/50 so I wouldn't swap with the ref but the aftermath of it being Baumann literally having a huge blast on his forehead as well as looking slightly affected and maybe even really shortly being knocked out, it should have been called off.

Yes even if there is no foul simply because of a possible dangerous head injury as this should overwrite everything else as intention doesn't apply here (which is also why often called fouls don't get any cards)

There would be less talk about it if well the ref at least looks into it on the screen."
Is that really the rule? I thought it’s a clear foul as a dortmund fan. I’ll take it tho
"touching the ball does not mean its not a foul 

you are full of shit"
Ah ok I see what you mean. Ideally Bayern has the title wrapped up next week and leverkusen has less to play for but that will be our toughest game for sure.
Would Kovač keep his job in that case? Would you like him to stay?
Watched it now. Perspective is not the best but it is impossible for the ball to change direction like that without hitting Baumann.
"What difference does the on-pitch referee going over to watch it on the screen make when VAR has already checked it and determined it wasn't a foul?

Like at that point you're simply stopping the game to *make it look* like something is happening, which is utterly pointless."
"ref was in communication with VAR for minutes. 

As it basically comes down to who touches the ball first, thats easily sth the VAR can handle themselves"
Screen time when the VAR already told the ref it wasnt a foul? Why we should have that. People would complain about the VAR in such cases.
"who gets injured by which action doesn't matter for fouls. Only coming in late (not getting the ball) and/or reckless behavior. In other words, it's about the kind of action and not about the results of those actions.

Chukwuemeka's actions were not reckless just because Baumann was injured, it was simply unfortunate."
"Nope, but I can see that the VAR doesn\`t see a clear mistake here and doesn\`t intervene."
"I mean, he takes a risk. can't really punish the attacker for that. If Baumann jumps in leg first and they hit each other with similar timing noone talks about it"
How? The sliding keeper trying to play the ball tripped up the attacker. If the keeper got their first it's a foul but if he didn't you don't get a foul just because the attacker's hit the keepers head near the ground after.
"If the keeper managed to touch the ball with both hands then yes, it would have been considered a foul but this was simply a 50/50. Unfortunately for Baumann he didn't get any of the ball with his hands"
"how is it a foul if the goalkeeper dives towards the ball, head down and right into the shooting motion of the striker? 

That only becomes a foul if he clears the ball first and is still hit. 

Cannot punish the striker for going after the ball"
"His contract is through the end of next season regardless, and personally I'm good with that."
Its likely the case yes. And he'd get a summerwindow of backing to prove himself before we extend him further. A bit risky and reactionairy but the manager market seem rough this summer
"True I’ve seen this exact foul given countless times, so I guess it’s up to the ref"
"The rule is also that the ref should take a break for head injuries, and watching Baumann stumble through the box isn't a good look."
Imagine the scenes if he suspends play while Dortmund have a shot on the empty goal. Dortmund fans would riot
how can the ref see if its a head injury? the ball woudl either go in or anton misses and then he can stop. Imagine he interrupts that play because of that. The ref could never whistle a dortmund match. rightfully though
"And how is the ref supposed to tell that in real time with His POV? He saw the clash signaled that its not foul (which IS the right call) the ball is free, and Baumann back on his feet(!) The ball is played to the others side of the pitch and shot at the goal, so ofc thats where the ref has his eyes. All of this within 5 seconds. Cant blame the ref here. How is he supposed to know?"
"There's only seven professionals in Biel/Bienne's squad.

This is like Andorra beating Germany and making it to a final."
"YB equalises with the last kick of the game. 

But goal is disallowed!!!!"
"If they meet Basel, does it mean they will get a qualification spot for EL?"
who tf cares
"sadly not. only the winner gets a EL qualification spot. 

The spot gets passed onto the next best team in the league rather than to the loser of the final."
"Who tf comments on something  just to tell others how they don't care about it lmao

that's the real question here"
You apparently.
"There are 50 posts here every minute, you 're gonna comment this on every post you don't find interesting?"
It's more interesting than most every day premier league games for example
Ah. Lets hope they pull it off then. A real life FM story

To do that when you're already on a yellow card is absolutely braindead defending. Absolute moron
This is going to ruin the relegation battle
Any chance you have the a clip of the first yellow card plz? I can't find a post for one
So many fucking red cards this season.
Bro had shit to do today. Couldn't just hang around playing footy all day
"Smirking whilst he is walking off, absolute bellend."
Stupid to do that when your already on a yellow
Is he smiling while walking off….
"Stupid cunt, gets skinned and looses his head already on a yellow."
"Just don't wrap your arms around players like you're about to German Suplex them, it's pretty fucking easy honestly"
"lol at McKenna’s reaction -“yup, so that’s it then”"
Idiot. Enjoy the championship
"Honestly, the first yellow he received was a soft one. It wasn’t a simulation worthy yellow even though he did try to make the most of it"
"First card was trash, this ref has lost control of this first half."
This is really criminal. Just because you're relagated already doesn't mean you must act like a douchebag.  Scumbag.
Those bri'ish accents...
"First one was for a dive too, add spice to the idiocy."
What relegation battle?
Isn’t the relegation battle already over? Lol
"It was for simulation. Burns stuck a leg out right outside Newcastle’s penalty box and Johnson jumped over it, maybe a little dramatically."
"Not surprised, got paid to do fuck all for a whole season."
"He was walking towards the manager, so there might have been an exchange between them. "
Feet up for the rest of the season
Just shows the lack of quality and football brain. Swear it's happened for the last like 4 weeks as well 😂
First card was exactly the kind of card I'd like to see more of. Fkin hate divers!
What? It was a dive
"Relax man, it was a tactical foul. Not very tactical, more braindead because he was on a yellow, but nothing malicious"
"Oh calm down you're acting like he's two footed him.

Dumb second yellow though."
"You're a sausage, and not even a good one."
"Watches British football

People have British accents 🤯"
Scottish to be precise
"If his first yellow was a dive, the foul by enciso was also a dive. Joke refereeing"
The first division relegation battle
"Yeah, was just jesting"
But I feel the relegation war is just about to begin. 
battle for who can be the most relegated
"Yeah, I saw it live, I'd like to have another look at it"
"It wasn’t even an egregious dive or something, he fell over pulling out of a tackle. Unless you want footballers to run full speed and clatter knee to knee on clumsy legs being left out, refs should just wave those ones off and play on"
If they gave this card consistently matches would finish keeper v. keeper. It was as much of a dive as the one just given for a penalty.
"It really wasn’t lol. Watch the replay. Burns clearly sticks out a big leg and Johnson is jumping to avoid it. You don’t have to make contact for it to be a foul. Burns 100% impedes Johnson. 

The ref didn’t even pull the card out until the crowd made noise."
"As a Chelsea fan watching this, I felt disrespected really."
I didn't say it sounds bad or anything. I just can't stop being amazed every time I hear a new way to speak English in islands
"If we are bringing comparisons in, then the disallowed goal was also a dive by Palmer, so overall it has balanced out :)"
The joke was giving Delap and Burn both a yellow for pushing on eachother equally before the ball was even in play and before either had been talked to.
Begun the relegation wars have
Well they seem to be fighting for that. Lol
"He was obviously seeking the foul, stuck his leg out, and dived. Kicking out like that could also lead to injuries and is very blatant. Diving is ruining the game and should be penalised much harder imo. I want the game to be a contact sport and really dislike all this diving, exaggerating contact, rolling on the floor etc"
Or the game would clean up. No consequences for diving and exaggerating have led to this type of behaviour. Fines mean nothing to these people. Not playing means the world to them. So hit them where it hurts.
He was throwing himself before Burns even started his tackle. Obvious dive with his leg stuck out to seek contact.
Nothing wrong with appreciating an interesting accent
Indeed. VAR needs to be reformed
"It's over Anakin!  

I have the higher goal difference!!!"
"But Burn was also super late on that tackle and left his leg out right in the path he was running into. IMO it’s a no win situation, Burn’s making a challenge that would be a foul if they make contact, Johnson has limited options, that’s just the nature of the game so the ref should just say play on and move past the incident instead of dwelling on it

They’re are much worse incidents like the fake head injury or the “get tapped by a head butt so roll around like he tried to kill you” that make the game so much less enjoyable"
"I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead, every single one of them. And not just the Saints, but the Foxes and the Tractor Boys, too. They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals. I HATE THEM."

"Holy shit, what a take. Tracking that kinda pass is so difficult"
"Promo, promo, promo. Like a Hollywood movie"
Season 4's gonna be a banger
Great finish. Much deserved after that insane last second challenge to keep him from a freebie a few minutes ago
Its happening!
Shit singer
Amazing. Simply amazing.
What a fucking goal
reminds me of that vardy goal
Sob. Fuck Dai Yongge and his piss loving lackey Dayong Pang.
would be insane if they manage to make it to the prem and actually stay up.. but i think that is too far fetched now
Not surprising 
Straight to season highlight reel
Splendid ball in from James
That will probably happen in the next 5 years
Rob and Ryan will need som more investors if they get to the Championship and hope to survive tbh. They're going to need some more quality.
They were predicted to end up somewhere midtable
"not surprising, really?"
Obvious troll is obvious
Can wait to watch a few seconds of it in a years time when season 5 is out
"Yeah they need to build their roster a bit. If Rob and Ryan keep injecting the club with money, this could totally happen. What an insane thing to think about"
Yeah it’s not surprising
Yeah their owners are rich
I’m not a troll
"The thing is, they were crazy rich for the lower levels, especially the National League.

They're now getting to a point where they're not rich as far as ownership goes."
Infinite money + good management works see Birmingham City
Damn I didn't know all you needed was to spend money to be good. Let me Google man united real quick
"there is other rich owners in the league whose clubs didn't get promotion, so that alone isn't enough"
They aren't nearly as rich as many of the owners they are competing against.
Compared to other League One owners they really aren’t. Not even in the top 10 wealthiest owners in the league.
"It’s still surprising. They were expected to mount a solid midtable run after back to back, with the hopes of maybe scrapping the playoff spots. To get back to back to back was way beyond the expectations."
Ryan Reynolds just has a massive brain with many ridges. You wouldn't understand. His level of intelligence is incomprehensible to you.
"They don't even have the most expensive payroll in League 1. Yeah they have some financial advantages. But their ownership group are big fish and a tiny pond and pale in comparison even to some of the money out there in League one, let alone the championship where they will be decidedly not rich compared to other ownership groups"
Stupid it is then
That’s why they’ve already sold shares. The Allen family are billionaires and were brought in to the ownership group.
"I think they recently brought in some rich shareholders from what I remember. But yeah there's going to need to be extra cash Us. Ryan and Rob simply can't compete with some of the ownership groups in the championship. 

I will say though the unique nature of the TV show does offer some extra incentives both financial and beyond, as far as attracting Talent, and having extra revenue to spend"
Chelsea would’ve been a better example but go off
Cuh most of their players are championship level😭
Flair checks out
Idk they've both nearly spent a billion and one was just mathematically safe from relegation  and one may qualify for champions league
[Plenty of League 1 teams are worth much much more than Wrexham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_owners_of_English_football_clubs#League_One)
"Huddersfield, Barnsley, Wycombe for example"
"They are top three in wages for the league I think. But other teams owners have some crazy money, seems like they just don’t spend it"
"Transfermarkt is far from 100% accurate, but Wrexham's average player value would put them in last place in the Championship by (Oxford United at 701k euros to Wrexham's 403k euros) and they are only 9th in League One."
"Some are, a lot were league one guys when they joined. But still, even with a good squad it’s so incredibly tough to get promoted in a 24 team league over 46 games. Doing it 3 times in a row in the top 5 tiers of English football has never been done before, and there has certainly not been a lack of rich owners buying teams in the last 25 years."
Wow Mr obvious I never knew that thank you so much for this valuable information 
Wrexham's owners have made a unique situation where they draw such publicity from their side ventures of a TV show that they can attract much higher commercial deals and pay much higher wages than a club like Wrexham could normally expect. This is just ridiculously impressive ownership for pulling that off and succeeding.
Why did you ask then if you already knew the answer?
Because I pretend to be an idiot on purpose

Disastrous lost lol
"Palmer 3rd is mad tbh, love him but he's not even top 3 in our team this season. Should be Caicedo there instead of him."
laughed out loud when he said palmer
Wood plays in the Bundesliga I guess
"1. Salah
2. Wood
3. Isak
4. Gabriel
5. Mbeumo"
"What's Palmer doing there?? Even if he goes all offensive players, the likes of Rogers, Haaland and even Saka who missed a lot of games have better numbers overall."
"Ignoring defenders, non-attacking midfielders and goalkeepers in lists like these is a disease that has reached the top of football and needs to be stopped."
swap Palmer for VVD easily imho
God I forgot about that Salah pic lol
"Another top 5 list with 5 attackers. I wish more thought would go into these lists because most of the times it comes down to who has the most G+A so goalkeepers, defenders, and  defensive/central midfielders get shafted. Picking five attackers is just the easy way out."
"That take about foden being like shearer when it comes to picking an england squad has really got me thinking. 

This is lowkey the energy these guys have with palmer aswell. Blows my mind"
how can he be this clueless
r/gunners are gonna love this
Take a shot anytime Wazza says “Ermm”
"Quite spot on I would say, maybe not gibbs and have VVD there?"
Wonder if he’s ever thought about going into management.
Probably he's trying to build up his confidence
"To be fair I'm pleasantly surprised any players outside of the ""big"" clubs made the list. They usually don't when pundits are asked questions like this."
"Yes, I'd put in Cunha but he has been banned so often, not sure u can"
VVD isn't top 5 either. Caicedo would be a better choice
Idk but I’d say he definitely knows more than you 😂
None of our attacking players have been fit enough be in contention to be on this list and more defensive players rarely get recognition. Maybe if Gabi XL would have stayed fit and headed in a few more goals he would have had a chance
"If anyone should be taken out it’s Palmer, not Gibbs-White."
No wood? Why Bruno is there?
Fabregas gets another win - Como pushing for a top half of the table finish.
Yay como won

"Such a good Performance, one of the best I’ve ever seen from Palace."
Great from Palace. Were well up for it. Villa were shite.
"They were unbelievable. Blew Villa out of the water and it should’ve been more. Really hope either them or Forest win it, would be fantastic to see someone different win a trophy again"
"As a collective, r/soccer wants them to win it now!!"
Google's full member's cup final...
Good Aston villa were shit apparently 
"No, I am rooting for Forest & Wood"
"It was more Palace domination from start to finish, Villa had a few moments, but were second best the whole match. Very strange and lacklustre performance from Villa."
"I hope Palace wins it

We need someone else winning a trophy for once"
Scoreline flatters Villa. It could easily have been 6-0. Palace were by far the better team today.
"See you in the Final, fuckers. Up the Palace. AND I'M FEELING GLAD ALL OVER."
Palace has almost single handedly destroyed our season. For fuck sake.
Far from being player of the match but I feel like I have to give a shoutout for Kamada. He looked absolutely hopeless at the start of the season and here he is bossing the midfield in a semi final. Glasner kept giving him chance after another and it's paying off at the best of times
Is Oliver Glasner currently the most underrated manager?
This game could've gone on for two more hours and I'm convinced Villa wouldn't have scored
"These players just keep doing us proud. They fight like dogs for each other and the badge on the shirt and I love them for it

Can't help but believe it's our year 🔴🔵"
Palace is fun to watch and I hope they win the entire thing.
"Genuinely pathetic from the players, I don't even know what to say.

Hope one of Palace or Forrest win the whole lot."
Why do we always do so good against Villa? 4 wins and 1 draw last 5 games
"I really enjoy how direct Palace are. It feels almost like a throwback in a game that's been dominated by high lines, breaking down low blocks, like the Pep model; Palace just win the ball, run a little, and shoot. The opposition can't get set up. Top stuff. 

I look forward to Adam Clery's video on the subject."
What an insane performance by Palace. They should’ve scored at least 2 more goals.
Hot take. Adam Wharton is good at football.
Go on Palace go win the whole thing
"UP THE PALACE. We just played a blinder, completely dominated Villa."
"Please let it be Palace vs Forrest, that would be an incredible final for the fans"
Top game. Wharton rocks.
"Well, at least we're not the only side from the city to embarass ourselves at Wembley this year!

On a more serious note - it would be great to see Palace win a major trophy for the first time in their history."
Respect for having an amazing season after selling their best talent.
"Congratulations to them , their fans deserve it"
"I said before the game that if we didn't turn up and play our best we would get battered.

Fair play to Palace, they played great and had their game plan down to a tee - it was really nice of the Villa team to agree so much we wanted to help them by being absolutely garbage.

Honestly, one of our worst games of the season, and Gerrard left the club with a curse ever since he refused to sign Sarr because the lad fucking hates us"
"Spookily similar to Palace's 3-0 cup win over Fulham. Even contest until the first goal, then Palace just strangled the life out of their opponents and took their chances (both games had an Eze belter too). You don't want to be chasing a game against this team. Glasner is an excellent coach."
"Crystal Palace played so well. Aston Villa started the game too slowly. They were waiting for an opening which never came, meanwhile Crystal Palace just did everything possible to win. Mateta and Eze played very well today as well as Wharton in the midfield."
Hope palace win the whole thing. 
Come on palace
"Out of Champions League

Out of FA Cup

And they are not yet safe in playing European football next season


Tough to be a Villa fan right now"
Emery has kinda single-handedly lost them this end of the season
I had no skin in this game and Villa still disappointed me.
Villa's defending is so poor.
"Brilliant performance from Palace

Hope they go on and win it this time!

I'm sure villa fans will have loads of great memories from this season, but it's starting to feel like a real close but no cigar one in the moment."
"Crazy.

70% possession, 12 corners vs 1, more attempts and shots on target... LOSE 3-0.

Go Palace!"
Palace handled a two goal lead vs. Villa better than the overpraised PSG.
"Villa is always poor at defending but today they were bad at attacking too.

It's like the entire squad went into the pitch with the sole intention of waiting out a loss. Could've played another 90 minutes like that and still wouldn't have scored.

Not even the fans were trying. Just awful. I think it'll be Conference League for them next year."
"Unai Emery keeps failing in the big matches at Villa.  Whether it's the PSG tie overall, Olympiacos twice last year or this game.  Congratulations Palace."
Guys were saying Glasner and Wharton hype was dead when he lost his best player and Wharton was fighting a groin injury early this season 😂
"Congratulations to Palace. You were excellent again. You have our number. Go win the damn thing, you deserve it. 

We just looked awful today bar a few moments from McGinn, Tielemans, and Kamara. 

Gotta push on in the league now. Seasons lost a lot of steam in less than 2 weeks"
Would love for Palace to go on and win the thing. Their first ever major trophy! Long overdue.
Palace were fantastic. Villa were disappointing. Bring on tomorrow.
"Completely dominated, should have been more, Glasner totally sussed them out. 

Palace's midfield and front 3 looked incredible though, so much fitter, faster, stronger."
Did that man just steal the shirt from that old man at the end?
"Fucking disgusting for a team to show up and play like that in the semi final of a cup that we had a chance at actually winning. I'm actually so mad and disappointed about what I just watched. 2/10 performances for everyone would be generous other than for Bailey and Maatsen who actually tried and treated the game like it should have been treated. Take nothing away from Palace though, phenomenal performance by them. Glasner has dog walked Emery every time we've played them this season. If City beat Forest, I hope Palace win the lot. If it's Forest they play, I'd be happy with either winner."
Wharton looks a real player
"Them fucking Hawks played well. The best compliment I can give is that they made Morgan Rogers look fucking awful and he is usually an absolute stallion of a player. Wharton was snapping at his heels all game, didn’t allow Rogers to roll a player and charge like a rhino at defences like he normally does."
Aston Villa are literally just 2009-2012 era Tottenham
"Very unlike an Unai Emery team to completely fall apart in the matter of two weeks and be out of everything, really gutted."
"Marcus Rashford Several Weeks Out - Hamstring Injury

[https://www.premierleagueinjuries.com/3792-marcus-rashford](https://www.premierleagueinjuries.com/3792-marcus-rashford)"
Villa were dreadful
Enjoyed the game.
Emery the minute that there’s any expectations 💔💔💔
"What do I do if my erection isn't going down?

I'm so proud of this team."
"...Does Micah Richards think it's pronounced ""Corashious""?"
Could have scored 7
"That was absolutely awful from Villa, did they not know it's a SF lol"
"29 years and counting… tick tock ya Villa pricks

Prince William can get fucked too. Abolish the monarchy."
30 years and no trophy for Villa has to sting
"Only one team and set of fans turned up, bit like us in the Carabao"
Aston Villa have now gone 29 years without a major trophy. Pretty incredible for a club of their stature.
"Damn, only one team turned up"
Unai Emery experience.
On my mama when did Kamada become a passable player?
"As an Arsenal fan, glad Villa lost. If they won the cup we'd have to hear about it forever how Arsenal should have given Emery longer"
"Absolutely insane performance by Palance. You just love seeing Villa get destroyed like this, and so does Sarr lol he hates them. 

Eze is so fucking good to watch though, but I just hope he doesn't go to City, it would he sad to lose such an entertaining player. Shout out to Mitchell too, very good player, and imo kinda underrated"
"Villa just didn't show up 

Maybe the fatigue got to them"
that’s late stage Emery for ya
So when do we have a conversation about Emery?
"The reason I'm a united fan is that my babysitter told me I had to support a team during the FA cup final replay in '90. I always laughed about how good of a coin-flip choice that was but now I'm not so sure. My soft spot for Palace has become bigger. Best chant in the league as well. We love you, we love you, we love you..."
"Love you Palace

https://lastwonatrophy.co.uk/aston-villa/#:~:text=Aston%20Villa's%20last%20major%20silverware,Fire%20Starter%20by%20The%20Prodigy."
"Spending so much on wages and ending up outside the top 5, no trophies, is frankly hilarious"
"tbf we had Newcastle win one a couple moths back. But with their owners, it just doesnt ring the same as portsmouth or wigan"
Will be so weird as a forest fan if we actually got to the final and the other team are fan favorites because they've not won a trophy
Why not Forest? 
Agreed. I have no idea how we simultaneously played a great game and under-performed.
SAY THAT YOU LOVE ME
That's why they call us the (red and) blues
In Glasner we trust man. 
"I think we talk a lot about the pace of the premier league, but in reality, its the rhythm that catches players out and takes time."
Yeah he’s taken a lot of shit and rightly so but fucking hell was he great today
There is a good argument for it. The turn around of their form after the opening few months has been remarkable.
Just don't look at the recent league results
Damn were they that bad
Mate the team chemistry is off the fucking charts. They're all playing for each other I fucking love it man.
For a team to be there three times and lose all three would be heartbreaking.
"Pathetic is harsh as fuck. Palace fresher, took their chances, Glasner outcoached Emery again. Your players have given their all this season."
Glasner has totally figured Emery out. Proper out coaching.
"Mitchell's scuffed shot, JP's penalty, and two headers from Sarr. Could genuinely have been 7"
"If Tuchel plays him behind Rice, England might actually be able to control games in summer tournaments"
Now villa are out I can once again hope City don't win it. Palace v Forest final please!
That would be incredible!
Only by very recent standards
hahaha it's great
"They nearly got relegated a few years ago, they'll be alright"
Kinda expected with unai he did the same with vilireal just that this time villa didnt make to the semis of the cl.
"He's also spent a decent amount too. 

I don't think we should be binary in our assessments of coaches, he's clearly done a boat load of good work establishing Villa as a club in Europe with good players. 

My question would be; what's next?

I'd say a trophy represents forward momentum. The tricky part for Villa is what you do with that squad this summer. Three big money loan players—I'd say two with decisions hanging over them—and four or five players out on loan that need to find a home."
That's the classic unai feeling tbh.
Why is it exclusively his fault?
Stats don't reflect it. They were better from minute 1
"The stats did not accurately reflect the game, football is weird like that some times, palace were comfortable the whole game."
Losing to PSG 5-4 on aggregate with Villa is not in the same bracket as losing to Palace lol. If anything he exceeded expectations against PSG.
"This is such a ridiculous thing to say lol. Is it a failure for villa to lose 5-4 on aggregate to psg? 


You have seen his managerial history right? 


Honestly people say some dumb shit. "
"Bringing up the PSG game like it was Emerys fault is so ridiculous, if you actually watched the game you would know Donnarumma played one of his best games."
"admittedly from a very limited sample size it seems like Emery starts to fade as the season goes on, whereas Glasner gets stronger towards the end of the season"
"Hey, don't say that! Glasner dog walked Emery lasted season too"
"Mate, I get you're angry but your lads are just exhausted and Palace were fresher. Champs League has stretched you thin, although I think Emery could have managed your squad better (he's played Rogers into the ground, for example)"
I don't know that I heard his name all match honestly.
For the last 29 years
"I mean, hard to take anything you say seriously when we’ve played champions league football this season and Birmingham were in league 1…"
They came from championship 5 seasons ago. They just played PSG. They are in fight for back to back champions league participation. Don’t see what’s to sting
Palace have no trophies of note in their history.
Not a single yippee-ki-yay in the second half
You only have stature if you're winning trophies.
"To be fair we’ve gone our entire history without one. Just need Forest to do a number on City now, can’t face another final with anything Manchester related."
Fantastic isn’t it.
He's been steadily getting better for months. Hes had a few MotM performances recently too
"Also makes people who criticised Arsenal for drawing against ""lowly"" Palace look not so clever."
"Haven't seen anything linking us with Eze and don't see why we'd be in for him, big price and not particularly an upgrade for us (as good as he is)."
"No. Villa had 16 shot attempts and 5 on target. They had the majority of possession and legit could have scored a couple. But our defense kept it cool in the box and Henderson had a few great saves. Our chance creation on the break was better. Sometimes a team gets beaten, even when they do show up."
That’s what i felt as well
"Death, taxes, arsenal fans commenting this dumb shit after every Villa loss... 

Guaranteed"
Kinda like arteta?
Always the managers fault lol. Crazy take. Did you even watch the game or just blindly hate Emery?
"Yes let's all get round a table and agree he's doing a great job at Villa, riveting stuff."
oh grow up lol
What is there to talk about ?
When you finally win in Europe.
"If I supported a fake club that exists to finish second, I'd probably shut up"
Mob boss owner and spent a fortune deliberately breaking rules. Its not the fairytale some would like you to believe.

ALL OF THE TIME
"Laughin’ like children, soarin’ like Eagles?"
honorary zulus 🤝
I don't think they care at all about the league. You can make Europe if you win the FA cup anyways so there's no point.
"What’s wrong with the recent league results? Getting battered by city and Newcastle isn’t exactly out of line for a team like us. But if you actually look at our form this calendar year, ie recently, you’ll see how good it is.

At least we didn’t get battered by Arsenal, unlike some Spanish team."
Drawing 2-2 with Arsenal and 0-0 with Bournemouth while down a man aren't terrible results. Getting battered by city and newcastle were bad looks but those are top 4 clubs right now.
Villa were genuinely awful.
It's the power of Jesus
*cough* been there done that
"There's not a single starting player out there who can be proud of their performance today. I'm not taking anything away from Palace in that statement, they were great, but we needed to step up and didn't."
Not counting the disallowed goal that should have stood?
"I said last tournament that he should be starting too. I wasn't alone in that but fully agree. He should be a starter for England, he's that good."
"I was bringing it up as it was a big game for Emery at Villa, I never said it was his fault.  I watched both games thank you very much, Donnarumma was outstanding in the second leg but in the first leg they could've won with more goals.  Overall the tie was won by the better team over both legs."
"The man has won FOUR Europa Leagues, can’t judge him just based on this"
"He knows how to get it done in the Europa League, sometimes I forget he won 3 in a row around a decade ago.  I was surprised to see him not even make the final last season in the Conference League.  Glasner done a great job, they started the season in really bad form but have turned it around massively."
"I mean, Villa had Champs League, Palace didn't. Huge difference come late April"
Villa had twice as much rest before this game
He skinned Mitchell once at the start and I was worried and then did fuck all for the rest of the game
"😂😂😂 

come back when you actually win something"
A club of their size should be winning something of note in the last 3 decades lol
Bet that stings too
Guy can’t score can’t pass but he can run for 180 minutes and I think Glasner realized that and turned him into a DM type player
There were some links a while go I think? Big price you can pay no problem and I think he'd slot in well as one of the wingers or 10. Eze can very well take KDBs spot
He’d be an upgrade on Grealish immediately
"I'm tired of the same excuses every time we play them. Since Glasner arrived, the last four Villa matches ended 5-0, 2-2, 4-1, and 3-0. That's 14 goals to 3. We played Arsenal on Wednesday. They played Tuesday. Is it maybe possible that we're just good at beating them?"
They’ll see Villa literally beat PSG at home and still in contention for UCL qualification and comment late stage Emery because he got knocked out of a cup semi final Arsenal didn’t even reach.
"Death, taxes, neutrals doing emery revisionism after every Villa win and Arsenal loss...

Guaranteed"
"Death Taxes and Villa cunts crying at Wembley…

Guaranteed"
Arsenal didn't fall away last season. Quite the reverse. Just weren't quite good enough.
The same Arteta that already won this trophy with us?
You think he's doing a great job at Villa? With the team they have?
Whether hes performing or not?
"Speaking of supporting fake clubs here's how to get your City flair,

https://reddit.com/r/soccer/w/flair?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"
And we beat brighton
Ew but yea I guess
"No, that's fair. Shame your season has petered out like this, takes the edge off somewhat"
I was v pissed off that Southgate gave him zero minutes in the Euros when it was blatantly obvious we needed a player of his profile. We lose control of matches all the time in tournaments partly because we don't seem to rate players like Carrick and Wharton
Alternatively he got knocked out of the champions league twice in a row and wouldn't even have had the opportunity to do that under a better and current system
Whats he done since those trophies?
"> He knows how to get it done in the Europa League

Not always 😒"
We genuinely ran out of steam in the Conference League and injuries were coming in and hurting us massively. That and we came up against Olympiacos who just ripped us apart.
"Disingenuous, much? You know I'm talking about the effects of the whole season"
We've played 10 more games than Palace this season. Twice as much rest isn't gonna cover an extra 900 minutes.
"Okay…I mean Villa are objectively a more successful club.

But you do you"
England has a lot of clubs of the same size though and there're only so many trophies to win
We won the Zenith Data Systems cup against Everton but no one counts that.
He played under Glasner at Frankfurt. The kamada we have seen in the past couple of games is the kamada Glasner bought at the start of the season
"The villa fans all ways go about how much better than us they are....yet time after time we thump them🤷

different systems and formations interact differently and we have Unais number."
The idiotic side of their fan base is awful in general. But they come out of the wood work whenever Villa lose a big game.
Arsenal beat PSG at home this season also. What exactly is your point?
"Emery revisionism? You don't see Villa fans doing it in your threads. Just neutrals trying to wind you up.

We were facing relegation before he showed up. 

He's got us fighting at the top end of the table and pushing deep in Europe. 

He's world class.

Who cares what happened at Arsenal anymore? It was five years ago. He's moved on, your club has moved on. It just didn't work there."
"Yup. Can't even hit back at your Wembley performance. 

We stunk the place out"
"Cmon man give some credit to Emery, most of that squad that won was his"
Yeah like 30 fuckin years ago
"I think he's done fine, but given the massive Villa investment I'd expect a trophy at least yeah"
Not a fan either lol but the togetherness of the God Squad in our side is obviously key to the team spirit
"That’s a bit harsh though, in order to not get knocked out of the Champions League you have to win it, and it’s not like the teams he was competing with would have expected to win it. 

He took Villareal to the semis and Villa to the quarters, losing to Liverpool and PSG respectively. Those are pretty great runs for both clubs."
He has more European cups than your whole club. Are you sure you want to question his methods?
Made Villa into a really good team that is fighting for champions league places on the regular?
"That's true, but can't win it every year.  No manager at Arsenal in the last 30 years has ever won anything in Europe, they have gone to the same amount of Champions League finals as Tottenham in that time period.  We will see if you guys can win the Champions League this season, otherwise the Mikel Arteta's nearly men tag will continue."
Which millennium are they more successful in? This one or the one when my grandad was in nappies?
"True but when teams like us, Swansea, Pompey have all won trophies in the same timespan they have then they should be disappointed with that"
that might be the least aweinspiring name you could have for a cup
"I’m not insulting Arsenal, I’m saying that calling it late stage emery is a tad ridiculous when Villa are doing fine. But I know people get sensitive with Arsenal in this sub so I can see why you thought it was."
I totally agree with you! I think he's a good manager and he has done great at Villa. Just get annoyed whenever Emery wins a game where he isn't expected to win there's shouts that we shouldn't have let him go
"So if one guy won it with that squad I should give credit to the guy that didnt?

Makes sense"
"Did you see Muñoz come up to Eze after his arsenal goal? Appeared to tell him to thank God for it. I'm not religious, but they do seem to be gelling on that level."
"Considering he's managed my club and did a pretty shit job of it yes, but much like your comment it's not remotely relevant"
Quite possibly the most Liverpool fan-coded response in this entire thread tbh.
Honestly with the amount of money they've spent that's doing the bare minimum
I mean…the current one where they played champions league football and Birmingham were in league 1?
I don't disagree there
It's Emery the OP was criticising anyway. The Villa fans I'm sure are probably doing the same on the villa sub.
"Nah, you should have. It wasn't working and he didn't have control of the dressing room. 

In another universe maybe it would have worked out, but it didn't and Arteta is the right guy."
"Meeting the expectations of your spend is a lot better than a lot of other teams in the league to be fair... 

I'm not sure what people expect. They overperformed in Europe, they are doing as expected in the league, a cup semi is good but obviously disappointing to get knocked out by palace. They are clearly impacted by the amount of matches they have played. 

We see it so often with teams that don't traditionally get top 4, that they suffer the year after, villa really aren't doing as badly as people are trying to portray here."
Warra trophy that is
Birmingham have actually won a trophy this century.
"Yeah but calling it late stage Emery is a wrong criticism. Is this anything like his final days at Arsenal, is everything crumbling currently? No."
Embarrassing behaviour haha
Millennium*
"I know…they can have it.

I still know which of the two clubs I’d rather be supporting at the end of the day, and it’s not the one down in league 1"
"He missed out on top 4 and lost the EL final (or semi, I can't remember)."
Whatever helps you cope bab. Hope your train home breaks down x
Irish and supporting a Tory Royalist club. Big oooft.
No I’m on about the 19/20 season when he got sacked.
"What, I need to explain myself to you and my family connection and history in Aston?

Surely you know that Irish emigration to areas around Aston and Digbeth was huge?

Also claiming villa to be a Tory club is hilarious.

Have you ever actually been to Aston?"
That was halfway through. He was sacked partially because of that preceding season.
The Trainerroulette is very strange in the 2nd Bundesliga
"I don't understand why, he literally got them promoted twice in a row. Their squad is just pretty crap for 2. Bundesliga standards. I think they will get relegated either way, maybe reach 16th place."
"Fuck Kittner, Nepo baby"
"That's harsh, recent results might not have been great but that includes draws against Karlsruhe and Darmstadt, and defeats against Fortuna and Köln. With their squad it's not like they could expect much more from those. They could still finish in 16th (match against Ulm on the final day to decide who goes down lol) and maybe stay up in the relegation playoff."

That's some way to score your first goal for the club
[Great Goal] tag where
"Another weekend, another loss."
That’s a banger
"One day one of these had to go in, and by God it’s a banger"
Top corner banger. Fair play
"Week after week we just sit back and let teams do this to us, pathetic"
"Great goal. Though if not for having 3 teams much worse this time, West ham would have been in relegation race. "
I hate this club
So um when does next season start?
Him and Bergvall on our midfield for the future is so exciting!
Followed him since his AIK days. What a way to score your first goal for the club.
Is Wieffer playing right back? What happened?
Brighton seem to have new players every game week. 
Areola is turning into Joe ~~Joke~~ Hart with the amount of screamers flying past him combined with the odd look of confusion on his face
Can't hit it any better than that
"There's been some brilliant goals scored so far this month. Off the top of my head we've had Murphy vs Palace, Mateta vs Arsenal, Eze vs Arsenal, Mac Allister vs Fulham, Onana vs Newcastle, Neto vs Fulham, Sancho vs Ipswich, Trent vs Leicester, Ait Nouri vs Spurs, KDB vs Palace and now this (I might be missing a few more)

We still have three games left this month tomorrow so we might end up with a few more bangers as well. Regardless, this is going to be a great goal of the month compilation"
"Churning out a new wonderkid every other week who promptly scores a banger, glad my Brighton is back."
Have you seen our defending
All you need is Bowen vs Dunk in a fast break dw
Are you looking forward to relegation?
Not to mention Larsson. Even Cajuste is a solid midfielder
him and WHOM??
"Injuries to Lamptey and Veltman (although both available on the bench today) and, of the two, Hurzeler seems to prefer Hinshelwood in CM and Wieffer at the back"
"Right back and Left back are our most cursed positions, there’s always an injury crisis going on for one side, and sometimes both"
So far he looks class at RB today he's been one of the best he's class except for looking nervous in final third was it like that at feyenord?
It’s mostly because we have an odd number of players who couldn’t score to save their lives then always pull out either a banger or a winner for their first goal of the season
Ayari is not a new player. We’ve had a pretty consistent group of players
Welp add another to the list.  Baleba goal. Lol
Have you seen our attacking?
Have you seen ours and our attack
.............yes
They need to get past Saletros first
"I like Wieffer at RB, because it hid his weakness and he can contribute on the right side defensively. Hinshelwood at DM is more consistent this season."
"I ain't complaining lol. We need more screamers and admittedly Liverpool are one of the worst when it comes to a lack of bangers. When I started watching football around 2007 we would reliably get several bangers every month if not week. Liverpool had the likes of Gerrard, Agger and Riise who would score from distance and make it look piss easy"
Not easy to get past the GOAT
He has blackmail on Jon or something because he looks dire out there
makes sense
"I feel like a lot of that has been coached out in the modern game,  players less likely to take risks or go for long shots."
Lol Saletros has been solid so far. Question is how he fares against better opponents.
Exactly but it feels particularly bad in recent years. They were still fairly common in the 2010's but they started to drop off a cliff at the start of the decade

They're on some Joga Bonito juice tonight wtf
"What a pass, what a goal

Mikautadze got in 50 seconds before and it was his 3rd touch, with 2 passes to Cherki"
"Olalala, joga bonito made in 69 ! What a beauty."
Damn Rennes suck
Second goal that should have been disallowed for Lyon tonight.
That was beautifully played
For what? What was the first?
We had 3 goals disallowed and Almada litterally gave you the only one you scored. And you say you needed a 4th disallowed goal. Come on be serious mate.
"The ball was out early in the build up on the first one (VAR check missed it) and there was a foul on Gomez (elbow) in the build up of the fourth one. Not that we deserve anything anyway, but just to mention that sometimes ref goes your way."
"It wasn't out though, do you have an angle showing it was out? I haven't seen one with all the replays they showed."
"> VAR check missed it

The VAR check literally lasted 5minutes just to check this. What do you think they were checking during this time ?"
[this](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7df9b3ba55d4fcbc1566be07085b0ebfc6bb713e/0_0_2836_1702/master/2836.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=bf7238c98ec4681e03c1ac6c2b38862a) was dubbed as not out but people can confidently state that the ball was out of play on the first goal with the replays they've been given ?
"No I don't and I will put exactly the same effort in finding one that Rennes did to winning this game, meaning 0."
Beye's game plan
"Replays can be really confusing indeed, I thought Maitland-Niles was black /s"
So you're just yapping huh
"Sure, let's say so. That's 4-4 on aggregrate this season, good luck for the final sprint and see you next year."
Set my boy dele free
Gateshead - Truro City might be the longest away league trip in English history.
"If Torquay scored 2 more goals, they would have been level with Truro on points, goals scored, goals conceded and goal difference 

What's the next tiebreaker?"
"Absolute madness, Torquay and Truro both absolutely determined to win on GD, imagine winning 4-1 away and that not being enough to guarantee promotion on GD."
Some nice long away days for them next season.
"Truro to Carlisle is about the same distance as Truro to Paris btw, mental away slog"
It was actually insane how close the top of the NLS table was
"As someone who doesn't know that much about English football and England in general, what's the reason Cornwall never had a team play in the National League (or higher) before?"
Carlisle v Truro will be a league game next year my word
"Truro were tipped as favourites to get relegated by the way. Incredible achievement! Next season will be very tough to stay up especially with the travel, but anything is possible!"
Man what a great feeling that must be for them...congrats
"Closest away game will be Yeovil, a 2 and a half hour drive away"
Good for them.
Cornish pasty time.
Pasties for everyone!
Cornish Pixies?
"I was in Newcastle 2 weeks ago and live just outside Truro, was a lovely 9 hour drive lol"
At least Gateshead is near a large airport.
Gateshead fan here. I am doing this away day no matter what.
"When I lived in the south west, Truro were viewed as being a bit of an outlier among Cornish clubs because they were competitive at a higher level - no idea if it's changed but a lot of the other clubs tended to refuse promotion because travelling further than somewhere like Bristol on a regular basis would have crippled them financially.


So it will be interesting to see how Truro are able to cope with national travel."
Falls Count Anywhere match
Wins I think
Number of wins (which truro lead by 1)
Matches won
"Truro won 5-2, Torquay won 4-1, Eastbourne won 3-0 and Worthing won 5-1

All the top 4 did the best they could to compete for 1st place!"
"Classic Torquay, always showing up at the end of the season. Still like our chances of getting back to the real national league this year. Never giving up on the League 2 dream."
"I live near Torquay these days, just further south along the coast, and even I can't be arsed going into Cornwall. It might as well be the end of the Earth. Just looked, their shortest away day this season would've been Torquay and it would take 1:51 to get there right now. Just bonkers away travel."
"As a county, small population, less money, no big teams as such.

Truro are pushing. And it’s needed for Cornwall as a whole."
"Not the only reason, but it’s a big Rugby area. Rugby Union is probably the most popular sport there, unlike football in much of the rest of the country

Same applies to the wider South West area which does have significantly less major football clubs than the rest of the country"
"And Gateshead-Truro, and Hartlepool-Truro"
"It will be really interesting to see how they get on. Speaking from experience as an Ebbsfleet fan, the National League is really, really tough these days - even after one of the greatest NLS seasons of all-time it was subsequently shown that literally none of our squad were good enough for the National League."
"We have the best footy scran going, half time pasty goes so hard"
"I'd go Gateshead away, we can grab an loganair from Newquay I think now"
Or you can take the Cross country from Truro to Newcastle
Unless you guys win the playoffs.
Ladder match surely
Playoffs should be cracking as well.
"Compared to where you were 12 months ago it's like a different club, proper community club."
"It's a beast getting out of Cornwall too, if I'm on the train past Plymouth it means I'm going to London. No in-between"
"Once had to get to Truro from the Yeovil area and it was a massive ball ache via train, with the amount of delays, cancellations etc, and driving isn’t much better. Just takes ages. That’s going to be their closest away day."
"I thought about the population factor as well at first, but then checked the list of English counties, and some less-populated counties than Cornwall had clubs in the National League (or higher before), such as Cumbria, Shropshire, Herefordshire or Bristol, which is why I guessed there were other reasons as well.

Another user mentioned that it's mainly a rugby area, that and the ""less money"" part do explain why Cornwall seems weak in football"
"The fact the closest professional academies are an hour or more away doesn't help, real challenge for parents to justify the amount of travel just to give their kids a marginally better chance of becoming a pro."
"I see. That makes sense, considering that I just quickly checked a map and it looks like there are very few clubs from the South West area in the Premier League and the EFL.

So I guess Cornwall must be pretty good at rugby then?"
Logan air flights are mad expensive sadly. I wish Flybe was still around
Just checked the Saturday timetable and it looks like there's a direct train leaving Truro at 7am that gets into Newcastle at 4.30pm - just in time for the final whistle. Only £140 each way too.
"There's not enough room on that bloody train on a normal day, imagine adding maybe a 100 football fans, be a nightmare"
"Have you seen our form? We’re not getting them, let alone winning them."
Watch maidstone win it after being miles behind everyone else
_Maidstone swerve everyone and steal it_
"> some less-populated counties than Cornwall had clubs in the National League (or higher before), such as Cumbria, Shropshire, Herefordshire or Bristol

Well sure, but the empty bits of those counties haven't really had league sides either. Places like Carlisle/Hereford/Shrewsbury have populations of 60,000-80,000, and Bristol is a city of half a million people.

Cornwall's population is much more spread out, so even the biggest towns only have about 25,000 people. Add in its remoteness - in general, but also specifically from English football's traditional heartlands - and it's not all that surprising."
"We've won the Union County Cup a number of times in the last handful of years, yes"
I think even if it's spenny I'd do it for the culture
"For all the grief about flying for domestic trips in the UK, the trains sure don't make it fucking easy to avoid"
Won't the league just stop you from participating again anyway?
That actually makes sense and shows how clueless I am about English counties haha.
That’s been cleared up now. We can play in the playoffs if we qualify.
"The remoteness is a big one. Arguably the most remote club in the EFL is Barrow, and they train in Manchester to counter that, but are also not that far from the likes of Morecambe, Carlisle, Fleetwood and Blackpool, so still have a good catchment area for professional players.


Cornwall only really have Exeter and Plymouth nearby as professional clubs to sign players from - potentially the Bristol clubs too, but that's a three-hour drive from Cornwall, and there are plenty of clubs in between like Weston and Torquay that they would be competing for signatures with."

Not a single dull day with Spanish Football
Game’s so back
Wtf I'm a Celta Vigo fan now
"FT BAR:0 - 1 CEL
Iago Aspas 90+3'

Nah screw that I dont want a nightmare can Madrid please play the final😭"
An anagram of Real Madrid is Riled Drama.
Celta Cinema
Game not gone
Based shithousery
Legendary jerk by Celta

"Threatening not to play is so funny lmaooo ""stay in yo line or we'll lose 3-0 🤫🤫🤫"""
Always rated Celta
Tbf Borja Iglesias has scored more goals against Barca than Madrid has this season
"Deserved tbh, this is ridicilous"
"Celta were robbed in their game against Real Mardid, but you didn't see RMTV post about it."
Every club should just start taking the piss out of Real Madrid now. They are pathetic.
Madrid shitshow and crying it's so funny.
Tbh Celta would be a tougher opponent than Real at the moment. Those folks are too busy creating distractions
"Celta always turn up against Barca too, may even be a harder matchup than Madrid in their current form"
"RM is such a joke of a club, won so many UCL in the last years with the mistakes of the referees, even this season, wkth Mbbape and now they have the balls to make a video with a referees mistakes 2 days before the final, unbelievable."
MASTERCLASS
Love seeing all these other clubs taking the piss out of those crybabies
While I would prefer our board to not be fucking embarrassing and act like petulant 5 year olds if other teams take the chance to create peak banter I am not even mad
"Honestly, we deserved to be mocked."
"Honestly, all of the social media interns from all the clubs should just follow in their footsteps, even from outside of Spain. 

The opportunity to just meme on Real Madrid and their stupidity, as well as score some internet cookie points... that stuff doesn't happen often."
Great banter. They'd give us much more competition than Madrid
Absolute cinema
Give their social team a raise
Okay now thats top tier shithousery
ffs real madrid is pathetic
And they took that personally. Official statement from Madrid incoming.
I neeeeeeed moooooooreeee
I'm a Celta Vigo fan now
lmao fair play
Real Clwondrid 🤡🤡
I can’t stop laughing
Celta's shithousery is always top level.
Top tier banter lol
this is amazing
"I'm okay with this, lol"
Top tier trolling
"Celts vigo talking shit, I love it."
Epic trolling is EPIC!!!
The only thing that could make this game even better is if Ferran shows up in a shark outfit and Lahoz turns up in the last minute to make a sliding tackle to make the game all about him 
Cheeky not gonna lie.
Always rated Celta. What a joke of a club Real Madrid is.
"Considering how fucking robbed Celta was on their cup match, I'd say this is fair enough."
this shit is ridiculous
At least they'd give some tough competition to Barca than us.
"I feel like whenever Barca or Madrid make an absolute buffoon of themselves, other Spanish clubs are always happy to take the piss at their expense lol"
Peak shithousery
Social Media team W ngl
The circlejerk sub is leaking!!! Lmaoooo
Real Madrid threatening not to play just to not get battered by Barcelona 5-1 or some shit like that is hilarious.
"Lol

Liga worst than Game of Thrones!!!"
It would be a more competitive match tbh.
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO
Brilliant 😂
"okay, 
atleast our club is becoming entertainment hub now.
I still don't understand why they even posted the 1st video about the ref 😂😭 
EL classico drama at it's peak 🤌
i mean like just wow 😂😭😭"
Clown madrid
Shouldn't it be Real Sociedad?
Wouldn't Sociedad be the one who could replace Real Madrid?
"We have the best CM in the world, it's that simple hahahahaha"
"I totally forgot Mingueza existed tbh, and he’s like, what, 2 years removed from being on Barca?"
RM crying about referees is fucking rich.
Celta everyone’s  team now
I missed the latest today. What's happening with Madrid? Why are they crying now?
"Not defending shit because I couldn't care less, just commenting on how funny it is everyone and their mother shits on referees on the daily and the moment Madrid does they are crybabies and a joke of a club. My god Xavi used to cry everyday even for how the grass was cut lol 

As I said I can't give many fucks but you lot are so incoherent"
This sub really hates Real Madrid. Lol.
The Telenovella we always asked for
Basically school yard football squabbles but with millions on the line
"No es football, es La Liga."
Apart from when they play football
It would be so incredibly funny if they put Celta in the final now to make a point. Like a Denmark Euros win but on steroids (without the ethnic cleansing)
Why RM has become this soft? Lol
Every single league seems so boring in front of la Liga. Imagine any of the teams from premier league using a platform to publicly bully refs and the ref holding a press conference saying match day is gonna be historic or some shit. Absolute cinema
"fucking entertaining team as well, glass cannon"
You would think they’re one of the best clubs in the world if you only watched their games against us
Welcome to the club
You're welcome!
Anagram of `Florentino Perez` is `Inept Zero Elon Ref`. Make of it what you will
r/usernamechecksout
It's in the DNA 🧬
Based on the clasicos this season they should gladly take a 3-0 loss to avoid being embarassed
"Barca TV probably did, they like to cry on behalf of Real’s opponents."
Real Madrid’s looking more like a shadow of their former self lately. Clubs should definitely capitalize on that
Crynicius has infected the club
fucking Iago Aspas will score a hattrick in 2070. dude has more goals against Barca than Cristiano
Lol says a united fan. Irony
"I know right? We deserve a second chance. Although Barcelona might prefer to play against Madrid, with this season results xD"
First come first serve.
It’s funnier coming from them because we robbed them to make it to this final
Stop giving everyone so many reasons to
Soccer has always been telenovella for men
What do you mean? The drama during the games are some of the most entertaining
Reschedule the final to be Barca vs Sociedad (who lost to Madrid in the semifinal) on a later date. Then Barca gets less schedule congestion and Sociedad gets to compete for a title. Everyone wins.
Why would they put Celta Vigo and not Real Sociedad
"I do like a decision without any ethnic cleansing, much preferred."
What do Denmark and the Euros have to do with ethnic cleansing
Ethnic cleansing?
They have always been like this at least through out perez's leadership.
Because they stopped winning
"as an english person i cant belive how embarrassing real madrid are, i think i could be born and raised in madrid and never find the strength to support them, pathetic baby fanbase and club."
"I invite you to join us as fans of the Greek Super League for a real telenovela league. The football is…passable, but the drama is palpable. I have more fun following Greek football than any other league."
"Say what you will about la Liga, but Clubs ran like this are a lot more entertaining than glorified oil advertisements like the Premier."
"Serie a isn't the same without mental Italians running the clubs. 

Inserting one or two foreign owners is funny since they just couldn't comprehend the shit these guys said"
I don't know what it means but its provocative 
"What do you even know about Barca TV lmao, you are a american who doesnt even get to see Real Madrid TV either"
They really don’t lmao
Need them to do something really stupid in the next 4 weeks please
That man is the bane of our existence. CR is easier to play against
He lives to make us sad
Understandable
Telenovela*
ain’t called pageantry for nuthin
*Pro Wrestling
Because Real Sociedad didn't do a squad announcement
"Because we were eliminated from the Copa del Rey by Madrid thanks to some legitimately atrocious refereeing in their favor (no, they didn't complain about it or made a RMTV doc on the issue)."
what if they played against each other to decide who takes their spot?
"Funny, innit?"
People like you are why the game's gone soft.
Imagine a world without Madridistas though.
Denmark got into the Euros in 1992 because of the collapse of Yugoslavia
"How can you wib everything and still be the biggest victims? 

Maybe spend the millions you make on competent defenders instead of LW or act like your clubs name means something"
That's why rayo vallencano exist. The leftists surrounded by the francoists
To be fair most Spurs fans would prefer to follow the Greek super league this season.
May I add Turkish football to the mix?
The clubs have personality
It gets the people goin
Spain doesn’t celebrate July 4th so it’s a fair country
"Honestly I just wanna know how you got that they're american. like I'm fully on you guy' side here, but their post history doesn't once mention their country of origin, unless I missed something"

"The funny thing is, even during the late 00s to early 10s when Madrid got battered left and right by Messi and co.

they were not whiny like this current Madrid

CR didn't won Ballon d'Or? He and other Madrid players will still be there

Bad refs? Just complain in the post-match interviews and move on"
Ball so hard
"He just commented on a subreddit from northern Virginia in the USA, about what he lived close to. Suffice to say our friend was right"
He called the Premier League the EPL

"I never understood why this is done only to soccer when the one of the most most successful footballing nations in Europe calls it calcio 

Especially given calling soccer is no different than calling it footy when looking at the etymology"
You'd think it'll be you guys if they're so keen on society
"Oh we’re fine, we're not the ones having a public meltdown and trying to scare referees before a game against Barcelona. Praying for you guys though 😘"
"Doing badly after a period of unparalleled success making them by far the most historically successful team in Europe has led to them thinking they’re entitled to success no matter what. Their stature has elevated even more since the late 00’s. They were getting regularly knocked out early in the Champions League and whilst they’d still won it historically the most times, it was “only” 9 compared to Milan’s 7- having not won since 02. Barca were on ~~5~~ 4 by the time Madrid won it again, having won it twice since Madrid last did, and had become the first La Liga team to win the treble. Even if they hadn’t won as many champions leagues other teams had different achievements that you could argue made them the best team.

Now Madrid are another level above everyone else, having won 6 more, and they seem to have got far far more entitled as a result."

I feel compelled to intervene here (my flair should explain why) but Germany is the most successful footballing nation in Europe.
We live in a sociedad
To be fair that’s ownership not the fans crying I’m disgusted by the clubs obsession with refereeing just play fucking football but thank you for your prayers we’ll need it 😂😂😂
But you are having a public meltdown because that little club you support got eliminated. Pray for a better squad 😂
"Slight correction.

Barca won the treble first time at 08/09 - at that time Madrid had 9 UCLs and the win was Barvas 3rd UCL overall.

Barca won their fifth UCL and a 2nd treble in 14/15, by that time La Decima had already occurred the previous season, when Barca would have 4."
Ahh yes the streaming is very complicating for my mind

"You’re right and I meant to put “one of the most”

Apologies"
22 men kick a ball for 90 minutes and in the end Germany wins and all that
"I think this depends a bit on how you interpret ‘most successful’. Germany has the most successful national team, winning one more European Championship than Italy, but Italian clubs have won 39 major european trophies compared to 29 for German clubs. I think you could make a case for Italy being the most successful across both club and international football."
Thank Vini lil bro
"This guy doesn't even know his own club lmao, real Madrid are owned by the fans and they elected this heinous old man who disgraces the great institution of real Madrid."
Their squad put 3 past us. Unlike yours.
"Oh yeah, I meant 4 by the time Madrid won it again, not 5. Thanks for correcting that!"
Sounds like it. 
All good. I don’t know why people take so much offence with soccer either. I use football but it feels unnecessary to take issue with soccer.
Historically that was pretty much it.

This goal will really Stay With Me
"Three consecutive promotions, unreal"
"Well that sums up today, truly awful.

We haven't been at it at all.

Congrats Wrexham."
They've actually gone and done the fucking thing. Insane.
"They are going up, they are going up!!"
What an incredible goal to practically seal it for promotion. What a striker
"3 goals, 3rd straight promotion. It's like poetry, it rhymes."
Congratulations Wrexham
Premier League team in 2026
"Wrexham with three golazos to win promotion, that’s how you do it"
Thought this was going to be less one-sided after Charlton thrased Wycombe. Turns out Wycombe was just bad.
What did I say?? I was down-voted for saying Wrexham FC is gonna make history today and even got my thread deleted
Gonna be mad in the town tonight
The Writing's on the Wall for the rest of the automatic promotion chasers.
Every FM player's dream IRL
career mode rtg type shit
"Good luck in the playoffs, you have a great chance."
Championship is a different kind of beast.
"Nah, they won't hack it in the Championship in the same way."
Who do you think will Latch onto the other automatic promotion spot?
"Cheers, although I'm prepared for the usual pain."
Jamie Vardy is gonna carry them to PL

why don’t teams sing on tv anymore
"Can we please remove this post for the incorrect headline?

I'm telling you 1990 was *NOT* 35 years ago

Jokes aside, massive congratulations to Palace. This is an awesome achievement whatever happens.

Palace Forest final let's go."
I have to imagine they would have won the final if they all approached the match with the enthusiasm John Salako put into this performance
That singing makes me glad all over
"Yeah I don’t get it either, that was like 10 years ago MAX"
"Sad to see.

Really similar situation to us 3 years ago, hope they don't end up at the bottom like us. Laurent Nicollin has no money but at least he loves his club unlike our crook in chief."
"Sad to see.

For anyone who doesn't follow French football or isn't tuned into French media in general, Montpellier's title win in 2011-12 season was Leicester before Leicester.

One of the most legendary title wins of a top 25 league in Europe in the 21st century. I'd argue Leicester was better but that's right under it."
Force à tous les supporters du MHSC. I hope your club will make it and won't be sent to the abyss of french football because of an incompetent president and greedy mfers who can't negotiate a serious TV deal
"I'll offer a dinner date to Nicollin to cheer him up /s

Courage aux fans de la Paillade. You don't deserve this fall from grace."
"sad too see, hope they come back soon !"
They need Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa back.
Yeah not surprising 
"I don't see us coming back soon.

Maybe we will play you guys at some point."
I found out Remi Gaillard is from Montpellier because an upload on his latest whatever back in 2012 had him waving the flag at a Montpellier home game and included a shot of Giroud in it too.
"Who do they NOT need at this point? Get Utaka, Laborde, Belhanda, Giroud, Bedimo and Boudebouz back as well!"
You gave me flashbacks to my high school when we'd watch his videos Inbetween classes.
They had the intelligence to bring back Delort on loan this winter (he plays for an algerian team) but it turned out to be useless and he scored 0 goals in 9 games

"Southampton trying their hardest to equal derby’s record, gotta respect the hustle 🤝"
Was dooming so hard this entire match wtf lol
The Sessegnon renaissance back at Fulham has been lovely. Always feel for players plagued by injury.
"Yess my Sess! (But sorry, Southampton. This probably stings)."
Sess and Cairney celebrating together ❤️
Ah not again
I love him so much
"He’s been so clutch for us, love him."
The technique for this header is absolutely ridiculous.
The prodigal son is back!!
That's some finish
One of our own 🥲
Hey I’ve seen this one before
Clutch FPL save
"I think Leicester is our only chance of beating Derby's point total now, although it would be very funny if we beat Arsenal on the last day."
The wait for 11 points or higher… continues (cue apprentice theme)
Oh absolutely fuck you Fulham
They've done it!
Quelle surprise
You love to see it
Think half of the points Derby got were from Fulham as well.
"I’m with you, my head was on fucking Mars"
"Ryan managed 2 league goals for Spurs in 2205 league mins. Since coming back to us, he’s got 4 league goals in just 438 league mins.

Back to his best"
"Nah we've been here before (many, many times). We're dead inside at this point."
Took me a while 🤣
2 of the 11. Fulham didn't beat them.
Newcastle actually iirc
I was losing my mind watching crosses get continuously whipped in to absolutely nobody
"I think he moved way too early, had some loans, was never getting consistent game time here. He’s only 24 which is insane so I hope he continues to do well. Good lad."
Is he playing LW?
I'm certain you'll get something against Leicester to avoid that record.
It doesn't even hurt anymore at this stage.
Rookie numbers
And 4 of the 11 from Newcastle (:
Thought we lost one and drew one. Oh well.
"My biggest gripe in so many Fulham games is this, aimless crossing to one man in the box who is not a miracle worker. I like that there were a lot more players in the box this time."
"It wasn’t really that, his hamstring kept on exploding when he was with us. I remember his last surgery was supposed to fix that problem once and for all but when it was done it was his last year with us so it would’ve been a huge gamble to extend his contact. Happy he’s doing well at Fulham though."
"Hard to get consistent gametime when you're usually unavailable. Wish him the best, he had crap luck with injuries during his Spurs tenure."
"Started this game at LB and moved to LW later on. Last few games he’s been at RW due to injuries.

He’s basically playing wherever needed but there’s no doubt he’s most effective at LW."
"Mixed feelings as a Swansea fan. Obviously seeing your rivals suffer is part of what makes football great  but I can't help but feel for all the decent Cardiff fans I know. 

Plus what this means for the future of football in Wales. Not healthy to have the capital city club slide into the third tier. Best thing for them will be if Tan fucks off and they can get some proper ownership in."
22 years since playing in League 1...still remeber that Andy Campbell goal against QPR to get them promoted.
So they will have gone from prem and four tiers above Wrexham to in a lower league than them
"Writing has been on the wall for years really, still horrible to finally have it confirmed but we don't deserve to be in the Championship currently. Tan out."
Shame. Would have been nice to see 3 Welsh clubs in the Championship.
Hahahaha hahahaha
Time to blame Nantes again I guess. The amount of money Vincent Tan will be demanding from them has just doubled.
"Into no man's land now. Cardiff should really be a premier league team, and now they're in huge financial trouble. Difficult to see a way back."
"No mixed feelings for me, glorious news. May they suffer in lower-league hell for many a year."
"Yeah, I'm a Wrexham fan so no particularly strong preference towards to Cardiff or Swansea, but from a Wales perspective it would have been great to potentially have 3 clubs in the championship"
Nice to hear from a Swansea fan. I’m Cymru first but Cardiff second. Spot on as well. Shame to see our clubs shuffling in different directions!
One of the worst days of my childhood that
"In the matter of 2 years, madness"
Looking pretty good for you lot right now.
"Well, no, it hasn't been just two years since Cardiff were in the Premier League; it was 2019 when they went down last."
it certainly is :)
Depends how you look at it. Being financially doped by hollywood celebrities and just buying success might feel hollow and soulless to some people
"Oh right, we were 3 tiers apart 2 years ago, not 4, my bad. Point still stands though"
"A Malaysian businessman or the co-founder of Capital One are much more soulful ownership structures, truly."

One of the most cowardly refereeing decisions I’ve seen
Keepers being overprotected is my biggest football hate
How does he not even get called to the monitor? What an absolute joke VAR is.
Is Palmer going to be okay? Is he expected to make full recovery?
"Absolute, stupid fucking bullshit. "
Absolute joke call. Prime example of overprotected GKs.
"He literally stands still, what is the foul?"
Absurd that's called considering how corners are open season on keepers lately
"Absolutely atrocious decision. Keeper went into Bruno, not the other way round"
"What foul? How does VAR say that's a foul? 

Bruno literally just stands there and makes no move towards the keeper who fannies about with the ball. 

What a joke."
"Palmer is a knob, Bruno literally stands still and he walks into him. Goalkeepers are too protected. Also how is that not overturned by VAR?"
I truly loathe how stupidly protected keepers are.
"That's some bullshit, Palmer extremely weak there. Should've been a goal."
Might be biased but that is possibly a goal being ruled out that should see people pulled from fixtures for a few weeks. There is no foul and the referee and VAR have shit the bed so badly. 
Haha what the fuck. Pathetic decision. These officials man.
Isn't it a clear and obvious no foul?
Keeper bumps into Bruno and it's a foul? lmao okay
What a ridiculous call. The keeper protection is laughable at times
"If this is getting ruled out, then Arsenal should be about 15 goals worse off this season... 

That's litterally exactly the situation they create on every corner..."
Reminder that half the people on here are convinced we never have decisions go against us
Bruno was just standing there! Menacingly!
I think this was a case of you touch the keeper you get a foul. Except the keeper touched him so *shrugs*
shocking call
Var spent 2 seconds on that what a joke
"VAR bottles another intervention. 

What’s the fucking point of it."
Such a bad fkn call…
"Yet dipshits still claim we get preferential treatment.

Arsenal have released club statements over less."
"Don’t thunk Bruno “literally stands still”, he’s obviously backing into the keeper, however I think Palmer is so exceptionally pathetic that I don’t think it’s a foul. Yes, Bruno backed into him, but I don’t see why he has to get out of the way"
"I dislike Newcastle likely more than the next average guy but this is a farce, goal should've stood."
If he doesn’t look at the goalkeeper and then turn his back into him then he gets that as a goal. Keeper was going to make that mistake regardless but he gave the ref a easy choice to make
"Only thing I can think of why VAR didn't call it back is if it came off Bruno's arm. In the other angle it looked like it might have, but I only saw it once. If it came off anything other than his arm it's one of the worst VAR misses I've seen."
"No attempt to play the ball, deliberate attempt to obstruct. Obstruction is a foul..."
I think it's a foul. He stops and leans his weight towards the keeper as he tries to catch it.
"Looks at the keeper and backs into him, in my opinion. Seems reasonable enough."
"This is exactly it, ref doesn't want to actually say what everyone sees. I'd love to know what an acceptable level of contact with the keeper is if that's not it"
"The referee was pretty poor throughout the whole game. There were several moments where a stern warning would’ve been enough, but instead he went straight to handing out yellow cards. Even as a Newcastle fan, I thought it was harsh when Ben Johnson got booked for simulation — and then, when he committed a genuine yellow card offense, the ref had no choice but to send him off. It all felt a bit over the top."
"Been boiling my blood since I was like 10

They get so much privilege to just do whatever the fuck they want in the box to everyone else’s hazard"
"Same shit happened to Leicester against Liverpool. Refs are just rewriting the rules that there can't be any contact with the keeper. PGMOL needs to stop this crap. Keepers need to be stronger and committed if they are going for a ball in the air. Everyone has a right to play it.

Edit: Man the hypocrisy of this sub wanting to all complain about this call because it happened against the rich club but I call out it's essentially the same shit that this sub was arguing should have been a foul last week. Can't have it both ways, but sure, brigade the downvotes lmao."
[Palmer to Bruno](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.kym-cdn.com%2Fentries%2Ficons%2Ffacebook%2F000%2F044%2F506%2Fstanding_there_menacingly.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=c96a0db23c088fba6b999fd942c849d533ddd74065a914f24c5c588de4504315)
And what makes it even more crazy is he could've easily caught it or even just punched it.
"Are you lot blind, he looks right at him then leans into the keeper."
"I'm not saying this about this particular situation but I wouldn't say goalkeepers are too protected. This season we saw too many goals from corners where there was a foul on the goalkeeper. If this continues to go on, goalkeepers may start Oliver Kahning these strikers that are too close to them. Also some teams just playing for corners and yeeting the ball in the 5 yard box from corners all game ruins football a bit."
Yeah I don’t understand how you can do whatever you want to a keeper on a corner but in every other situation you can’t touch them.
"Tbf after that soft af pen we just got, can you blame them"
"Exactly. Bruno has no obligation to vacate the space.

What are we gonna have next, 1 on 1s with the keeper, where the keeper shouts ""Keepers"" and the striker has to step aside and let them have it?"
Yes looking at and turning your back on players is notoriously a foul. 
If it’s for handball they take more than two looks at it
If you want to go that route every corner all season would be instantly called for a penalty or free kick though.
Have you watched any Arsenal matches over the last 2 seasons? They do this on literally every corner and it's never given as a foul. The refs shouldn't be giving it randomly here when they've ignored it for years.
"1. Direct free kick

A direct free kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offences:
- impedes an opponent with contact

https://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules/laws/football-11-11/law-12---fouls-and-misconduct"
"He _leans_? Oh, the humanity!"
I think what you’re trying to say is he stands his ground and doesn’t roll out the red carpet for the goalkeeper to come and gracefully collect the ball. It should be a goal.
Your team's corner technique is literally load the keeper. None of your goals from corners should have stood.
Palmer's embarrassing and not disallowing it wouldn't keep me up at night but the amount of people claiming he does literally nothing is baffling.
"Only an Everton flair would argue for that Leicester goal, that is not even a remotely controversial decision. Clown."
"Lmao the Liverpool one where with zero eyes for the ball he went into Alisson’s ribs whilst he was mid air?

I agree that keepers are overprotected but that’s not an example of it happening, those are given as fouls across the pitch."
What so disallowed for invading the keepers personal space? Give it a rest mate.
So the player isn't allowed to hold their position now? So all the goalkeepers had to do was just barge into the players standing and fall and get fouls?
"Yeah he's not even looking at the ball, he looks at Palmer then turns his back into him to interfere, then sells it by acting like Palmer pushed him."
"Yeah because he'd have given this goal if he was on our side, this just proves the refs are useless rather than corrupt"
"I’m not saying it is, I’m saying he made it an easy decision for the ref to make, which he did considering he blew his whistle instantly"
"Hmm, can't they quickly play on if it clearly comes off his arm? Just pointing out something I didn't see mentioned. I'm a Newcastle fan so very biased to hope/think it should have been a goal!"
When that happens at corners to keepers it always is a free kick.
Then not giving them against Arsenal is the issue. And I 100% agree they have benefitted from very favourable calls as part of their routines which have deliberate obstrctuion involved.
It can still be a foul. It might seem subtle but the only thing he's doing is trying to obstruct the keeper as he goes to catch it.
That hasn't been our corner tactics since last season. Now it's just overloading one of the posts.
"Explain why every pundit thought it was controversial then? Wtf lmao

I'm that case Leicester player at least played the ball. In this case he didn't, albeit he tried to get out of the way. Both were perfectly legal in their own rights

Edit: mfer wants to call people on their flairs but wants to hide his. While he is more biased than I. Gtfoh"
If he had zero eyes for the ball how did he pass it to his teammate then? And Allison wasn't mid air. You need to watch it back. Y'all just rewriting history.
"If standing in a spot and turning your back is impeding the keeper then sure, it's a foul."
Disallowed for deliberately impeding the keeper.
"He's clearly trying to impede the keeper, not just hold his ground. Keepers get more protection for things like this because it's ridiculously exploitable otherwise, unless you're happy to see 4 defenders surround the keeper and ""hold their position"" completely trapping them."
"He’s looking at the ball until he sees Palmer moving towards him, so holds his position."
"So why is that an easy decision if a player does something legal. It's not like when a player looks at another player and not the ball when committing a foul when going up for a header. He stood still, the only decision to make is to give the goal. "
"No it’s not. Arsenal’s entire corner system is doing exactly this. Guy in place making life hard for the keeper but not moving into him, just in the way. And it’s never an issue."
Let's hear your take on every set piece Arsenal has scored the past two years.
"The keeper doesn’t have a right to catch the ball, he can punch or palm it away"
Every pundit being Gary Neville?
Take the blue tinted specs off
"Regardless of Bruno’s stance, what was Palmer expecting to do, phase through him?"
"Where exactly was Palmer planning on going, phasing through Bruno?"
That's exactly what arsenal has been doing all season and goals where given
"""Holds his position"" except if you look at where he was when he started looking at Palmer and where he was when contact was made you can literally see he kept moving into him.

https://imgur.com/a/zBSj0eL"
"Because by looking at the keeper and actively turning into him regardless of whether it’s a lot of contact or not is going to make it an easy decision for the ref, especially with how protected keepers are. He should just stood there facing him and let the keeper flap his hands. He didn’t just ‘stand there’ he turned his back into him, not a lot but obviously enough for ref to make a decision quickly."
Every post game thing I watched they all hated the call. At least 5 different analysts said it was a terrible call
"Literally go watch any analyst talk about it and they said the same thing.

If y'all want to say that was a good call then fine. So was this. I operate on of it isn't a foul against an outfield player it's not a foul on the keeper, but clearly y'all want to apply rules differently in different situations.

Edit: yet another red who doesn't flair up and brigades comments pointing out their inconsistencies."
"GO CATCH OR PUNCH THE BALL. PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO STAND IN FRON OF YOU.

PLAY THE FUCKING GAME"
"Doesn't really matter, he deliberately impeded him with zero attempt to actually play the ball."
Rewatch the clip and look at your number 15
"Again you keep saying 'turning his back' as if turning your back is a foul or an offence. He can look at him, face him, turn his back or do the hokey cokey. Neither of those is a reason to disallow the goal. "
He literally gets shoved into the ribs and off the pitch when jumping to catch the ball.
"I can’t tell which side you’re arguing mate, do you think the decision was correct or no? Indoor voices please"
"Had intent to play the ball until was pushed by the 15 and keeper was coming towards them.  
    
By your definition him simply existing in that position was impeding Palmer"
If you think Bruno is being pushed hard enough there to clatter him into Palmer then you must think he weighs 10 kilos
"You giving the ref (in his mind) a reason as to why he fluffed the ball, it’s justification to blow the whistle in his eyes whether we agree about it or not"
Again. Rewriting facts. Allison still was on the ground as he half assed went for the ball. This clip the keeper is fully in the air and Newcastle not even playing it. By your logic this is even more egregious than your match.
"The decision was a farce. Bruno stood there and turned his back. Palmer decided he wasn't gonna make an attempt to play the ball and instead put on his swim trunks and went for a splash.

I remember Bernd Leno getting fucking held a few years back in a match against Brentford and the ref was like nah, not a foul. And then Arsenal started crowding the keeper at corners and people would complain it was a foul when the Arsenal player stood their ground."
Pushed by the Ipswich player 😂
"Body turned in the same way Burgess pushed on him, albeit lightly. Anyway, where was Palmer planning on going, morphing through Bruno to catch the ball?"
"Not if its not an offence. Turning your back to someone isn't a foul. The keeper has no more right to that space on the pitch than anyone else, particularly someone already occupying it. 

The ref can't call fouls that aren't fouls, then be like ""oh, well he looked at him funny"""
I’m on your side mate hahaha
"If you want to say that Bruno impeded the keeper, I think it’s fair to say he was pushed no? We’re pushing limits here aren’t we. He was definitely pushed to an extent, and has every right to exaggerate it. 15 pushed his left shoulder and his body twisted accordingly."
"Lol hilarious. I was pissed about this goal, and then the yellow for diving, and then the 2nd yellow was on obvious yellow but then a red because of the previous ineptitude.

I'm just so angry at PGMOL I'm yelling on reddit. I'd go touch grass but it's raining all day lol"
"No, because he wasn't pushed and Bruno deliberately impeded the keeper."

Lmfao that arm flail was hilarious
"Dont give up. Double down. Triple down.

Nike. Just do it."
"Unironically a tinpot club

And the mad thing is this is coming from official club media"
"*“Others, who don’t even have a television channel, criticize referees as well""*

Man, Real Madrid TV really is priceless."
Small club energy.
Off course they do.
It would be one thing if this was a fan production but the fact that it's an official channel for the club is insane.
"I genuinely don't understand - this is the biggest club in the world. Literally unreachable success in european competitions, THE #1 destination for the sports biggest stars


... so why did they develop such a tinpot village club mentality? "
Shameless club 
Only thing more embarrassing is their fans justifying it.
"I think the funny thing about RMTV is that barely anyone watches it.

The other funny thing is that while they trash  refs, etc, Florentino openly makes calls to help get Olmo inscribed by the league when he calls the minister for Sport because he needs a strong Barcelona for the Super League. So the official position of the club is convulted becasue you get RMTV openly bashing Barcelona and the league on refs, while the club itself never made a statement on it because it's not in Florentino's best interest.


With the whole shit show yesterday alot of local Madrid fans in youtube, twitter who have big followings are turning on Florentino because of this and many asking for his dismissal because either you go full on and not play the game because the refs went after you, or you shut up and play and not put out any statements, but not this half-hearted measure bs which just makes you look like an idiot and embarrases the club."
It's so crazy to scream corruption when Mbappe had his suspension reduced so he could play this match when any other team in any other league would have had a 5 game suspension for that criminal tackle
"No break on the fascist train, choo-choo"
"Feels like a self-fulfilling prophecy. As soon as they get a shit decision go against them, they're going to cry that they're being victimised for this stunt."
"As a Madrid fan, I’m tired of Florentino’s bs with this subject. Either stand firm and don’t show up to play, take this to the courts or don’t publish any of this non-sense and go play."
Little d energy
Real Madrid doubles down through its TV
Tensions are running high. Just saw a video of Barca supporters burning mbappe jersey and Madrid supporters burning Yamal jersey while singing puta Barca and puta Cataluña
The club should sell if they want to keep doing this. Liability dissociation.
How many of these posts do we need? Everyone agrees it's childish and petty to have this tv channel broadcast these compilations. So whats the point. They have the right to do that and seems like they will continue despite everyone agreeing they shouldnt. Thats it. Its not an interesting discussion.
"Only way to save Football. People always complaining about refs, but when the only club is there to fix it, they are against them."
"What does tinpot mean in this context?

Edit: Not an attack, just don’t know the definition"
Wonder how a tinpot club ended up becoming the most successful club in the history of the sport
Ironically I don't think so because a small club would have already gotten punished
It is their usual us Vs them mentality others don't have a channel at the end of the day a little pressure on referees can go a long way in getting 50/50 decision or a penalty and that is why they get favourable decision RMtv benefits real Madrid like it or not in spirit of the game it is bad but doing anything to win a advantage 
They are the Israel of football
It's not too dissimilar to the situation in the US.
"You are correct but you are missing the point.

Madrid have lots of other media on their payroll to distribute the message that no-one actually saw on Madrid TV. Things like mainstream newspapers, news channels, etc.

Also ClubTVs have this exact role. Doesn't matter if a single person saw it.

If a club president comes and says unhinged or even illegal things directly he will get punished and maybe the club as well. But the club TV is a different entity so it exists exactly to say what the president can't."
"Are those in the Spanish speaking world? Because I saw a tweet of an English speaking Real Madrid fan with around 100k YouTube subscribers who said “Real Madrid had every right to say what they said, there was not a single lie” and it had 7k likes. I would link but I think it would maybe break a subreddit rule here."
RMTV is on whatever Spains equivalent to freeview tv right? I think i remember watching a movie I couldn't understand on that channel on holidays once. You'd think with the traction some of their stuff gets here it would be as big as the BBC lol
">As soon as they get a ~~shit~~ decision go against them, they're going to cry that they're being victimised for this stunt.

Fixed that for you.  It's not just bad decisions, it's decisions they don't like. (Which to be fair isn't unique to Madrid, but most teams don't do it through their official channel)."
"Well, he is there to stay, he changed the rules and it's almost impossible for anyone to challenge the presidency.

I find hilarious that the club allows the tv to make the craziest takes but florenvito himself is helping Barcelona."
They have the right to embarrass themselves and we have the right to ridicule and criticise them for trying to coerce the officials
"Apparently as long as the club acts like this. You lot should start asking questions instead of mindlessly aping what the regime is telling you to say. Many already understand this, but too many are willing to just go along with it. If any other club - I repeat, ANY other club - acted like RM has been acting all season you would join in the chorus of boos with the rest of us."
"Disagree, it's very interesting to shit on Madrid"
just take the L lad
Someone will probably explain it better than me but tinpot means it looks like the real thing but isn't taken seriously and seen as a joke by others. You could say the Club World Cup is a tinpot competition for example or the old Confederations Cup.
Yet you still act like a tinpot club
Just makes all of this even more of an absolute embarrassment. Reeks of insecurities.
Wonder why you support them mate
"You're meant to be the biggest club in the world yet the club acts like a big diva that thinks the world is against them

Absolutely a tinpot club"
Dirty money is the safest bet
Okay chill maybe?
Mate we haven't done a fucking genocide yet
"Spanish following is almost entirely behind Perez and the club's actions, don't let reddit make you think otherwise."
"I don't care what the international fan thinks, I'm talking about people who go to the stadium to watch the games or at least live in Madrid"
"Exactly. Very hypocritical. Started a thread on our sub, hopefully people wake up."
coerce the officials? Lol these videos are doing literally the opposite.
What the fuck can I do? Write a letter to Perez?
"I didn’t think the Confederations Cup was all that bad…it was a mini tournament that wasn’t too taxing in length for the players, and a good test run for the World Cup venues for the following year."
Oh okay thank you
Nearly killed every Liverpool fan by scamming the UCL final
"Florentino has a cult of personality, especially amongst the older folk but for a lot of people yesterday is a very big deal. Pretty much the guy with the biggest following on local Madrid twitter and youtube who breaks a lot of news when it comes to Vini and other things he digs through openly called for Perez to step down."
Fair. I’ll trust your take since I can’t really verify it myself.
"It's one thing you can do. Make your voice heard on your socials. Band together with fellow fans that might feel the same way.

At the VERY least stop defending it or downplaying it."
"I don't disagree that it rubbed people the wrong way. I don't disagree that people who likely don't enjoy Perez at this point in time (for any reason, be it sporting, politically etc), have tried to use it to make their views stronger.

But it's also not true at all that it has somehow caused a massive uproar (or an uproar) to local fans, as they are firmly behind their club. Granted I don't live there, but I do have a family in Madrid who are members of the club. And in their mind the club is correct"
They are? Thats why the videos are such a braindead idea on top of the ethics. They arent creating fear they are creating animosity and resentment from the referees. Refs arent some babies who are afraid to make decisions
"Im not defending or downplaying anything. I have said its petty and childish. I dont think its anything more than that and I think thats realistic take, not overreacting or downplaying. 

Im just not gonna watch this circle jerk of haters just using this to release all pent up hate they have had for years. I see right through that."
"A lot of people were happy with not doing the dinner, not going  to the press conference and not playing the game unless the refs changed.

Madrid playing the game with no changes is what has caused the fan uproar on Perez especially when it was found out that he had a call with the sports minister.

They guy I was talking about is a big defender of Perez, but this he views as the club bowing down to the federation and Barcelona."
This is you downplaying it ⬆️
I think you are overplaying it. Its wrong but it doesnt warrant this many posts and comments.

Is this just a purple patch from Banik or can they actually challenge the Big 3 now?
Why are Sparta Praha so low?
They have direct UCL seats! Good for them
"Is this a league that fits the description of what Jose Mourinho said in 2018 or would that be unfair?  I remember seeing Plzen in the Champions League in the past.

""I could be in another country with the league in the pocket, the kind of league you win before it even starts."""
"Most likely nothing long-term, unfortunately.

Last time Slavia won the trophy (2020/2021), the big three also wasn't fully together, with Jablonec sneaking into the bronze position. It didn't result in them being able to challenge the big three any of the following seasons. I assume it's gonna be similar story with Baník, but I hope I'm wrong."
"They've been really good and I can see either of the three finishing 2nd and reaching UCL qualifiers, but in the long run Sparta and Plzeň will probably be better."
"Well, Sparta being kinda shit this year helped and they only played 4 qualifying matches in UECL, so that also probably helped."
Their coach Priske left to Feyenoord and they've made some bad transfers after that
"Nah, it's always a big question mark at the start of the season if the champion will be Slavia, Sparta or Plzeň. Just like Scotland has 2-teams league, Czechs have a 3-teams league."
2021 Slavia 2022 Plzeň 2023 Sparta 2024 Sparta 2025 Slavia
"Yeah, it'll be difficult for Baník to play European cups while challenging the big 3. Neither Jablonec nor Slovácko could do that few years ago. They'll probably be 4th next year, but several points behind 3rd."
Wait how did they made bad transfers tho 
"Ah ok thanks, that's interesting - big win for Slavia this season then."
Poor scouting I guess
Verwacht er niks van. Ik heb slechts èèn keer Sparta gelijk zien spelen in de Arena. Denk eigenlijk dat het een hele saaie wedstrijd gaat worden.
Goede keuze om Kitolano op te stellen ipv Eiting. Meer power en inzet op het middenveld heeft Sparta wel nodig deze wedstrijd. Eiting kan altijd nog invallen
"Steijn weer in de ArenA 😡

Hopelijk doet ie weer waar ie goed in is: verliezen."
dat was zo'n 23 schoten op doel maar 1-1 wedstrijd ofzo toch?
Ik denk dat het een 0-0 was. Dat was in de tijd van Suarez. Dat was een wonder dat Ajax die niet won.
"The valid criticism I see is the stupid neutral venue and the single-leg system and possibly the foreign players rule unlike the past tourneys. Doesn't make sense at all that East asian teams don't get to have home games against all those star players, might as well stick with East and West separated until the final"
"The east should just form up with oceania to make a new confederation, roughly same lenght between opposite sides just vertically and not horizontally. Most games can be played around the same timezone and club football will be more “fair”.There’s a lot more parity nowadays between the top east side teams, the top southeast Asian teams can hold their own against East Asian teams."
Should have left it as East West until the final
This will probably cause future issues
"So somewhat comparable to what happened in Europe, just some decades later."
Saudis also reduced the teams from 40 to 24
Al ahli won 3-0 while al nassr are winning 3-0 right now
"This isn’t that new though, Al Hilal are the best club side in Asia, they’ve won the Asian CL more than anyone else anyways"
"I don’t understanding how this benefits exclusively Saudi Arabia though. If it was Japan, Korea, China, UAE, Iran, or Qatar who spent the money instead, they would be dominating.

It should also be mentioned that half the goals scored yesterday where from local Saudis and not the foreigners. Aside from 6 clubs in the Saudi league, the rest have a very small transfer budget yet beat Al Ahli, Al ittihad, Al Hilal, and Al Nassr in the league and cup. A first division team even knocked out Al Ahli in the domestic cup.

A 7-0 loss is very humiliating in this stage. By your logic it should be a weekly occurrence to the smaller Saudi clubs when facing the top 4, and yet it’s not.

People tend to ignore the fact that the Saudi league has the best coefficient since 2021, before the whole money thing. Saudi clubs have won the tournament before and clubs like Al Hilal and Al Nassr have had many good performances in the past few editions.

Long story short, it is very logical that a country which spends hundreds of millions to billions to dominate the competition while their competitors use a fraction of that. No matter the venue or time."
"Arsenal won 7-1 vs psv in round of 16 
No fairness left in tournament 

Fifa NEEDS to split europe for fair competition"
"Sounds like someone who got destroyed 7:0 and is pissed about it.


He was even talking shit before the match too."
"Sounds like skill issue to me. In all the leagues and competitions in the world, there are rich teams and poor teams. And the rich teams always perform better. So I genuinely don't understand what they are complaining about."
"That is one hell of an away-day. Casual 11 hour flight from Gwangju to Jeddah, if such a flight was even available.  And then you get pumped 7-0. Oof. But yeah, where would you even play this for a neutral venue? It's a massive federations in terms of land area."
Also not a fan of Saudi Football but hasnt Al Hilal being consistently one of the best Asian side for a decade ?
UEFA CL still has Home and Away matches till the final of the tournament
Which country is favoured by UEFA?
"Similar, but no the same thing. Our change, good or bad, as been gradual, and everytime there's a new change, it has to please the big 5 federations. It's not like 1 can have more power than the rest and set the rules that they want. There's currently a big disparity in power and quality between the Premier League and the rest, but it's still not as big as Saudi Arabia and the rest of the AFC."
"I largely agree with your core point: the new ACLE format doesn’t *exclusively* benefit Saudi Arabia, as any nation with similar investment could theoretically gain similar advantages, and Saudi clubs aren’t guaranteed success, as shown by Al Ain and smaller Saudi clubs. The format rewards heavy spending and strong infrastructure, which Saudi Arabia currently exemplifies, but it’s not a rigged system ensuring their dominance. Your observation about local players and competitive upsets is spot-on—football remains unpredictable, and tactical execution can trump budgets.

However, I’d add a critical caveat: while not exclusive, the format is undeniably *skewed* toward Saudi Arabia’s strengths. The centralized finals in Jeddah, the removal of foreign player limits, and the focus on top leagues align with Saudi Arabia’s financial muscle and hosting capabilities. The AFC’s choice of Saudi Arabia for multiple years and the exclusion of smaller nations suggest a strategic tilt toward maximizing the competition’s commercial appeal, which Saudi Arabia’s star-studded teams enhance.

  
One thing to note that’s incorrect from your statement is that from the quarterfinals onward, matches are single-leg ties hosted in Saudi Arabia (Jeddah) for the 2024/25 and 2025/26 seasons, with provisional hosting rights for three more years. AFC suggest that creates a “tournament atmosphere” but eliminates home-and-away ties for the later stages.  If Saudi clubs consistently reach the final stages, the home advantage could compound over time."
"Lmao yeah, getting smacked 7-0 sucks, no doubt. But if you think it’s *just* about the scoreline and not the fact that one side had unlimited oil money, a stacked European all-star squad, and literal home-field advantage while pretending it’s “neutral,” you’re either trolling or willfully ignoring how rigged this whole setup is. 😂 Talking trash before the match is normal — but when the game’s already set up for one side to win, it’s not really trash talk, it’s just false hope."
"Yeah, bro, it’s kinda hard to “just get good” when one side is basically fielding a FIFA Ultimate Team squad with unlimited cash and no restrictions, while everyone else is stuck playing career mode on hard mode. 😂 When the tournament is hosted in Saudi, has Saudi refs, Saudi rules, and Saudi teams stacked with half of Europe’s starting XI... it's not really a competition anymore, it’s a scripted W."
"You don't, you have it as home and away. The AFC has gaslight everyone into thinking it is not feasible to do that in east vs west when that is simply not true, 20 years ago we had home and away between east and west. In National team matches, every international break in the last 50 years you have teams playing in the west on one day and 5 days later play away in the east, and it goes fine.

The AFC is fully controlled by the GCC, and they build up everything in their advantage. For the majority of the 2000s the East Asians had much better clubs than the west, so they split the tournament until the final, to guarantee a west asian team in the final. Now that the pendulum has swung, suddenly we don't need to split the west and east anymore, but wait we should still have it in Saudi Arabia, because ???? 

The Asian Champions League, by virtue of having the largest population and a 30+ football mad countries, should be a much much much bigger deal than it is, in reality it is a soulless competition that most people in the continent don't care about"
"yeah they are/were, but zoom out of al hilal and just the saudi league in general and its hard to see how anyone can compete anymore. Before the difference between the saudi league and the rest of the best asian leagues wasn’t that high, there was a degree of parity between them. That’s effectively already gone. It’s like a UCL team going against a league 1 team now. The saudi league (imo) hasn’t even reached it’s peak yet with the stars they are bringing in, and they’re already getting these results. 

I get that they spend more so they’re more successful, but i’d rather have a CL that has more parity and more exciting."
"So you do agree that the venues were chosen a year prior and during the same edition that Al Ain beat both Al Hilal and Al Nassr, showing that there is no guarantee for Saudi clubs to play at home? And if we’re being truthful, I highly doubt the venue would make such a large difference when as you say the Saudi clubs are playing the “European XI”.

For the foreigners I do agree with you, but I refer to my point about spending not being exclusive to Saudi Arabia and how much smaller Saudi clubs regularly compete with the giants. This entire Saudi favoring idea could easily be disproved if any other country started spending. It is may seem skewed towards Saudi Arabia currently and that’s because they’re willing to spend money and promote their league and by extension Asian football. Just look at how the UEFA Champions League handles its foreigner quota and it correlates to why they generate so much money and prestige.

At the end of the day, it is very obvious that the wealthiest will dominate and I’m not sure how this is unfair. I don’t see how Croatian teams are in the right to complain when they can face English or Spanish clubs."
"I think the only fair point here is the home advantage, which isn’t going to happen every year. But complaining that it’s not fair because Saudi clubs have better signings is wild. There’s nothing stopping the East to invest more in football."
"They dont have home advantage (the stadium is in a completely different city)
And they were the best team in asia even before the ""oil money"" so i dont see what your complaining about."
What you are saying is very true. They are just blatantly playing advantage for one side. 
Do you think there's gonna be an eventual split of the federation?
"Totally agree that the Jeddah finals were set a year prior (back in 2023), and Al Ain’s wins over Al-Hilal (5-4) and Al-Nassr in the 2023/24 edition prove Saudi clubs aren’t guaranteed to cruise just because it’s in their backyard. That’s a key point—upsets happen, and Al Ain showed tactical grit can beat the “European XI” Saudi teams, even in Jeddah. You’re also right to question how much the venue *really* matters when these Saudi squads are stacked with global stars. A Ronaldo or Benzema isn’t sweating the stadium—they’re used to hostile crowds and big stages.

That said, I’d argue the single-leg finals in Jeddah (set for 2024/25 and 2025/26, with three more years provisionally) still give Saudi clubs a *slight* edge. No travel fatigue, familiar climate, and a hyped-up local crowd can’t hurt, especially in knockout games where margins are tight. You mentioned climate change—Jeddah’s heat (often 30°C+) and humidity could hit teams from cooler climates (like Japan or South Korea) harder, even if they’re pros. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it’s a factor. The lack of home support for non-Saudi teams in these single-leg ties also stings—imagine Al Ain’s fans packing their stadium for a second leg. The “tournament atmosphere” is cool for vibes, but it quietly tilts toward the hosts if Saudi clubs keep reaching the quarters or semis (like three did in 2025). 

You’re spot-on that spending isn’t exclusive to Saudi Arabia. If Qatar, China, or even Thailand went full PIF-mode and dropped billions, they could build their own superteams and dominate too. Buriram fielding eight foreigners is a great example of others dipping into the no-limit rule. And yeah, smaller Saudi clubs like Al-Fayha upsetting giants like Al-Nassr domestically shows money doesn’t always win—tactics and heart still matter.

But here’s the rub: *nobody* else is spending like Saudi Arabia right now. The SPL’s $1B transfer window in 2023 is leagues above Japan, South Korea, or even UAE budgets. That gap lets Saudi clubs hoard talent, raise training standards, and pull global eyeballs, which compounds their edge in the ACLE. Your point about smaller Saudi clubs competing is valid, but in the ACLE, it’s the PIF-backed big dogs (Al-Hilal, Al-Nassr, etc.) consistently going deep. The format’s removal of foreign player limits and $12M prize pool screams “spend big, win big,” and Saudi Arabia’s the only one flexing that muscle. If another country steps up, they could flip the script, but until then, it’s Saudi’s playground.

This is where your Croatian teams vs. English/Spanish clubs analogy nails it. Wealthy clubs dominating isn’t new or inherently unfair—it’s just football. Man City and Real Madrid outspend Dinamo Zagreb, just like Al-Hilal outspends Buriram. The ACLE’s format, with no player limits and a glitzy centralized final, just amplifies that reality. I don’t think it’s unfair in a “rigged” sense—Saudi Arabia’s playing the game better, investing in stars, stadiums, and even hosting rights. Croatian teams don’t cry foul when they face Bayern; they just try to punch above their weight, like Al Ain did.

That said, the lack of home-and-away ties in the later stages does feel like a missed chance for fairness. Non-Saudi teams lose the boost of their own fans and home vibe, which could balance things out. Climate change adds another wrinkle—visiting teams dealing with Jeddah’s heat while Saudi players are acclimated could subtly favor the locals over time, especially if finals stay there for five years. It’s not a conspiracy, but it’s a structural nudge toward the big spenders.

I’m with you that the ACLE isn’t some Saudi masterplan—venues were set early, Al Ain proved upsets are real, and any country could theoretically spend their way to the top. The format’s not unfair just because the wealthiest dominate; that’s how elite football works, from Europe to Asia. But the Jeddah finals, no player limits, and fewer teams do tilt the scales toward Saudi Arabia’s current strengths—money, stars, and infrastructure. The climate and lack of home support for others add small but real hurdles. If another nation goes all-in, they could steal the crown, but right now, Saudi’s got the best cards. Fair? Maybe. Stacked in their favor? Definitely."
"Bro, come on. ""Different city"" doesn't change the fact that it’s still their country, their fans, their climate, their comfort zone. You think flying 10+ hours into the Middle East with no local support feels remotely neutral? 😂  
And yeah, Al Hilal has always been strong, but pretending the *current* gap isn’t supercharged by endless spending is just coping.  
There’s a big difference between being a top club and assembling a literal All-Star team because your league turned into Europe 2.0 overnight. People aren’t crying about losing — they’re pointing out that the competition isn’t even pretending to be fair anymore."
"Unlikely, but there better be some FFP/homegrown/foreigner rules or else no one outside of three or four Saudi clubs will give a shit about this competition. If push comes to shove though, a competition solely between East clubs could be a lot of fun. The A3 Champions Cup could make a comeback."
"I have a feeling that this reply is AI generated because it largely agrees with what I’m saying but also parroting previous points that contradict that.

The whole point is that we agree that it isn’t inherently unfair, it’s just the ones willing to develop and spend more will be the ones who dominate. Whether that’s Saudi Arabia, Japan, or Iran."
"Hi yes it’s a translated transcript because I’m non native English speaker so that was fine tunes from my native language and AI does carries some of my previous translation request forwards. With that said, basic sportsmanship should always be valued and considered. If the AFC wants to keep the tournament’s integrity, they should rethink long-term hosting and balance the format to give every underdog a real shot—because that’s what makes football worth watching. Speaking sincerely from a small nation in Asia."

Who’s on pens for palace next lol
Martinez celebrating like he saved that lol. Generational shithouse.
france v argentina again. mbappe is getting flashbacks
His penalty aura is just too much
"If Villa win this now..

Edit: well never mind then"
Emi Martinez and penalties...
Martinez just pumped all his stats into pens huh
Kamara should be off
Shocking pen
Got to score that fella. Now you've given Villa a right boost.
Awful penalty. Surprised that it was no second Yellow for kamara
Dibu mind control
"He hit the ball too hard, a little less force and it's in the corner"
Martinez cunt keeps getting away with it
Villa goal incoming in ~10 minutes
Feels like there's been a lot of terrible penalties recently.
Well that was shit
Something about Martinez where he goes from Boy Waterman to Buffon for penalties.
ramsdale celebrating in brunos face when he put it wide a few years ago was class
I do the same when the missies serves dinner but I’ve put the knives and forks out
"It makes sense he's happy the penalty was missed, even if he didn't personally save it"
I meany everybody does that
Cheers Geoff
Acting as if he saved it
It's a miss but it's definitely not shocking?
"It was actually really close to being a perfect pen, a few centimeters to the left and it was unsaveable"
They should file a complaint about a defective boost
After that howler vs Newcastle?
"“Alright dear we’ve made the dinner together, let’s do the dishes together :)”

Me after stirring the pan for a minute"
Imo any pen that dont even hit the target is shocking
He hit it wide from 12 yards of course it's shocking.

About time. Will be great to see them back at Underhill in a few years too!
Buzz buzz motherfuckers
The lack of Edgar Davids trying to fight everyone this time around will be disappointing.
They should’ve got promoted a while ago 
I dont know what to do with my hands
Could be centurions next week.
"Dean Brennan is destined for big things. Welcome back, lads."
I miss going to Underhill. Went to plenty of Arsenal vs Barnet preseason games there.
Oooh! Are they moving back?!
No Big John Akinde either 😩
"There’s a big campaign underway at the moment. I think they’ve just received planning permission from Barnet council, just a matter of time before it’s finalised"
"That's great! Hope they can get ""the slope"" back!"
Underhill is now a school. So unlikely to go back there unfortunately

13 goals left for the Bundesliga goal record
"Ngl Konny doesn’t get enough appreciation! Bro has been absolutely solid throughout the whole season!
And Olise is our best signing probably in last 5 szn"
Wtf is that Robben?
So Olise is the best signing from last summer?
Le cut inside man
Le cut inside man redux
Trademark Olise.
Let my boy cook
Crazy to suggest he’s been pots for Bayern this year?
Kane winning his first title. Maybe matrix will collapse before it happens
We are gonna finish 10th arent we?
Welp there goes any chances of Mainz getting back into the game
"I love him, man. He never stops running."
"Any hardcore Bayern fan will and should appreciate Konrad Laimer. This man has never let us down when he was called to action. He is not a UCL quality right back, but he can put a very solid shift there and his chemistry with Olise is still unmatched."
"Kane?

Edit: i meant as best signing of the past 5 seasons guys"
In contention for sure
Crazy not to
Konny is Konrad Laimer
"We paid fair market value for Kane, Olise's transfer feels like a highway robbery with how good and young he is"
"Konrad Laimer, I assume."
Kane's transfer doesn't come close to Olise's trasnfer
"He’s up there, but simply because of his price tag and the fact he hasn’t ""overperformed“ his transfer fee, he doesn’t feel quite as ""shrewd“ as Olise or Laimer.

After having had Lewandowski for so long, I couldn’t tell you another striker than Kane, I’d rather have in my team.

He also wasn’t or isn’t helped by the fact, that we don’t really have anyone to rest him, apart from a five years older Müller…
So I cut him some slack.

But even when he doesn’t score or directly assist, like today, Harry‘s passing is superb and he had a pre-assist today as well, for the above goal."
"Considering the drop off from last season too, Kane's definitely not a better transfer than Olise"
"If performance is the criteria, then Olise is the best signing from last summer. He has achieved significantly much more than was expected of him. I don't you can say the same about Mbappe."
"Been incredible every time I’ve watched him for Bayern, bargain for how much you lot got him for"

Can’t wait to never see Faes play for us again - why’s he just leaving acres open in the box
"Faes is probably the only CB in the league worse than ours (Saints fan) 

How he is a professional football player is beyond me, he's so bad."
How does Faes get selected for the belgian nt? He’s garbage
"Nobody even bothering to get tight to him lmao

We are a sheer disgrace of a team"
"Shocking that last time we played, we were 5 points behind, now 23 above"
"can't wait to see this guy play for my team, he just looks like the best player on the pitch almost every time i watch a Wolves game"
United star
He better not expect nice link up play and cut back if he joins united 😤
"I don’t watch a lot of Leicester games but whenever I do, he genuinely always stands out as the worst PL footballer I’ve ever seen play."
Just can’t even fathom what he is thinking here
this whole leicester team doesn't seem real
i mean he just doesnt give a shit and is not good enough for the PL. But he was great in the champ last year no?
Sounds like the striker who played for u guys under souness
I guess you didn't watch the game then... he was fine but no where near the best player on the pitch
"Are you still moaning about that u/Orcnick? Don't delete your post again this time

lol, blocked"
"I was defending him at the start of the season but I’m fed up of the bloke. His agency put out a video saying he put in a masterclass in anticipation when Everton whacked us for 4 and we conceded within 10 seconds.

Can’t stand his ego and the idea he’s never to blame. Last season it was funny seeing him waltz down the middle to smack a shot but that genuinely his level - how the fuck he starts for Belgium I’ll never know."
You could say the same thing about 90% of our squad this season
"Bold of you to assume he’s got a brain kicking about. Never seen such a bombscare.

I thought Soyuncu was mental but this fucker makes him look like Einstein"
Ali Dia? I imagine he is a better CB than Faes to be fair :D
"He had very good movement and pressing, good passes."
Does half ur squad even start in the championship
"I would say he did fine yeah, not very good imo but he had a good 10ish minutes

Idk maybe it looked better on the tv, but from the stands we were more impressed with andre today"
if they do it’s because we won’t be able to get rid of them and sign new players in their place
What do you mean? A lot of our squad is the same as last season when we won the Championship.
"People seriously do not watch him play, only in clips. I guess this is by design because 80% of the time he is walking or standing, 10% fake looking busy, and the other 10% putting his head down and do some world class shit. Undoubtedly amazing talent, but no one outside of Wolves pays attention to how he goes about getting it. 

There was not an easier player to pass around on the pitch today. It’s a testament to how good Andre is that people on the outside don’t really notice it, cuz he’s making recoveries and stops from disadvantageous positions (because of Cunha in front of him)"
"Honestly yeah, the triangle of agba, joao and andre is incredible at covering for the rest of the team. Another one is RAN who can get away with not tracking back because of them"
"Truly incredible and they are deserving of the most praise. Defensively, Munetsi deserves his flowers. Adding two cogs like that has made a huge difference. 

Pressuring teams from the front effectively combined with the excellent cover at the back with two world class ball winners in between them will choke almost any team. Minus Cunha, everyone grafts for the team (even RAN) which adds up to a nightmare to play against. 

It’s so frustrating to watch him come in and fuck up that whole structure, so he can conserve all his energy for the selfish reasons. In his defense, amazing player with the ball at his feet, gives you a ton, but takes away a ton."

Exciting play-offs upcoming.
"First year I've really followed it but it's been thoroughly enjoyable. Both Farnborough and Bath have had a decent showing, some good nights up at Twerton Park. Hopefully they can push for play offs next year but I doubt it

Almost makes Twerton worth going to"
"Obviously, Maidstone will now be promoted"
"And it was frantic too. Truro went 3-0 up in 10 minutes, basically all over right? 4-1 at half time while Torquay were 2-0 up. You'd say it was pretty safe as there needed to be a 4 goal swing.

Then Torquay make it 3-0 but quickly concede to 3-1 before restoring their 3 goal at 4-1. Truro then concede, making it 4-2 and Truro were looking a little shaky.

Torquay's opponents, Hemel Hempstead, then get a man sent off. Torquay now need 2 goals against 10 men, with 6 minutes of regulation plus the additional 8 of extra time to play. 

Thankfully local hero Rocky Neal restored Truro's 3 goal lead with 7 minutes to play, meaning Torquay needed to score 3 in just stoppage time to claw any hope back.

Fair play to Torquay, they gave it a great go. I thought at 3-0 in 10 minutes that the title was in the bag but was nervous up to the final whistle."
Maidstone for the win.
Funny way to spell Eastbourne!
"I only picked Maidstone and they are the only one outside ""the clump"". I'd actually like Torquay to go up."

If only he was healthy during the whole leg against United...
Deserves ‘great goal’ tag
"Little prince, what a goal !"
Shocked that Paris allowed the goal to stand
Lets have VAR fuck us again ?
"Honestly thought the ball went out, great goal though"
Splendid shot. All the goals tonight were absolute bangers

Love seeing celebrations for good defensive work/saves
First one was crazy
"All saves were good but the 1st one, ouf."
We Poles sure do have good goalkeeping genes...
"I love it when goalies get mad at their teammates like ""how dare you make me do any work"""
12 saves. Record for a OGC Nice GK on record in a Ligue 1 game (since 2006/07)
God damn you Sarri for making him leave the club...
"We sure do see a lot of amazing goalie performances against us lol. 

He took down our undefeated run alone imho this game. Spécial mention to Sanson who didn’t score since a year in L1 but puts 2 in our net with one scissors in the lot 😒

Our coach didn’t want to risk it in the last 20 minutes too which is both annoying and understandable before Arsenal."
Think Chelsea needs a new GK….oh wait!
Szczesny and Lewy use your connections to bring him over to sunny Catalunya
Shades of PSG/Ajaccio with THAT insane Ochoa performance for Cavani's first Ligue 1 game
Chelsea legend
"Incredible.  

To all MU honchos, need another Fabiański or Szczęsny? You can't go wrong with Polish goalkeepers. There's Bułka and Grabara (who imo is even better). Both are reliable, young and relatively cheap. Just go for it what's the problem?"
Basically just scored a hat trick
Bro took PSG’s invincible run personally 😭
Nice saves.
"Sheeeshh, insane reflexes on that first one"
My FM legend. I used to get him on a free from PSG and he served like 15 years for me!
10/10 Sofascore.
"great clip, thanks for sharing.  love some goalie love"
"What's his release clause.


It's a joke. But mark my words it will be headline in few days."
He is fantastic.
What a nice save.
"Good God keeps blessing us with world class goalkeepers, while we lack defenders, wingers, strikers... We appreciate the generosity, we just would like to slightly change its direction"
"Nice 2024-2025 season: shittiest European run possible, but they're having an overall good run in the league."
"WOAW! Those were all goals for sure, nice work bun"
Thats my (second) team!
He is such a great bread. 3 great saves. Poland really knows how to bread goalkeepers .
"Apart from the fabulous saves, love how he command the backline and demanded focus from his defence. A true great keeper knows he can only do that much and his backline need to squeeze out space to deny opponents shooting chance. Impressed that Bulka recognize this at a relatively young age."
Does he smoke?
I think it changed from celebration to frustration with how lost the defenders were
Good defensive stops are not celebrated enough
bro smacked that shit out of there
What about the last one?! Absolutely world class save.
Some cat reflexes on the first one for sure.
"I feel like Czechia, Poland, Switzerland are always overstacked on GKs, while we (AUT) didn't even have ONE GK playing regularly in a Top-5-League in the last 20 years!"
Shame we lack so much in quality with other positions. What is the point of having elite GKs when rest of NT is trash. We have Lewandowski and Zieliński but that's it.
He also looks like a unit. I don't know how he is flying like that with that much height
Some of the best saves I've ever seen were from Bartosz Bialkowski during his Ipswich days.
except Kacper Tobiasz
"Yeah... Got one stopping the unstoppable PSG in France, and another smoking cigarettes between breaks in Barcelona."
Barca should look into signing this keeper too.
I am happy to see him performing well.
Yeah it's not really about poor finishing but today it really was Bulka saving every shot on target. Well played to him and to Nice.
Sanson did it for all the time he got battered when in Marseille.
They gotta bring in my glorious king Zalewski
Kiwior as well
United had Kuszczak previously so not like they haven't got experience with a Polish GK
The problem is they are cheap. United loves to overpay.
Grabara is incredible. Won't be suprised if he moves on to bigger things than Wolfsburg in the summer.
Well if the first 1 went in there wouldn't be 2 corners afterwards
The reaction to the third one lol
You gotta be a good goalie when the likes of Dawidowicz or Salamon are your defenders
"The closest y'all got was Robert Almer, wasn't it?"
What about Manninger?
How do you feel about Pentz besides his height?
"I'll stand by opinion that Polish NT have 2 issue;

1. Team have no spirit, individual quality of players is there (like u said; Lewy, Zielu) but there's no tactic or teamplay, look at Danish NT, similar quality but as a team they are much better. 

2. In Polish academy they hate when players have any flair, they push players to play 'tiki-taka' and we don't have that in us, we have many players who have crazy flair, we have crazy street footballers but at pro level our players struggle with simple trick, because of that our wingers are always underperforming and we play like it's early 2000.

  
There's a reason why our best players in 20 years didn't spend much time in Polish league."
"No idea, but we can't just disband it, can we? At least some of us got to see a team with international class CBs, RB and wingers."
"Kiwior is starter for Arsenal, ""just"" 2nd team in EPL and UCL semifinalists. Cash is starter fo Villa, ""only"" UCL QF. Zalewski is bench player with some significant minutes in Inter, another UCL SF. Moder is significant contributor in Feyenoord retaining their top 3 spot with 5GA in last 5 games. Piątek is 2nd best striker in Süper Lig.

And even other players generally plays for good teams in good leagues.

Quality is there, on paper Polands NT quality-wise doesn't really differ that much from e.g. its 2016 version. A little bit worse when it comes to top-players, but actually deeper.

Now, how it works and is put together is tottally a different thing."
Does he smoke tho
There were rumours that he was being looked into. I'm sure he's on the radar.
"Raphinia is already talking about Saudis, maybe he goes after the season to score a bag, and Barcelona goes with Zalewski/Lewandowski/Yamal trio. They need a RB as well, Matty Cash enters the chat.

Give it a year or two, and Barcelona will be Polish just like Wolverhampton was Portuguese. 

And after Flick, Papszun takes over, or better yet, Adrian Siemieniec."
Kuszczak Colombia legend
"To play in a top 5 league? No. To have a great GK? Yes. He had a long run without conceding in that crazy qualifying campaign for euro 2016 where we had 9W, 1D, 0L, just to lose in a very easy group at the big tournament."
"I mean that was in the mid to late 2000s, so 20 years ago"
He did smoke a Lambo while drunk...
Who knew Barca's sauce was polish GKs all along
"Kolego, jest po 10, pobudka"
Jeszcze tylko turbogrosik 🙏🙏
"Ale ja nie śpię.
I, tak, wiem, że się zesrałem."
"I Krycha, żeby to pokazać Mbappe miejsce w szeregu na gran derbi"

"12 goals left for the Bundesliga goal record

Olise 9 goals, 12 assists this Bundesliga season."
RESIGN HIM RIGHT NOW
I swear if Kimmich takes another corner....
"Spurs fan.

Absolutely love him. 

He's such a good dude and cares so much."
"If you don't, I hope he returns to Sporting to end his career. I know he can easily make more money elsewhere, but one can hope."
So glad to see him doing good. Hes a great guy.
"you mean ""no Kimmich corner"""
Der Womanizer
Where did you get those values? I believe Olise has 8 goals and 12 assists in the Bundesliga.
"It’s painful as an England fan watching how good Kane, Olise and Musiala are for you and knowing if Southgate had been more proactive that should’ve been the bulk of England’s attack"
And is a buddy of Harry
Transfermarkt. But yea Bundesliga.de has him at 9 goals 12 assists.
Transfermarkt counts penalties won as assists
also deflected passes afaik.

I feel for all the Dagenham fans who got dogs abuse for the past week over this
Her insta post is controversial. She was director of engagement... She was like their social media manager and influencer not sports director.
This thread's going to get locked
"Good riddance, the board are shameless"
Hopefully they get relegated.
!flair :FC_Barcelona:
So they sack someone who supported Hamas...get bullied into apologising for it.
Yes we should all just remain silent in the face of atrocities. Surely that won't have any long term consequences.
"I searched her she support Palestine not ha*as, and the club support Israel, so that's really a stupid discussion from the club they didn't even searched her background 😂"
who supports not killing babies\*
"She doesn't even condemn Hamas killing innocent people (Palestinians or those on Oct 7th), she says it herself. 

She doesn't see attacking innocent people as terrorism unless it's her favoured side doing it.

https://www.hamas-massacre.net/"
"You can condemn Hamas and Israel, don't have to pick either of those to support.

Despite both sides committing atrocities.

Quick reminder of what she doesn't condemn: https://www.hamas-massacre.net/"
"Yes🫡, I know I need to improve my English more"
"Oh shut up, when will you condemn the IDF and what they’ve been doing to innocent civilians for decades?

And killing innocent babies? Women? Paramedics? Journalists? You know what we see on video everyday? Seriously what is wrong with your humanity that you choose to still turn a blind eye after all the evidence? 

But no Israel cried wolf so we must believe them, it’s also interesting we are yet to see those babies Hamass massacred they claimed. but a google search will show you many killed Palestinian babies, Israel are the true barbarians, not Hamass"
"Israeli government are scum, Netanyahu is scum, the IDF are scrum, Hamas are scum. 

People saying they support Palestinians don't have to highlight their messages with ""but just to clarify I don't support Hamas"". The same way people condemning Israel shouldn't have to clarify that they aren't antisemitic. Anyone with a fucking brain could tell you they don't support the innocent killing of people on either side.

At the end of this war the stories will say ""Hamas, a terrorist group killed nearly 1,200 innocent Israelis in an horrible attack, so Israel killed more than 50 times that number of innocent Palestinians in retaliation. (So far)"
"When you have a Palestinian flag it doesn't mean you support hamas. You support Palestinian people and their right to live in their homes. It's ridiculous to be annoyed about a flag that was created 90 years ago.

Fucking idiotic."
"You haven't condemned everything you disagree with in the world either, have you?"
Holy shit they are both bad. Support for either makes you a very weird individual.
"I condemn both?

Fuck Netanyahu's government and Hamas.

Oh, look what your Hamas friends do.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/01/middleeast/uday-rabie-palestinian-tortured-hamas-intl-latam/index.html

For decades you say;
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/27/hamas-executed-palestinians-under-cover-gaza-conflict-amnesty"
"> ""but just to clarify I don't support Hamas"". 

She made a point to clarify she doesn't condemn Hamas actions  (these actions https://www.hamas-massacre.net/)"
Almost like she chose the subject matter of her post and said specifically she doesn't condemn Hamas for https://www.hamas-massacre.net/
"I won’t condemn the marginalised, oppressed group. I will not condemn the intentions of Palestinians to break free from their chains, it’s their right to fight back from all the violence they’ve had to endure their whole life.

You are stuck in your privileged mindset if you do not understand this. Did you expect the oppressors to fight back by handing out handshakes to their enemy????"
And you haven't condemned the other sides atrocities.
"So you support Hamas?

Those that murder innocent Palestinians, haven't had an election since 2006?

One day you'll realise it's not just Israel that are appalling to Palestinians, it's Hamas too. Seriously, just look into the atrocities on their OWN people and not ONLY what Israel has done."
I blame the unchecked spread of the oppressor/oppressed paradigm in the past 30 years for this kind of left-wing brain rot. Hilarious you don’t see the end point of where this way of thinking will lead.
"Bullshit, I have condemned Israel.

A good 20 minutes before your post saying I haven't, as well.

edit: Try reading the article."
I literally have.
"> So you support Hamas?

Netanyahu does"
"Re read what I said and maybe you’ll get your answer.

Stuck in your simple minded ways, this question is irrelevant and just a deflection to the reality of the genocide actually going on.

They push Hamass as being the problem, but where was the evidence of those babies they beheaded?? You can find many Palestinians killed in bombs sent by Israel, with their body parts everywhere. How did you feel watching those videos?? Or did you turn a blind eye to that?

The women they raped?? What happened to that evidence?? But hey many accounts you’ll find of the treatment and humiliation of Palestinian women being sexually assaulted by IDF officers.

A deflection. Hamass and Israel are a false equivalence."
Would you not support the French resistance?
"Probably, they both hate the Palestinian people and can use each other to oppress them."
"No, no, he's their top recruiter."

I think he’s one goal away from reaching Raúl’s first season tally
Wonderful ball through
"That’s 6 in the last 6 for him, best Norwegian striker in the Prem btw"
Clearly should start for Norway can't think of a reason why he shouldn't
"I know Leicester are not really playing for anything at this point but bruh, why so much space all the time? "
What a pass
"Larsen been a quality signing so far, also what a ball"
That madlad on r/fantasypl that had Cunha and Strand Larsen in his team knows something
Great pass by Cunha.
I’m a fan. This kid has something
"Ga je mee naar het Strand, Larsen?"
Can see him having a big season next year
Cunha x Hojlund linkup is gonna hit harder than crack cocaine
"he is a great striker but the wrong one for united. he is too similar to zirkzee, they should replace holjund(who is gonna flop), and not the dutch. They shoud go for gyokeres isntead and play him with zirkzee"
They both have 13 I believe
"JSL is just different level man, fucking hell what a player"
"Yeah, who was that? We should sign him"
"The two other strikers are also insane lol. Then there's Bobb and Nusa on the wings, two of the most promising young wingers.... Hard to fit in lol"
We'll just have to invent the 3-1-6 formation to make it happen
Wout Faes is constantly rolling nat 1 on a d20 for Decisions and Coady doesn't know how to do anything other than drop deeper than the rest of the line to keep everyone onside
*Loan with option to buy
He knows that Leicester are rubbish
I have both ☝️🤓 and RAN
"Triple Wolves to the moon! Owning Ait Nouri, Cunha and Strand Larsen is picking up some points this week"
I did that. Also captained JSL
"Geen Jorgen gozer, hij zou dat heel graag willen"
Except George Beach Larsen is twice the player of course
Hojlund would be wrestling with the CB in the channel here 
The only thing that’s gonna hit harder is seeing Hojlund in a Getafe shirt when he’s sent out on loan.
hojlund absolutely will not be our starting striker next season
Good thing he’s playing left 10 if he gets signed
"United’s rumored striker signing is Delap atm, from the news Cunha isn’t being signed as a striker but as an attacking midfielder"
At no point was he even an option for United. Doubt Cunha will be either if you they don't win the Europa league
"I almost forgot Coady was playing, and yes, backtracking while letting forwards run at him with the ball was a specialty of his"
A true visionary indeed.

Brandt is an enigma. What a goal man
Where did this Daniel Svensson guy come from all of a sudden? He seems involved in everything the last few games.
What a finish
[Great Goal]
"Great fucking goal, Jule"
Jules Van Persie!  Nice to see him repay all of the faith that Kovac has put in him
vintage Brandt
Dann halten Sie hoffentlich jetzt Mal alle den Rand und reden nich schlecht über Brandt.
He's basically the entire team's essence distilled into one player
one of my favorite players in your team. but I imagine being BVB fan he makes you want to rip your hair out sometimes
"Winter transfer from the Danish league. He's been solid since they got him. And it's a loan with an obligation to buy that's around 6 million. 

What's crazy is I don't think any medium or big club were rumored for him and then all the sudden he signs with Dortmund and is starting every game. He also only has 1 cap for Sweden. He is looking like an absolute steal right now"
Denmark's first division
Loan with option to buy cheap
"Würde er Tore schießen am laufenden Band, dann wären Negativschlagzeilen verbannt."
"it's really not that complicated. He's a player who showed world class potential when he was younger and ""only"" became a good to great player when he's in form.

Sadly he hasn't been in form for a while now and the only reason he still plays this much is because we don't have a viable alternative (Reyna has his own problems).

Would be really clutch of him to finally find his form again in these incredibly important last few games, though"
Leizpig were in talks with him then we swooped in. Thank fuck for that
"He was having a great season in Denmark, so everyone knew he was leaving for a bigger league, but nobody expected him to go to a club of Dortmund's size and much less to do this well immediately."
Du hast es schnell erkannt ich glaub wir kommen aus demselben Land.
He never looked out of depth from the first minute of play. Very natural and comfortable playing wide left or defensive mid. We are so lucky to have landed a deal for him.

This shit is so embarrassing
"Official club media slandering a referee - totally fine

Referee being honest and vulnerable in front of the media - unacceptable, threatening the prestige of RFEF & CTA

Sure."
"I'm sorry, 

You bullied a ref, ref called you out, you cry bully?"
I've said it before; you could literally diagnose this club with Narcissistic Personality Disorder.
"Please god, let them not play the game. That would be so funny"
Honestly I’m really worried now for tomorrows game.
Biggest fallout between a club and their player ever
"This is the biggest and greatest club in the history of this sport, absolutely hilarious"
"Rm attacking refs: 😡😡😡
Rm when refs saying something back: 😯😯😯"
5:0 minimum pls Barca
Stop bullying the refs then dickheads
"Yes, yes. Keep this up. 3-0 forfeit and one less game to worry about."
Doubling down.  Pathetic
What a sad bunch.
Real Madrid are looking refs with anger in their eyes
"Real Madrid are truly an insufferable club. Has there been a club as successful as them cry and complain as much as this?

They need to get punished. We all understand referees have made mistakes but they are putting out hit pieces that in the hands of deranged fans, start doing the most ridiculous shit. 

We saw Rassie from South Africa (also a twat) in Rugby go after referees to the point they and families started getting death threats. 

Actually pathetic"
"I just hope Barcelona destroys them, they don't deserve more after all this shit.

  
I want Lamine to troll them."
"Respectfully, Fuck off"
Real Madrid fans can suck my Belgian dick
Freedom of expression for RMTV but apparently not for the referees lmao
Smallest club in the world
-10 points for Everton
I consider inadmissible the public demonstrations made by RMTV
"As a Madrid fan, this is inexcusably embarrassing. Instead of whining that refs steal the games, the directives should light a fire under the players ass so they can play well and / or hold them accountable for not playing well instead of appeasing them and victimizing the team."
"I pray to GOD that the final is a complete and utter robbery, I want at least 3-4 undeserving reds for Real Madrid and like 10 pens for barca."
"RM: ""that ref is corrupt and takes bribes""


The ref: "" it hurt my feelings that RM made such terrible accusations about me""


RM: ""we can't believe that ref made such biased comments. He needs to be replaced"""
Funny how this ref bs has been blown out of proportion by Madrid. Almost like we’re all supposed to forget that Mbappe probably should be suspended for this game after trying to break Blanco’s leg.
Throw the whole club away
Funniest part of this is they think the ref is gonna make a difference when they get slapped 5-0 again
"Real Madrid CF considers the public statements made today by the referees designated for the Copa del Rey Final, scheduled to be held tomorrow, April 26, 2025, to be unacceptable.

These protests, which have surprisingly focused attention on videos from a media outlet protected by freedom of expression, such as Real Madrid TV, deliberately carried out 24 hours earlier against one of the final's participants, demonstrate, once again, the clear and manifest animosity and hostility of these referees toward Real Madrid.

Even more surprising statements, in a threatening tone, alluding to the referees' unity, were used to announce alleged measures or actions that fall far short of the principles of fairness, objectivity, and impartiality that should prevail just hours before a football event that captures the attention of hundreds of millions of people around the world.

Given the seriousness of what happened, Real Madrid hopes that those responsible for the RFEF and the refereeing body will act accordingly, adopting the necessary measures to defend the prestige of the institutions they represent"
An utter abortion of a club. Spoilt brats who've been pandered to for far too long. Wankers.
I can't think of another team who whines and moans as much as Real Madrid. It's pretty embarrassing
"The RFEF should take serious action against us. This is beyond humiliating. I'm truly ashamed of the direction the management of the club I’ve supported for over 20 years is taking. The whole Ballon d'Or fiasco, the unchecked behavior of some players with no consequences, and whatever the mess is with Real Madrid TV—it's all a disgrace. The club is severely lacking in professionalism."
I STAND WITH MY CLUB (what the fuck are we doing????)
"Spanish League is honestly such a joke, no matter if it is Barca or Real. No matter how bad those refs may be, this is just cyberbulling prior to the match and some stupid bosses (we all know who is steering this) there will always question the integrity of the competition if they can't accept potential defeat. 

And that it is Real Madrid out of all clubs complaining about refereeing is like the weirdest part at all. Imagine all their CL opponents would use their scumbag behaviour every tume Madrid gets a questionable call...."
Madrid makes it so easy to hate them
What a bitch ass club
Where’s your famous Super League? Literally the most appalling institution in global football. Miserable entitled club who wouldn’t know empathy if it shot them in the face.
What a bunch of crybabies. Pathetic.

LaLiga is a joke for letting madrid successfully get away with all their whining and complaining repeatedly.
Absolutely pathetic. And people wonder why there's a shortage of refs. Anyone associated with that club is an embarrassment.

How are you one of the most successful clubs in the world and STILL find shit to complain about?
"If they don't want to play the final, they can sit and cry under Bernabeu's closed roof for all I care.

For all the talk about freedom of speech coming from RMTV, they definitely need to be taught a lesson on responsibility of speech."
"I find Real Madrid’s last 10 Champion’s League titles to be unacceptable, so they don’t count anymore"
"Seems Real Madrid is doing most of their playing off the field this season. Thats what happens when you stink on the pitch, you overcompensate outside."
"Spanish football is such a clown show, it's the reality TV of football."
They have won 15 Champions League titles and they still have the audacity to complain over the most trivial things. Pathetic.
Is Real Madrid becoming Donald trump?
Victim mentality
God I hope we smash them tomorrow with a crazy scoreline
Real Madrid. Truly the Eric Cartman of the footballing world
"God, the most spoiled club in the world cannot stop bitching."
"Real Madrid is a disgusting club.

For a lot of reasons.

But the biggest is knowing that there will be zero repercussions for whenever they do something wrong. And hell to pay for whoever they accuse of doing something wrong.

Typical bullying behavior."
"Maybe unpopular opinion apparently, but I don't think refs should have spoken like that before a literal final. 

I want to make clear that by that I don't mean they aren't right in what they say, in fact I agree with them and totally think RM should be punished by that huge pile of bs RMTV is, and they should end the pathetic victimism campaign against referees. It's outrageous and unfit not only for freaking Real Madrid, but for any professional club even in lower categories.

Especially considering how they didn't even act in court against Barcelona's Negreira case, which was huge and scandalous af, so they must not truly feel like victims at all, do they? This is just some ridiculous acting against referees to sel lthemselves as victims of a conspiracy or some shit.

But as I said at the start, the referees doing this just the day before a final is going to do nothing but fuel the fires even more, let alone if there's even a single error against Real Madrid."
Generational crying.
"This shit is hilarious. 

This entire meltdown just to get smashed by Barcelona again because there’s no way they’re forfeiting and giving Barcelona a trophy without playing. 

Fucking fascists lmao."
If the ref is so bad then forfeit please and thank you
Literal schoolyard bully behavior. Embarrassing club.
What an incredibly embarrassing and insufferable club
"A sick Pathetic club, bullies the guy for whole week before the final then act surprised when he reacts, wtf?"
"real madrid is genuinely such a shameful, childish and disgusting club man 😭"
Thank God I despise that disgusting and hideous “club”
What the fuck are these pricks moaning and whining about now?
Real madrid make even City and barca are so likeable for neutral fans. The most deservedly disliked club in all of Europe. And to think there 15 time champions of Europe. Embarrassing for Europe actually.
Such a cringe club. Beyond embarrassing 
The club is a reflection of it's fanbase. Take a look at r/realmadrid and see what their stance on this issue is. The vast majority of posts and comments supports the club's actions because the ref in question once sent Vinicius off the pitch.
"Imagine claiming to be one of the greatest football clubs on the planet with unmatched levels of awards and a long history of employing some of the greatest players the game has ever seen, just to be acting like a spoiled, victim-card-playing brat when everyone on this planet doesn’t agree with you or dares to critize you when you’re own communications department is acting like a total numpties. Like c’mon, have some dignity and pride, and some belief in your team’s ability to overcome challenges instead of crying like a kid who just got nutmegged for the fifht time by their older brother. This behaviour is so embarrasing and childish coming from a big club like Real."
"Real bullying a ref before a game. Ref cries infront of Media at press confress. Says that he is worried for his son now. Real blames Ref. Real demands a new ref, because the ref is not neutral. 

Welp Real. Are they hoping for a better ref? Maybe one that they paid off before? Maybe one who has ""helped"" Real in the past? Maybe one that was who was on Real's ""side""?"
How is Madrid shitting their pants before the game even began? This is petulance of the highest order.
This club is starting to be annoying. I blame this on Perez dude is beefing with everybody
"Real are the spoiled little princess who refuses to accept they are wrong on any level and blames everyone else for their mistakes.

The Spanish FA need to come down hard on them. Put them in their place and shut them up."
Make no mistakes Arsenal would be doing the same thing if EPL wasn’t strict with criticising referees.
Couples shouldn't fight in public
Just ban them from football PLEASE
Real Madrid haven't been this obnoxious since Mourinho
Madrid is a joke
Madrid keeps doing this shit because it works and they're allowed to
The Madrid cesspool of a subreddit are so delusional lmao. Saying the ref started a “holy war” against them. He came out and defended his position because of the slander on RMTV and clearly said that he’s always striving to make better decisions. Idk how it can be interpreted in such a negative light as they are other than delusion and simply not even reading or listening to the statement that THEIR club caused because of their shitty propaganda. Victim complex to the max.
I just lost all respect for this club. Used to like them. I guess I'll be cheering for Bilbao and Betis now. What the hell is the matter with these megalomaniacs? Disgusting
What a crybaby club
Real Madrid finally accepting that they're scumbags.
Is a shame that la liga is so dependent on Madrid (as well as barca) that nothing will be done to them.
"When did RM become such little bitches? Stop whining, shut your mouth, get on with the job."
Just regla madred things
Hands down the most toxic club with the most toxic (and idiotic) fanbase
How is it possible they aren't being suspended or anything like that?
The only way this shit is going to stop is if they throw Real Madrid out of the Copa del Rey and award a walkover to their opponents. Fines aren't going to be enough. But that would require the Spanish authorities to have a backbone.
"Biggest club ( in revenue), smallest in everything that matters."
"I hope Barca drum these lot, such whiny bitches"
Real Madrid really is the Israel of football clubs lmao
So we’re all Barcelona tomorrow
I cannot believe people are defending these actions.
"I'm Portuguese, I grew up idolising Ronaldo and watched every Madrid game of that era and normally still cheer for them against Barça.

This might be the first time I'm cheering for Barça to wipe down the floor with them."
Entitled bunch. They help Barca their rival even more with giving them more rest lmao
This is embarrassing
They really pulled out a Comunicado Oficial
They’re so pathetic
embarrassing
"Madrid should consider signing a new PR department in the next transfer window.

The Ballon d'Or drama, the Copa final drama, and the RMTV rants coming from a club that would like to lecture others about 'señorio' and claiming  to be 'the greatest sporting institution in the world'. It's just so childish and embarrassing."
This club is like a cheap telenovela
This club is so lost it‘s not even funny.
Have RM tried simply not being cunts?
[COMUNICADO OFICIAL] All of reddit considers Real Madrid being such crybabies to be unacceptable
Congratz Real Madrid on winning the Clownpions League 2024/2025
Vile club. The statement is actually stupid. Inherently stupid.
Real Madrid is the Donald Trump of football. What a joke of a club.
"Insufferable twats , remontada my ass"
"this is an evil club, i don't care what anyone says"
"Real Madrid really went ""stop hitting yourself"" on the RFEF."
Is Real a serious organization? I’ve never witnessed such lack of professionalism and tact in my life.
Absolutely pathetic club in every single aspect
What losing to Arsenal does to a motherfucker lmao
Bully sad that their victim outed their bullying ways
A day before the final. Just wow
True fascist club
"Really shows the support they have for Vini, they turned the whole club into a Brazilian Serie C shitshow"
Fascist club gonna fascist club
All this to lose 5-0 against Barca again
"Perpetual victims, you’ll never sing that"
Never thought i'd be rooting for barca. Please smash them
"From ""Europe be scared"" to peeing their pants because of something a ref said 😭😭😭"
The comments in the RM subreddit on this topic are pathetic. People shitting on the ref and basically saying it's deserved because he sent of Vini Jr.
Embarrassing.
"Oh man, what is this club doing? This will be an el classico for the ages. Get your popcorn ready!"
"Madrid had several embarassing media campaign this season, i don't understand how could this happen, this is supposedly ""well run club"".  
  
  From throwing tantrum by not congratulating Spanish Ballon D'or winner to bullying not one but two referees and their children, forcing them TO make public appearance to plead for their children.  
   
Why? This cannot be the image they would want to project. Or is it?"
Someone staple shut Florentino’s gob please
Yea something needs be done about this bratty club awful bunch
"If I were the ref I’d just start handing out red cards to Real Madrid for every little foul there is. 


I’m not a professional of course but I’d finish the game by handing a red card to Perez and a solid middle finger."
"Just now from Tebas:


This isn't football, it's power grabs.

❌ He doesn't like Tebas because he doesn't do what he wants.
❌ He doesn't like Ceferin because he doesn't do what he wants.
❌ He doesn't like Louzán because he doesn't do what he wants.
❌ He doesn't like TV commentators because they don't say what he wants.
❌ They don't want progress on refereeing reform because it's not what he wants.
(...)
And now, after the referees' statements—fed up with the constant harassment from Real Madrid TV—he responds as he knows how:
🚫 He cancels the press conference.
🚫 He skips training at La Cartuja.
🚫 He disregards the official Copa final events.
🚫 He leaks that he won't be showing up for the Copa final.
What thin skin.
He doesn't protest, he puts pressure on.

He doesn't complain, he threatens.
He doesn't disagree, he punishes.
He doesn't want to improve football, he wants his own football.
And the worst thing isn't that he tries.
The worst thing is that many allow it, condone it, and help him."
"Real Madrid are the redditors of football, they always want to be victims"
Real Madrid is an embarrassment
Real Madrid are embarrassing themselves
Just give us the trophy already they obviously don't want it
"Are they serious? 


You fuckin attack the refs for years and when those refs say what they think about your smear campaign, you go cry about it? 


Shameless."
Please don't forfeit the game. Think about how upset our kids will be.
what public comments? that he was crying due to being unfairly criticized before the game even happened? how was it anymore unacceptable than making a whole ass video about an individual ref before the game??
"are they really doing this much over a Copa del Rey match

Imagine Arsenal doing all this because they got Michael Oliver in the FA Cup"
"Spain needs new refs, all terrible"
"Even the ref parrot sings Real Madrid anthem, but they still cry about referee. Pathetic."
"God damn this shit is embarrassing as a Madrid fan, just shut the fuck up and let them play if something happens during the game that is unfair you have every right to complain about it then but until the ref actually makes a bad call you have to just roll with whoever gets assigned and see how it plays out."
Usual games from Real. They deserve what Barça are going to do to them tomorrow.
what’s happening… context pls
Gracias dios que no soy madridista
when u thought them not going to ballon d'or cus vini didnt won was a shit show now they go even farther what a true shit show it is now xD
They should just forfeit the match in protest
Some “King Von Once Said end gun violence” energy right there
"Bruh, just play the game and stop bitching"
"Here in Seville for my girlfriends birthday, ended up finding out the final was here so got tickets 😂 paid £300 per ticket but they're legit from viagogo."
This club is so fucking annoying🤦‍♀️
All this just to get shit on tomorrow. Embarrassing
A telenovela...
What a shame.  Oh well.
Such a fucking scummy club. So embarrassing
cry baby FC
What a rotten club.
Sigh. What are Real Madrid mewling about now?
What a shitshow
Everyone hates Madrid
"This is now getting embarrassing. Madrid you are the most successful club, behave like one.

I wonder what goes inside Perez's mind."
The worst club on the planet. They get away with the biggest bullshit
They’re free to forfeit
Thank God I am not supporting this shit of a club 🙏
Barca I know we've had our issues in the past but just give them the biggest spanking of their life I beg you.
"I'm enjoying this shitshow tbh, at least this time is not us"
This is some *real* whinging right here.
Oh do fuck off
I hate Real that I have to root for Barca...
With the oil state ownerships you really do forget just what a bunch of spoiled kids Madrid are.
"Antagonizing the person who will arbitrate the major decisions on the pitch, on the day where you competing for a trophy, is certainly one of the choices of all time"
What childish behavior from a prof club let alone a club as big as real. Shameful disgusting behavior
Lmao this is so embarassing for Real Madrid
Football heritage
Entitled Madrid FC!!!!!
Not a good look for RM.
"For such a big club, they are such a little club."
"Real Madrid really need to learn some humility.  
This is beyond embarrassing, same as the Vini Balon D'Or snub.  
The club acting like this is why the players are becoming supremely unlikeable as well."
"Just laying the groundwork to blame the officiating if they get absolutely wrecked tomorrow or simply lose a close game.

Shameful. And the fact that RMTV also does nothing but attack the league and officials is shameful.

Madrid has no one to blame but themselves for some of their underwhelming performances this season. Take some accountability."
"As a madridista, this is not the way. Never has been."
RM has some of the most big mouthed/unfair players and staff that are simultaneously the biggest crybabies. They should really work on their public relations.
Literally wtf
Man Perez has lost it it seems.
Señorío. Floper is going nuts
"I am a Madrid fan. The super league was never going to work because Perez (and a large portion of our fans) would have never accepted the parity that a closed system would create. 

Even the Yankees and the Lakers have had seasons where they were among the worst in their leagues. Imagine the meltdown from him if Real had an a truly bad season, where we weren’t finishing third but finishing *last.*"
"Just got into this. 

But in short RM is harassing a ref they don't like to the point his kid is being bullied at school?  By posting all his mistakes the last years?   
And doing another boycott to get their way?"
What a little bitch organization RM is
Can anyone tell me the context??
This whole shit show will have a big impact on how the refs are treated in amateur football. A disgrace.
Don't dish shit out if you can't take any... Club for bullies & little whiny bitches.
one of the reasons why everyone hates these shitheads.
Russian behaviour
Every statement coming from this club sounds like a spoiled toddler throwing a tantrum
"Yeah it is.

Not attending to Ballon Dor gala because Vini didn't win.  
Attacking referees in RMTV after each game.  
Threatening to not play CdR final because referee said he feels bullied.

Papa Perez acts like he's 5 year old baby lately. Ancelotti should not play those stupid games and just do what he's paid to do - play the fucking game. Specially now when he's goin to get sacked so he can at least stand up and go out with dignity."
Honestly sad that the club I’ve supported for decades has done this. It’s like a little child throwing tantrums for not getting what they want.
"Where's the ""señorio"" we used to be so proud about? Shameful."
You guys are officially the worst club of 2025. That's saying a LOT!
"I've always liked Real Madrid and I admire their sports achievements, but this is unacceptable and terrible."
They're such divas top to bottom
You guys are embarrassing! The entire world is watching and RM is showing its real side.. a whiny entitled bragging twat! It’s so painful to watch!
"Your club makes it so easy to hate them

like for real

Absolute childish behaviour"
"Top voted comment, by a Madrid flair, says this shit is embarrassing. Peak"
That’s your club.
What did the ref say?
"So genuine question for the Madridistas: when it was RM TV (an official club channel btw) it was supposed to be a ""shitpost"" and that ""nobody pays attention to it anyway"". Does this make it clear that it's not simply RM TV, but likely a directive coming from the club? And if so how would you expect _anyone_ -let alone the refs- to respond to this bullying?

Just to be clear, not saying that other teams (Barca included) don't cry for refereeing through social media and various players/owners etc. And I also know that I myself have been in marches against corruption in refereeing in Cyprus, albeit a lot different as there were actual evidence."
"""When you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression"""
Real Madrid should be given a Red Card and start the match a man down.
That's what happens when the RFEF president is a madridista
Why is the real madrid filled with crybabies?
"They don’t like criticism too, just got banned from their sub for pointing out that their club’s behavior is borderline toxic lol"
Biggest clu… embarrassment in football.
"I cannot fucking believe how absolutely *pathetic* Real Madrid are, and have been for quite some time now (e.g. Ballon d'Or)"
"RFEF or whoever is in charge of the running of the Cup should stand their ground, call Madrid's bluff."
"Just a typical bully response. Bullies bully people that won’t fight back, and then turn out to be massive weaklings when someone does."
Many Madrid fans are supporting Perez on r/realmadrid for this . Like how shit and disgraceful a club and its fan base can be
their fans on twitter acting like it's them vs the world... how does a club and fanbase get so delusional ?
"“We are more united than ever with Medina Cantalejo. We’re going to have to take stricter measures than the ones we’re taking now. In coming days, you’ll see that we’ll make history""

yeah this is totally ok"
Typical Real mentality
Harass refs then act shocked when said ref talks about it???
These guys stink!
"We can't get enough of these circus clowns, can we?"
Please just win 5-0 and be done with this. Then we win next week and celebrate with you. What an embarassment.
"One of the comments from the realmadrid subReddit:

“In the real world, what happens to a businessman who commits fraud or steals money? He faces consequences—fines, prison, disgrace. But these referees? They steal points, trophies, and integrity from Real Madrid week after week, yet they’re protected like untouchables.

‘Puzzi’ referees like this one don’t deserve respect—they deserve accountability. No wonder he`s son was bullied in school; some people only understand power when it’s used against them.

Enough excuses. Enough ‘there’s no good solution.’ If the system won’t punish them, we will. No mercy, no surrender. WE ALL KNOW THE SYSTEM IN SPAIN IS HORRIBLE”"
"Isn't this just Perez, acting through the club?"
"barça gets a 3-0 w/o win 


would be hilarious indeed"
"Yes, this will create the biggest mockery in history  for club football xD. 

Their whole existence as a ‘so called royal club’ will be turned to ashes"
100% dodgy red/pen coming via VAR
Decisions going Madrid’s way because atp I’d fear for my life if I was the ref
"Same, I hope de Burgos has the strength to not let this sway how he calls the game tomorrow. If bullying like this is allowed to work we’re in a bad spot."
Any ref who dares to give a 50/50 call against them would risk ruining his and his Family's entire life
"i’m even more confident now lol.

Madrid seem rattled."
In what sense ? Drama is spicing it for me tbh
"You shouldn't. RM claimed for years that the Copa is worthless, when Barça won it every year, and their own 'world-beater' team kept crashing out. Now Braça are frying a bigger fish in the league and the UCL. If RM wins, they got a worthless cup, after harassing the ref for it. If they lose, they will look 10x more ridiculous. They were always gonna blame the ref if they lost, RMTV or not, that's nothing new"
I’m not worried lol this is hilarious to me
"If one of the players from Madrid dares to injure Yamal, there will be hell to pay. And there will be blood."
Holy shit this comment is comedy gold 😂
Real sacrifices themselves for peak entertainment. They should continue with it
And most entitled.
Just cringe with how the team through a tantrum when vini jr lost the balón d’or. Just embarrassing.
They never act like it. More like the most hated club in the world.
"biggest, yes. Greatest, no"
"> greatest

In which department, exactly? Winning UCL's and having the most supporters from Brazil? Sure. Cultural history and youth setup? They have a history tied to fascism and would rather spend their money on superstars than invest in their own.

There are so many different aspects to a club beyond just winning European cups and having lots of supporters. Ridiculous to call them the greatest club."
"Real when given a penalty every other game: 
🙈🙉🙊"
why stop there
no let them forfeit so we have time to tone Lamine's hair before inter
"Forfeit would be so nice but I know that it won’t happen. El Classico in final is too much attention and too much money to be made for the league, la liga is going to do anything to make this match happen, I wouldn’t be surprised if they bend over and change the referee tomorrow morning. Forfeit would do Barca a lot of favour, because then they can rest for Inter."
"or 1:0 with a dodgy pen at 90+3 just to kick this shitshow to a whole other level... 

De Burgos would prob have to go into Witness protection tho, so thats the downside"
Their heads were gone in the second leg against us. I can't even imagine how bad they'd be 2-0 down or more 😂
"For real, please, I beg you, trash these babies"
"But if they walked out, it'll be only a 3-0 defeat

\*guy tapping forehead meme\*"
Why can't they just be intimidated and favor Madrid under the tacit threat of fan violence and professional repercussions?
"what do they even want to achieve with this statement? 

the statement doesn't clarify anything. They don't even mention what the actual problem was today. Neither do they mention what should happen. They also don't mention what Real Madrid will do if these stuff doesn't happen."
The other side of the issue is that they are doing this with no repercussions whatsoever. They have done this multiple times and there have been no sanctions of notable worth. It's such a joke.
"If they don't show up, I believe Barca has to play Real Sociedad, as per rules."
Our men can rest properly too before CL
"Bully wants an apology from the person they bullied, it doesn't get better than this 😂"
90 minutes is a long time in RMTV
90 minutes is a long time for a referee
"At this point, who are they not looking at with anger in their eyes? Too bad they don’t show that anger in the way they play."
"The most repeated word in the dressing room is ""cambiar la referencia"""
Thank fucking fuck you guys knocked ’em out.
Why respectfully though?
"No, we are Real Madrid, we don’t know what shame is."
-3 points for Ecuador
">Even more surprising statements, in a threatening tone, alluding to the referees' unity, were used to announce alleged measures or actions that fall far short of the principles of fairness, objectivity, and impartiality that should prevail just hours before a football event that captures the attention of hundreds of millions of people around the world.

genuine question, no one is talking about any threats from the ref. so what threats is Real Madrid complaining against?"
"Trying to deflect the fact that squad planning was a failure this season and thus we're not winning anything, you can only blame the manager so much before everyone realizes he isn't the main problem."
I’ve got a massive watch party planned so I care. Looking forward to a shit show off a match.
There's also no way that all this circus isn't having an effect (negative one) on their own players.
It’s gonna be fun watching them ass fucked by Barcelona
Love how we are calling everybody fascist now
"Literally the sorest winners in world football, even if things go their way they still find a way to cry"
"They can’t, without Real Madrid La Liga would essentially go bankrupt "
And this is a perfect example as to why it's right to be strict on criticising referees. And right that they don't give interviews.
"The RM sub is full of them. People shitting on the ref and saying he deserves it because apparently saying ""we'll make history"" is a threat. And oh, he sent off Vini Jr. that one time."
A forfeit gets them a 0-3 result. Best one for them this season!
Mentality losers!
"On the other hand, glad they're finally admitting what they are."
"I mean.. 

I wouldn't be surprised if Perez wears diapers from time to time"
"Worlds most successful club. Worlds most persecuted and unfairly treated club, according to themselves."
Literally the Donald Trump of football at this rate 😂
Real Madrid sound like the golden child of a family (laliga) when they dont get their way.
Madrid has lost so much class in recent years and this has been a long time coming. Remember when they broke the tradition of having a guard of honour a few years ago?
Perez reminds me of Trump
That's how you know they mean business! Wait until they threaten to *close the roof*!
"Typical aristocracy tbh, easy to play at grace while aggrandizing yourself according to your own sensibilities while you feel like the world is bending over for you "
Was never there. Remember your “club legends” Pepe and Ramos? Embodied everything your club stands for.
He was talking about his son getting bullied at school because of the unfair slander thrown his way by Madrid.
">So genuine question for the Madridistas: when it was RM TV (an official club channel btw) it was supposed to be a ""shitpost"" and that ""nobody pays attention to it anyway"". Does this make it clear that it's not simply RM TV, but likely a directive coming from the club?

I appreciate the kind tone of your question but they always knew. That was never an argument made in good faith, just a deflection to save face, and they'll find another.

RMTV would never broadcast anything against the interests of Florentino and Madrid's management. And if it did (for lack of supervision, a rogue editor, whatever) they would've been quick to reject it officially. Instead, they've been putting pressure on referees the whole season from both their in-house media and the rest of the outlets they have massive influence on (Marca, Chiringuito, etc.) This always was the official line and Madridistas know it very well."
"The channel has always operated according to the club's wishes. Anyone claiming otherwise is just trying to white knight for the club.

The stuff about viewership used to be true—and probably still is—but in the age of social media, everything gets shared to an incredibly large audience. So that narrative is just a silly way to deflect from the actual issue: the videos themselves.

Honestly, I don’t know what referees could realistically do in response. Maybe boycotting Real Madrid matches if RM TV targets them, but that would probably just lead to even more abuse.

The RFEF needs to step in and protect the referees, but so far, they’ve done absolutely nothing. This press conference could have—and still can—been a catalyst to start that process. But Pablo González Fuertes kind of messed it up with his comments, which only escalated things further on Madrid’s side.

Hopefully, whoever is pushing this pressure campaign finally realizes that referees are people too, and puts an end to this shameful nonsense."
"Everyone knows it comes from the club directly. Which makes it even worse. It's not a kid handling the club twitter account on their own because it's a small team and ""they don't have time for that"". It's a fucking monster, in all possible terms.

I'm personally fucking tired of RMTV and it's shenanigans... I'm just ashamed of it.

RMTV: ""fuck refs. And fuck the refs of our next match in particular.""

Refs: ""that's wrong, and it mustn't happen""

RM: *<surprised pikachu face>*"
"Idk who you spoke to but the overwhelming majority of us on the sub do not like this RMTV shit. La Liga refereeing definitely sucks, and La Liga leadership sucks, but going after these dudes personally is fucking weird personal Perez petty billionaire shit."
"Most of them will be silent, we are talking about a very large fan base that mainly supports them due to them winning a lot. They are always going to be a very brutal fan base to talk too."
"The whole RM TV is fucking cringe imo. I've felt this way since it was a ""shitpost"" and was never a big fan of it. I just wanna keep supporting the team I grew up watching, but the constant drama they pull off doesn't help."
"As a Madridista, I’m not ok with it. It damages the integrity of the game and the club. I want to win on merit, not based on bullying or meddling. I want my players to work hard for the badge and pull off incredible plays based on performance. Clubs should not be “Shit posting” or publicly complaining about specific referees. The referee and the referee association has every right to respond and push back.

In general though, I think refereeing needs to be much more transparent in the sport, like the way rugby does it. There needs to be more consistency on calls and how VAR intervenes and influences refs and all of this should be completely transparent."
"genuine answer, it's clear that RMTV was stirring the pot and was hoping for an inflammatory answer, which imo they exactly got. one of the VAR refs fell for the bait and made some comments that in my opinion question how impartial he is going to be in the match. obviously this is self-inflicted as well, but the fact stands that RMTV threw out the bait and at least one ref ended up taking it."
"Idk how the RMTV functions and who feeds it instructions because I dont watch it but whoever it is should stop this embarassing propaganda. We as a club should be above this and take the high road. Its embarassing and unfitting of the name of our club. 

That being said: 
- Holding referee press conference before the game is stupid for multiple reasons. 
- The only reason to appeal to ""children bullied"" is to elicit emotional response. Might sound harsh but RMTV didnt bully the child, other children did. 
- Idk why everyone is so appaled by RMTV calling the ref a thief. At least where Im from, basically everyone calls ref thieves when shit doesnt go their way. Yes its unfitting for RMTV to do it but lets not pretend every single one of us never called some ref a thief. 
- RMTV behaviour is appaling, the ref behaviour is unprofessional and 95% of people complaining about this are just happy Madrid is acting like children and doesnt care about sport integrity at all."
"When you're accustomed to mega privilege, just normal privilege feels like oppression."
"Well, with a competent referee they already are a man down..."
"Something that needs to be pointed out: this is far from the first time RMTV started a campaign against referees, this was happening even during Rubiales' tenure. They just never got punished for it, and here we are. 

And I think at this point we all know they lack the balls to actually forfeit but every single time a wind blows tomorrow, there will be RM player rolling on the ground and a whole bunch of useful idiots abusing the referee for not calling a foul."
Wonder why he didn't have time to read his favourite club's official announcement before a huge match
"So tired of this unfounded rumor. Do better, not everything is a conspiracy."
"I agree with the argument that he may be biased against Real Madrid.

That should be a protected bias though - the consequence of RM initiating and participating in the bullying of this man and his family.

Otherwise, with the dire state of the internet, clubs would have an incentive to terrorize refs so that they could control who officiated their matches."
A very obvious example of that in today's political world.
They are brainwashed fan base what do you expect
I would invite you to go into the posts and read some of the comments. Not everyone is agreeing with this. Many users in the sub are calling it embarrassing and pathetic.
"thats a sad bunch of users in a sub anyways

ive seen people celebrating injuries in the ot (yes dickheads i know how to differentiate between sarcasm and real statements)"
As much as possible! Like they always are
And then they say why every one hates their club
"I mean they’re also adopting the narrative «the worst Real Madrid in recent years is only 4pts behind the best Barcelona in recent years».

They forgot that they’re current Liga+UCL champions and added Mbappe."
"A lot of fans mean a big echochamber. It happens on here too, match threads with a big and small team get dominated by the bigger one. The smaller club's fans get downvoted just for supporting their club."
They really are the Israel of football
The club reflects the fans reflect the club…
Lmaooooooo this is some fresh copypasta material
"If my future kid ever grows up to behave like this, I must’ve failed horribly as a parent."
I mean it's not an exact reflection of what's going on in that sub but whoever made this comment should forever hang their head in shame. What a load of crap. Justifying bullying a kid because their father made a couple of mistakes at the job is another kind of low.
"I don’t like cherry picking comments from a subreddit to paint a picture about the entire demographic. 

Every subreddit has their fair share of lunatics. What’s telling to me is the silence and complicity of their socios withstanding from condemning this behavior."
A majority of the comments are calling this whole thing embarrassing…
"Perez *is* the club. Whoever comes after him will pretty much have to be Perez-approved, anyway."
"It's not *just* Pérez (if you know the club as an org they genuinely are this entitled) but definitely a top-down thing for sure. RMTV wouldn't dream of broadcasting anything that goes against the public messaging guidelines of their Dark Lord.

There have been voices more critical about this kind of behavior close to the team (famously Valdano) but they were ostracised and purged over time for not being blindly loyal enough."
"They're synonymous at this point. It's like criticising America in Iraq and saying ""that's just Bush acting as head of state"""
"Well their main reference is Santiago Bernabeu, a former military fascist accomplice of the murder of 500k innocent democrats, that was appointed by Franco after executing the republican Real Madrid president Antonio Ortega."
"Real Madrid will come out Mourinho/Bordalas style no football will be played, they will contest every single call and the referee will be too scared to pull a red card."
Could be any Madrid game tbf. Only team I’ve ever seen have VAR disallowed a penalty in a fucking shootout.
Nah no native Spaniards are truly about that action. Keyboard warriors only
">I’d fear for my life if I was the ref

I don't think anyone has to be worried about being killed lmao just humiliated publically which is enough to sway decisions in favor of RM"
"It's also a bad precedent, depending on how tomorrow's match goes (if it even happens), it might end with a terrible loss for Barca but an even bigger loss for football as we know it"
"Only in LaLiga my friend, imagine a club did this in the EPL, it would be absolutely insane."
You’re also gonna have Yamal on Mendy who hasn’t played in like a month and a half. And as solid as Fede is at RB he’s going to have his hands full with raphinha
"I’m worried this is exactly what they want to do; take the players’ heads out of the game and into fighting with the referee. They know without stirring things up we are the favorites, so they want to throw a wrench in things."
"Yeah if you are a neutral it must be great, for a Barca fan its probably quite worrying seeing all this pressure being put on refs 24h before the final. Like obviously you can feel good about your odds on the field, but all it takes is a close game with some difficult calls for the ref and the final can be tainted. 

Sure, if one side wins convicingly its whatever, but if there is any sort of controversy it will either confirm Real's paranoia and encourage them to press on even harder - if it goes Barca's way - or it will show Real that harrasing refs works - if the call goes their way. Either way, unless they get punished and things change, its bad for the game in general."
"i think he means worried as in ""I worry it might not happen at all"" in which case any amount of spice is whatever."
"I mean, I hate them as much as I could but how are they not the greatest?"
Undoubtedly the greatest 
Easily the greatest lol. The European record speaks for itself 
Barca legit could have gotten a historic result before Tek got a red in the supercup
"We always shoot ourselves in the foot when were in the position to spank them into the history books. Just how it goes. That 0-4 at the Bernabeu with Xavi a few years ago when it easily couldve been 0-7 if it wasnt for multiple missed sitters and 1v1s, the 5-2 recently where Tek got a red card. 

Were cursed to never go past 5 at this point."
Poor Lamine got his hair done just for Madrid to forfeit 💔💔 think of the children Perez
"Real Sociedad fans: ""Excellent"""
"""Have you said thank you once??""  
~~— JD Vance~~  
— Florentino"
Dick Cheney shit
Flair checks out
"Gónzalez Fuerte, VAR referee tomorrow: “We are more united than ever with Medina Cantalejo. We’re going to have to take stricter measures than the ones we’re taking now. In coming days, you’ll see that we’ll make history.”  
  
Supposedly this is what the club has the problem with."
How dare Don Carlo not make this team work without Kross and Carvajal 😡
Losing class implies they ever had any.
Yeah unlike mighty Dani Alves and Piqué
"Small correction but he wasn't talking about his son, but an unnamed colleague's from what I heard of the press conference"
That’s not the statement they’re talking about. The other ref said something along the lines of “The refs stand in solidarity with Medina Cantalejo & we will make history in the coming weeks. We will take stricter measures.” After being asked by RMTV videos.
"Thats not why Madrid is mad tho, its because the other ref said they would be taking “measures”"
"I do agree and as I said in another comment it baffles my mind how their club can be so successful and yet feel so ok with an _official_ club channel essentially bullying the refs throughout the past 2 seasons and now doubling down with an _official official_ response. As I said I have family in Madrid and the fans there are almost 100% behind Perez and the board in this. 

I just don't get it"
"> Instead, they've been putting pressure on referees the whole season from both their in-house media and the rest of the outlets they have massive influence on (Marca, Chiringuito, etc.)

This hasn’t been the case this season alone. It’s been going on for quite a while. Which is even more pathetic. The topic kind of blew up this season."
They even forced La Sexta to open fucking El Rojo Vivo a couple of times to whine about the referees.
"Exactly. When I first saw the attacks on the referee on social media, i thought this was the usual shit posting by the madridistas, which the fanbase of every club tried to attempt more or less.. but finding out that the official RMTV publishing this shit is slamdunk bullying and is annoying to me as a Real madrid supporter."
"Look I get fan bases having their clubs backs and I get it 1000x more for actual football and sports clubs such as Madrid who are owned by their fans. However, there must be a line where you as a fan can come forward and criticize your president/board. 

I just spoke to a family member in Madrid and he is absolutely appalled by this behaviour but as far as both understand he is in the vast minority of the people. For example his dad is fully behind Perez and there is a very prominent sentiment of them being hunted by the refs/RFEF/Tebas etc. 

And apparently their reasoning is somehow ""free speech"". Like this is the most important thing of this issue, free speech."
They are not silent. They are just preparing for the horde in the real Madrid subreddit
"Reminder that there are more than twice as many Real Madrid fans than there are Spanish people on /r/soccer

https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/11d9488/rsoccer_2023_census_results_in_which_country_were/

https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/11xq0lr/rsoccer_2023_census_results_which_football_clubs/"
Almost fell for it
"Man, you’re having a good time with that account name these days!"
"You're right, i apologise to Your ~~Royal~~ Majesty"
Yeah it would be a bad precedent to set that you can bully a ref and cry that he’s biased against you because of it and get your way.
Sadly the majority are saying the ref deserved to cry over it. It's a cesspool over there.
"Sure, not everyone. But definitely the majority. The top comments are all in support of their club's embarrassing decision and even undermining the ref"
I actually see a lot of criticism for RM's begaviour from users there
"honestly their league position flatters them, it's like us last season, we were a 14th place team saved by luck and individual brilliance"
IsReal Madrid 
dont let r/worldnews see this
Now that's a great comparison.
Are Atleti Hamas?
It's gonna be like putin putting in Medvedev for a term
"Perez is akin to a Murdoch, though I’m unsure who their Ailes would be."
You mean Bordalas (60)?
"Man if I were the ref I'd be fucking them over 

Though I guess I'm not thinking about the harassment and danger from the fans."
Guy was crying about his kids getting shit in school. Clearly native Spaniard *kids* at least are about that
What makes a native Spaniard different from the native “wherever” the keyboard warrior is from
Aren't native Spaniards infamous for being racist hatemongers who burn effigies and hang them from bridges? I'm sure they're capable of being more than just keyboard warriors.
"I hate being heavy favourites, if we dont win its even worse"
There isn’t going to be much pressure on Fede’s wing since balde isn’t going to play and Gerard Martin isn’t good enough. So honestly I expect that Fede is going to have a good game.
"Raphinha's still banged some important goals, but he really hasn't looked himself the past few weeks in the general play. In terms of chance creation, I think Barcelona will be limited on the left flank. I also feel like the offside defense hasn't been as reliable lately, especially with Araujo back and seeing more playtime. The key difference will be the midfield battle; Pedri's been in unstoppable form, and it will depend on how well Madrid can overcome his press resistance. 

I'm ironically expecting a much more even game than the previous Clasicos, because Barca just haven't look quite as sharp lately as they've been throughout the season."
">for a Barca fan its probably quite worrying seeing all this pressure being put on refs 24h before the final.

Mate, this has going on for decades. Shit is just another Tuesday."
"Im Barca fan, and this makes it extra special to beat Madrid after whining like crybabies tbh, but also makes it a little bit more sour if we lose, stakes are high"
“Greatest” is a designation without objective meaning.
"No, that would be Ajax"
Camavinga should have had a red way before Wojtek's outing. Ref kinda saved them that game.
"this situation is hilarious because it’s honestly deflecting from how hard Barca have cooked Madrid all season, if i didn’t know any better i’d say this is them trying to create a preemptive excuse if they get destroyed again tomorrow"
Who is Tek?
i really wanted balde and lewa to play tmrw ... but hopefully we destroy them again .
"I've seen enough.

Florentino-Carlos 2028"
"I see, weird that the refs held a press conference... 



anyways, well this is pathetic no matter what..."
"thanks for claryfing, it would really help if this discussion on this subreddit would be led by native speakers or at least people who read more than headlines. so much false narratives are spread here its insane"
"Stricter measures seems to imply they will be challenging Madrids stance, they are clearly trying to influence referees and the federation, which could be found in breach of multiple rules"
Who is the other ref? Is he set to be involved in the game?
"This is not just an official channel. Real Madrid and Florentino has a whole setup of media involving RM and pressure. There are journalists heavily tied to Real Madrid and/or Florentino, there are people in the football federation and the referee commitee heavily tied to RM or Florentino.

This is them putting pressure and threatening until the ones in power make the changes Floretino wants.

RMTV is usually the first to post and the one to blame so nobody can talk about Marca, A3media, TVE, Ok Diario, etc. Right now twitter has hundreds of RM accolytes, bot accounds and journos accounts adding more pressure.

Right now I'm seeing an image of tomorrow's referee while RM fans are saying that ""look, he's at camp nou, he has a Messi bag"" or something like that (the same happened with the referee on champions, but he had a RM bag, confirmed that one, by the way, nobody batted an eye, of course).

  
This has happened forever, nowadays is more noisy because RMTV has been completely unhinged for the past two years, COMPLETELY UNHINGED, but this is Spain's football every single week.

Every single week.

Made no mistake, is an apparatus pro Real Madrid."
"> I do agree and as I said in another comment it baffles my mind how their club can be so successful and yet feel so ok with an official club channel essentially bullying the refs throughout the past 2 seasons and now doubling down with an official official response.

success leads to power and power enables  impunity. RM does this because they can and also they usually get away with it."
It was the case even when we won the double. A pathetic obsession perez has had for a while now
"Long time madrid fan here, this stuff the club is doing is frankly fuckin dumb and is doing nothing but damage the reputation and if something, give the refs an actual reason to hold a grudge against us…"
Mods here are zionist too
Hamas wishes they could match the terrorism of el Cholo
Hamas if they really hated black people
Bordalas (61) I'll have you know
(60+13months) lil bro. Believe it or not he has a birthday.
Former 60-Year-Old Jose Bordalas.
" Dont underestimate the pressure from Perez imperium.

This already happend earlier in the season. Manuero Montero was witchhunted and everything they said about him was later proved to be false.

They were herrassing his whole family. His old mother, father and nieces and nephews."
">Though I guess I'm not thinking about the harassment and danger from the fans.

You are also not thinking about possible punishment/demotions"
Yep. This is where the game could be won and lost.
"Agreed. Balde is a big miss, maybe even more than Lewandowski. For me that’s a big part of Raphinha’s struggles — he works best when Balde can take care of the width and take on some deep progression responsibilities. That allows Raphinha to come inside without worrying."
I’m a real madrid fan and i hope barca demolishes madrid with the most outrageous calls from the referee
And neither is it pure subjective.
Club of the century is the only one you can't take away.
Great literally means big
"It's like R Kelly singing 'he's the greatest im the world's greatest"" look where he is now........ real Madrid are R Kelly"

Absolutely king
Eh fair enough
Based and Cruijff-pilled
Not really a crazy difference in this case though; still a child being bullied.
"slight difference, but he mentioned after, that in his case the only thing he can do is to tell his son that he is an honest person."
It's not really a key difference though. The point is that his referee job has lead to people attacking a child because he might have done a bad job.
I thought teams got a fine if they shitted ok the ref too much. They do in Belgium at least.
He'll be the VAR.
Jesus man fuck kinda cartoon villain is this club
"Well that would give some fire to your echo chambers tbh, it is bonkers you guys are making a big deal out of this while historically you have been helped the most by the referees"
Eh there have been 137 000 000 centuries by now
Do you call a big guy a great guy
Gràcies Johan moment
"I’ve just seen the quotes:

> VAR Fuertes added: ""Have no doubt that we are going to have to start taking much more serious measures than we are taking. We will not continue to allow what is happening. Soon, you will hear from us. We are going to make history, because we are not going to continue to bear what we are putting up with.""

He’s quite clearly talking about systemic rule changes with regards to conduct around clubs and referees. He’s not at all suggesting that they’re going to “take measures” against Real Madrid on the pitch, like the other guy heavily implied.

How very disingenuous."
True I guess dinosaurs FC would give us a run for our money
Okay name the club of the century from 100-200 AD
Well I can tell you which club wasn't Club of the Century 100-200 AD (Real Madrid)
Well I can tell you the only club with club of the century (Real Madrid). So maybe wait for another 75-76 years to give a decent reply

Most emotion I've seen from flick
RM TV condemns Hansi Flick's statement regarding the referees and demands FC Barcelona to change their coach.
"Thogden      🤝        Flick
         
           Calm down it’s 
             Only football"
Why is he at the press conference? Madrid made it clear they want the whole thing cancelled 😡
my pookie knows how to respond
The contrast in decency is actually astounding
"Real Madrid TV will say ""Flick should have ignored the question, not everything is about him"""
Flick please destroy those mafia entitled pieces of shit once again
RMTV to release a shocking exposé on how pro-Barca Flick is
very German response my glorious king.
"Flick just can't get any Ls, not only amazing coach, but also amazing person"
Easy tap in for Flick to be the good guy in this storyline
Easiest conference question he's been asked.
RM TV demands hansi flick to step down and lamine yamal to sign for another club because Vinicius Jr has locked himself in his room and they can hear crying near his house.
"Ref's are treat like shit, despite the fact there is no game without ref's. Ref's really should start striking over this bullshit."
"Flick: respect them

RMtv: hach thuuu"
PR disaster from Madrid. They look like little bitches
"People don’t realise how hard it is to be a referee. I did futsal for a while and sometimes you’d have to referee a match. I always hated it. People from both sides screaming at you when you get something wrong in their opinion, having to make the right call in a split second. It’s horrible. 

People don’t realise how shit you feel when people just scream at you because you made the wrong call, or when they get almost aggressive with you. People don’t realise how much the game hinges on the referee doing its job, and under jow much scrutiny a referee is. It’s really all eyes on the referee when he fucks something up. Now imagine that times 1000000 in a super big stadium + everyone in the world can see when you fucked up. Yeah, referees have to have balls."
Comunicado Oficial: Real Madrid are dumbfounded by the statement of Hans-Dieter Flick in the pre match press conference. They have demanded a change of manager because they believe the current manager will be detrimental to Real Madrid's interests.
It's always weird for me when I see a question not directly related to football asked to Flick. His answers are always obviously simple and clear. He answers politely but he absolutely doesn't care.
Easy tap in for my glorious king!
Respect for Flick and barca not following reals unreasonable demands and and their behavior
MILF (Man I Love Flick)
Flick is a good dude. I've always disliked Real Madrid and Barcelona but Flick (in response to Real Madrid's awfulness) is making me favor Barcelona like never before.
Class response from Hansi.
the spanish arne slot
"Conjugal visits? Not that I know of. Listen, reffing La Liga is no joke. I’ve got a client doing that right now. He says the trick is, kick someone’s ass or become someone’s bitch the first day."
"Yeah Hansi, you might notice it's not only football between these two."
Didnt one of his players verbally abuse a linesmen a week ago?
Age old relationship between Barca & refs continue
Saying this whilst coaching a team who's active president paid 8m euros to refs for sporting advantages is absolutely hilarious 🤣🤣
"Great, now a club that has a full history of corruption and shady business dealings are going to look like the good guys. 

Let's hope it doesn't fool anyone. Both clubs have had a long history of allegations and Barca are just as bad but the media has so much power that everyone will choose to ignore

It's the madrid board's own fault for allowing this happen, but whatever. When you've gone through every legal avenue to legally protest referee decisions and the FA doesn't listen to any suggestions to fix the referee situation, it's come down to this"
"Should have also added "" and its our responsibility because we pay the refs from the players salaries""😂"
"Hansi seemed to have loosened up after the German disaster, he seemed a lot more uptight at Bayern and Germany especially in pressers while at Barca he’s way more lighthearted"
Barcelona should lease Bayern Münich music sound when they scorer goals for tomorrow match.
🚨RM family has decided to protest against hansi flick.
Hilarious 😂
">>demands

who the fuck they think they are"
Not gonna lie I really think the end result of Madrids bullshit is going to be a massive advantage to yall when this all said and done
"Need a solid meme about RM laying down ‘the law’ for other leagues/competitions.

Fuck that, life in general."
Can someone sum this whole saga up for me? I keep seeing lots of half headlines and I am lacking full context but I really wanna laugh at Real Madrid
"It's only game, why you heff to be mad?"
Inb4 they demand Barcelona to sack Flick and appoint ancelotti jr
It'll be a truly sad day for all us Barca fans when he leaves
"He deserves credit for that decency regardless, but it would be genuinely difficult to take a position on this that looks as bad as RM does right now - or even close to it."
"Flick's always been a chill guy. Instructed the players in the beginning of the season to avoid fighting referees or opposing players. Think he dislikes all the referee discourse these days.

His press conferences are usually very composed. Tries to avoid mudslinging or excuses. Hasn't stopped the media from trying to malign him though. 

In his interview he was asked about Madrid complaining about the fixtures scheduling he said something along the lines of ""Im the Barca coach and proud of it, not Madrid coach"" and media twisted it to something like ""We are Barca, not Madrid, we don't complain about the schedule""."
madrid would make any scumbag seems like a lovely bloke so the bar isnt particularly high
"I think there is also the fact that Flick has genuinely been consistent on his position since day one. Barca got an incorrectly ruled offside in last year Real Sociedad game and he just said he wish to see their decision but he understand it is a hard job to do. Even when he was red carded, he did not make any hostile comment, just saying he still has a lot to learn himself."
What did Carlo say about it?
"You can not play this card man. Laporta and Xavi openly attacked referees last season after every game, you can not play the gentleman card now."
"Yep, unfortunately fans will still freely chuck around bias and corruption every time they don't agree with a decision, a terrible attitude that leads to bad things."
Scottish refs went on strike over this kinda thing I’m sure. Not sure it helped much tho.
It’s funny that everyone hates the refs until RM speaks up. RMTV is not doing Madrid any favors by turning the whole world against them. Referee incompetence is something all teams should be against TOGETHER
They are little bitches
"Transparency would go far in my opinion. Give you reasons for controversial calls, explain what you saw, explain rules, make VAR audio available. The problem is, there's no consistency in reffing. 

Take this year's Celta controversy. Ref explains what he saw from the field (I assume player looked like he didn't try to stay on feet). VAR explains why they didn't overturn it. Done.

Take Sevilla game couple years ago, that handed Atletico the championship. Explain why VAR intervened. The problem in this case is they missed two facts in favor of Militao.

Or explain why they didn't expel Romero in Espanyol game. 

Or explain why a foul after the shot is a penalty and it isn't another time."
"By way of Baden-Württemberg, Germany."
"Oh brother, where do we even begin...


Have you heard about RealMadridTV?"
going to r/soccer's hot feed will help you understand
just sort by top on this sub and you'll see everything
Yet no proof is going through whatsoever so Negreira only existed in Madris nightmares xzd
"Please enlighten us what came of that btw?

Why do we not hear the Negreira news anymore huh?"
Yes this is true I am the 8m euros
I guess barcelona is only broke when it suits the narrative you want 💁
"Barcelona bitches about referees, sure, but please point to me to the last time that the board:

* Created an entire TV program attacking a referee with whom we have a better win-rate than we do in general this season
* When the referee has a human reaction to said public harassment campaign, pretend that he's somehow the bad guy in this situation and demand that he get changed
* When the FA doesn't change the referee, cancel our practice and press conference, then threaten not to play the final of a major tournament

I'll wait."
"""but the media has so much power that everyone will choose to ignore...""




Bro, your own TV channel is the one making such allegations. Your media team."
Way to deflect brother.
Mbappe's one match ban for what could have been a leg-breaker. Fuck off
You guys are literally the DIDDY's of football
"I think there’s a different weight to managing the greatest team in your home country, versus managing the greatest team in a different county - even if it is the second greatest football team by history, which most of us would presume is the higher pressure situation.

When reading your domestic news, or discussion forums, or even within your friendship circles, you can escape the pressure and criticism - because why would German folks have a strong opinion on how well/poorly you’re managing XYZ Spanish team? So what if the Spanish press/social media are at my throat, if I can’t fully understand what they say or don’t even have the habit of reading through Spanish media?

Obviously Barcelona’s doing really well right now, which plays a part. But that degree of separation cannot be understated.

Also helps Spanish weather and food is really nice."
It’s been said some of it is because he doesn’t understand Spanish and hence he does not read what the media is saying about him.
I dont think i want to listen to that big man
"Bayerns goal music is actual psychological warfare

Its no wonder clubs often get spanked by 6+ goals by them, i would be so completely rattled after having to listen to that shit 3 times in one match lmao"
That’s just ptsd for Barca bros
Or just play AFTV reactions
"It's from a 19th century opera, no license needed!"
Nah play that banging Leverkusen theme. LA LA LA LA LA
"Isn't that piece of music Public Domain?


I don't think we even have to pay for it"
"I doubt it. They always have pulled this bullshit off on RMTV, it’s literally nothing new."
"Real Madrid condemns the NBA Playoffs for their unpredictability, and demand its immediate cancelation"
"The Ref for the Copa Del Rey (Spanish cup) final spoke about the harassment his fellow colleagues get on the job, especially by Madrid and their Media arm



Madrid are now throwing a temper tantrum and are threatening to boycott the final"
"man its his first season

stop talking about him leaving bruh"
He just got here bro 😭
"Everytime we visit my grandma, within the first ten minutes, she will start talking about how sad she will be when we leave tomorrow."
He’ll be like Pep. Claims he loves Bayern (same way Pep claims he loves us) yet spend majority of his career with us the same way Pep has at City. His true love is us. Just a shame Pep never had that same love. Flick will stay a long time.
Flick could have said that all referees should be stoned to death and it still wouldn’t have been as pathetic as what Real Madrid did
"""Tears always fill with such joy. Mmm. Tears. Yes. Very good."""
"This is exactly it. 

RM TV and our club leaders not only make themselves look stupid af, but naturally gives any other reasonable soul the ability to look much more intelligent. 

Its a lose lose for us "
"There was some time there mid season he was running out of patience with the refs, and I can’t blame him honestly but was shocking that it was so bad he got to the point of being all flustered."
To be fair Flick by all indications has been a lovely bloke during his Barcelona tenure. It just so happens Madrid have only heightened that.
They cancelled press conferences no?
"Carlo Ancelotti last season: ""Xavi complaining about the referees? I am a professional. I'm not going to lower myself to that level out of respect for Spanish football... Complaining about referees is a level that is not for professionals."" 

*Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has continued to claim that Los Blancos are the victims of refereeing decisions, noting that he feels that clear errors are being committed against them. The Italian manager did not dismiss the idea that La Liga is orchestrated against them.

Ancelotti was furious at the weekend after seeing his side drop points to Osasuna, and claimed that Jude Bellingham should not have been sent off for saying ‘f*** off’ after speaking to the referee, putting it down to the official’s poor command of English*"
I’m not playing any gentleman card I absolutely detest Barcelona lol. Two absolutely insufferable clubs whose fan cultures and place in the wider football zeitgeist is poisonous and the anti thesis of what makes football great. I’m just calling what I see. Flick has provided a moment of decency in contrast to Real Madrid who have not. Nothing really anything else to see here.
"Yeah, the abuse will continue until morale improves. Good luck with that."
"> Referee incompetence is something all teams should be against TOGETHER

This is not how you act to incompetence. Abuse is absolutely wrong and should be heavily penalised, especially when a club is doing what Real Madrid has, which no other club has done."
Oh stop it. even if they did that you guys would find a way to whine and blame everyone else for your failures.
"Yea it’s pathetic and embarrassing but it doesn’t compare to what Barcelona have done. 

They made hidden payments of several millions of Euros to Negreira through shell companies for “reports” that no player or coach has admitted to seeing. In fact veteran players like Pique and coaches like Valverde have even stated they didn’t know these reports existed. These are the facts. Barca fans really wanted it to be money laundering but that was ruled out already. There’s really no plausible explanation besides corruption. 

So yea Madrid are embarrassing and cry about refs. Barca actually try to influence them"
This guy talking about media power when his clubs president is fucking florentino pèrez.
"and Mbappe received an equally bad tackle vs espanyol that could have ruined mbappe's career, but that does not fit the media narrative so everyone forgets"
I think it also makes a difference when you're coaching kids vs. seasoned pros. So much of the squad is still so young. They're going to react better to someone who's more of a compassionate father figure vs. being more authoritarian. He's setting an example for them
"I completely agree with your comment, but Barca is not the biggest Spanish teams"
YABADABA DOOOOOO
Especially when you concede 2 goals in quick succession. Imagine this playing at 17’ and then at 21’. I’d be fuming

"They've never threatened to boycott a final before


This is different"
"I read that he’s not going to stay for long because he plans to retire. I think he’s going to be here for 3 years, maximum 4 if everything goes good."
"You can tell how much Flick loves the squad, he’s always running out onto the pitch to hug them after the final whistle"
">Just a shame Pep never had that same love

I believe Pep going out of the club had a lot to do with the politics inside the club, I believe Laporta being replaced by Rossel or something. Enrique left on similar circumstances. Not sure about the ground reality, but it sounds like managers get tired in time by Spanish media and club hierarchy bar Laporta who I think is a more diplomatic figure"
This whole situation reminds me of the Microsoft vs Sony presentations at E3 2013. Sony won by basically not committing ritual suicide on stage and thus were massive PR winners by default.
"Ah, I see. Though he said something contrasting Flicks' words based on that comment. Didn't realize Carlo didn't even have one. Thanks!"
Carlo probably went to buy oranges to make homemade marmalade.
But I never said Ancelotti is a gentleman did I? You wrote a whole essay about something I never said.
Not a Chelsea fan talking /s
"Flick shows decency when it suits him. Just like when Madrid complained about the schedule and they said we dont do that, we are Barcelona and less than 2 weeks later went on multiple rants about the schedule.

Just wait until a call goes against Barcelona and see his decency then."
I understand. It’s RMTVs fault. They’re not wrong about refs being shit. They’re wrong about how they’re going about saying it
"I agree. The way RMTV is going about this is entirely wrong. Like I said, this should be a joint push by all la liga (and other leagues) teams. Im not sure what RMTV expects this to solve."
is the proof in the room with us right now?
Only a select few Madrid fans are deluded enough to think the tackle Mbappe got vs Espanyol is anywhere near as bad as what he did against Alaves.
I think it’s likely from having been through some more adversity now and finding himself back at the top in another club. Mans got more perspective now than he used to
Big talk from the second biggest team in Germany after VFL Bochum
">Barca is the biggest non-fascist Spanish team

Ftfy"
Barca have more domestic cups than any other spanish side
TAN TAN TAN TAN TA TA TA TA TA TA TA!
no its just them throwing more of a tanturm
He wants to retire after this job is done but that doesnt mean he is looking to retire soon. Either way our coaches never stay that long so id also agree that 4 years is the max in a perfect world.
"Laporta also has a history with the club. And unlike other presidents he can talk the talk coz has has walked the walk.

I mean he's still the most successful president in our club's history."
"Carlo has fully backed the entire media campaign against refs from Real Madrid, which is what led to the current situation. Maybe this is a bridge too far from him and he'll say so at some point, but he's been a willing participant up until now."
"Never wrote it.
Just a simple copy + paste to disprove your nonsense."
"I can’t be bothered to give you an in depth explanation about how state owned clubs or clubs funded by wealthy owners are separately a big issue but also not a representation of the fans or the community. The fans have no control. The fans, meanwhile for clubs like Real Madrid Barcelona and juventus are openly terrible. They are pro super league, anti pyramid, anti grassroots, and don’t even travel to away games 😂. PSG, City, Chelsea whichever one of these clubs you can say what you want about their owners and where the money comes from but they are not persisting with trying to destroy local football and are no plagued in this Gen Z, NBA, CBS Golazo, CR7 vs Messi, goated/clears/cooked/aura entertainment EAFC fucking garbage."
"Again, I cannot stress to you how little I care about flick. If he does this I will also say he is indecent. I hate both these clubs equally"
The proof resulted in the indictment of the club and several executives on corruption charges
True. Can't even argue tbh
we'll take that. Friendship duo #1 and #2 as always
"I get Real is unpopular right now, but besides the Franco shit is there any reason to suggest they are fascist?"
Maybe the guy you’re replying to is a Catalan nationalist
I wouldn’t even disagree with you on this take. Idk what case that other guy is trying to argue. Throughout history and especially in the 21st century Barca have been the better team in Spanish competitions.
"Okay. Real have more league titles and much, much more CL titles than any other Spanish team. Be fr right now, there is no debate between any club and Real Madrid"
"""Toooooooor für den FC Barcelonaaaaaaaa!"""
"Oh you haven't seen nothing yet


Madrid are about to lodge a complaint against Barça and the Spanish FA at the International Criminal Court after what happened in the final


As the kids say, Generational Crashout incoming"
"Essentially a way of tech companies presenting their products for the upcoming year, similar to say when Musk introduced his cyberturd to the world"
Videogame convention.
How does that disprove my nonsense though? I said flick is not a gentleman and you replied by talking ablut Ancelotti. How does that disporve anything I said? Are you dumb?
"They’re only pro super league because it’s literally impossible to keep up with PSG and Boehley spending as a fan owned club. Real Madrid and Barcelona are literally as grassroots as it gets, owned by their supporters."
I get that. Just saying that before calling someone decent you need to see their history and Flick is decent only when it suits him.
"an indictment is not proof lol. isn’t it true that for the case to be continued, the prosecutors need to find solid proof, which they still haven’t? yeah so is this proof still in the room with us?"
"Besides being Hitler, what did Hitler do?"
">unpopular right now

Yeah, it's been too long, not just right now

And aligning your values to Franco is enough of an explanation for fascism.
Like no support for the queer community?
Having actual fascists on your board?"
Google the person who their stadium is named after and his role during the Spanish Civil War and Spanish politics in general.
"> besides the Franco shit is there any reason to suggest they are fascist?

are you aware of the name of their stadium lmao? also isn't it kind of odd how self-admitted fascists like Tebas tend to be Madrid fans? just a coincidence ig nbd."
You said spanish. So why discount copa del rey and supercopa ?
Oh so basically comic con for tech bros and uncs
"Dumb is coming up with whataboutism.
You tried to come for Xavi and Laporta's complaints and can't accept that Carlo's words aged like milk.

It's been a rough day for you.
Thoughts and prayers."
"The reason they are suffering is because they’ve turned their domestic league into a duopoly with zero jeopardy and have paid for for that in terms of
Media rights income. They’ve suppressed the smaller clubs for almost 100 years now. In the last 15-20 years once FFP came in, clubs are spending essentially what they have. English clubs are able to spend because their product is better and therefore bring in more money"
I didn’t say an indictment is proof. There was enough evidence found to indict Barca and the case is still ongoing. The hidden payments to Negreira are real. The charges are real. The prosecutors are investigating and building their case
"It's not Real's fault that they, like Barca, were favoured by Franco. They do not align themselves with him today. There isn't really anything fascist about Real to my knowing, besides the fact that a fascist at some point liked them"
Maybe the guy you’re replying to is a Catalan nationalist
"I didn't discount it. Real is just absolutely clear overall. Like there is not even a debate. The fact you're arguing this makes me believe you cannot be a real fan, because even the most diehard Barca fan wouldn't say that they are bigger than Real. No one can even remotely compare with 15 CL trophies, simple as that"
"Dude, please pick up a book and improve your critical thinking a bit. I never mentioned Ancelotti, because he also flip-flops his words. This is not the gotcha you think it is. We were talking about Flick and his hypocrisy, no one else. Did Ancelotti's words also show hypocrisy? Yes, never denied that. Just go and sleep because you are talking about something else completely."
"Ah yes, Yanited and company definitely produce a better product. Or City that got spanked by this dogshit Madrid team."
cope more lol. case isn’t going anywhere
They have the option to not name their stadium after a fascist though.
Again you’re counting ucl in domestic dominance
">We were talking about Flick and his hypocrisy, no one else.

You replied to a comment on Flick's decency by talking about Xavi and Laporta. How do their comments make Flick hypocrite? If you want to talk about Flick's hypocrisy as you claimed above, then you should bring up his comments only."
"You saying Flick is a hypocrite just shot your argument into pieces, just like the fascists' chances of winning tomorrow. 

Mommy's calling for you to get out of the basement for your lunch.
Don't choke on it 😘"
"This is exactly your problem lol. You are using champions league games to talk about the quality of your league. Thats a different competition, mate. The vast majority of football in a season is played domestically. Real Madrid can win the champions league every single year for all
I care and best every English side en route. But the premier league is jsut a better league to watch, more competitive and better spectacle on every level. Everyone loves to say “oh but city have dominated for years” well look at city before this era. Before this it was Chelsea, then united, then arsenal briefly, Liverpool in the past. Leeds Villa forest have all enjoyed periods being the dominant force. Even now, city has collapsed. The league is not perfect but there’s new storylines and narratives every few seasons. The biggest club in the country is 15th right now and the club with the best stadium is 16th. This is football. Not the same clubs doing the same thing every year. The premier league has almost become a bigger competition than the UCL because the UCL is. Same 6-8 clubs competing season in season out. 

Ps. Even if you do go European record, England has seen 7 different UCL winners while Spain has only had 2 and one of the clubs that has never even won it (Arsenal) just absolutely obliterated your best team."
No one was talking about domestic dominance. The conversation was about which team was the biggest Spanish team
"The never heard of ucl, the united champions Laliga?"
Who won the most European trophy since the 2000 tell me is Laliga. Atletico almost won it 3 time and Valencia got to 2 final.
"El Clasico is always anyone's game and the form of the season otherwise isn't usually a predictor. Anyrhing can happen. Still, I am expecting Barcelona to win."
Ferran has been doing pretty good lately. Not Lewa level but they will be fine
"Ferran should do decently with the space that Real Madrid gives away, at least in theory. Depends if Barca want more control in midfield or value counter-attack / run behind approach from start.

I prefer Olmo starting as false 9 today though, think that would work pretty well with a midfield of Pedri, de Jong and Gavi behind. Just assert complete midfield dominance early on and I think Real Madrid will crumble really quick.

Obviously you can drop Gavi and start Olmo in midfield instead. But I think that Gavi adds that little extra spice needed in these type of games that will also help to apply pressure on ball carriers to prevent Real Madrid to counter themself or punish Barca high line. So if you stop Madrid from attacking you build up team momentum, if you add midfield dominance on top of that as well you essentially looking at a 3+ goal game for Barca."
It's Mbappes match to win and Carlo last chance for trophy. I think real is gonna get out pumped like never. I expect at least a red card.
After the clownshow stunt madrid pulled yesterday i probably never wanted barca to win a game more
"Not like you need a striker to beat this Madrid, just ask Arsenal."
Ferran supremacy >>>>
Watch these rats (Real) magically win and boast about this for ages
Unfortunate 
It's fine. Lewa's finding a spot to dance...
oh seeing reports he will also miss Wednesday's UCL game.
Madrid ain't ready for the shark attack ‼️‼️‼️🦈🦈🦈
"Also Olmo is an option to play up there as a sort of false 9. It works because Lewa doesn’t really press up high, so Olmo will be in the midfield anyways"
Mbappe not fit on the bench
"Mbappe may not play and if he does, he won't be near his top level because he is injured."
"Mbappé is injured  , will Be on the bench"
"Red cards and Madrid lmao

Camavinga and Vini both should have been sent off within 60 minutes but obviously neither of them got the red."
Red card and Madrid don’t belong in the same sentence
Minor correction. The referees pulled the clown show stunt yesterday.
Excuse me we had in form top striker Mikel Merino
Hey!! Rats are cool.
"Didn't boast when we beat them 4-0 2 season ago when we had been knocked out of CL by city.

Unlike Barcelona fans who posted 4-0 to any comment Madrid fans made when the 4-0 didn't help them win the league.

That's where the meme ""Barca fans celebrate winning matches, Madrid fans celebrate winning trophies"" came from."
"Olmo's biggest strengths would be bottlenecked if there's no striker to work for. He's great at creating space for others, so he should be used to create space for a clinical striker. It's unfortunate that Lewandowski got injured just as Olmo came back from injury and they don't get to play these big matches as a duo, they're both very spatially aware and clinical players, Ferran much less so."
Ooof. Didn't know
Honestly Real Madrid will be harder to beat when you only have 1 player that isn't backtracking much. If you got 2 of them i think it would be easier for FC Barcelona to beat Real Madrid we faced the same problem 6 seasons ago.
Well that just means advantage Madrid
*checks badge* 🙄🤦‍♀️
Your brain power is dumber than club you support.
What’s it like to have everything in the world yet still play the victim?
Stop downplaying your chances. You have the must expensive squad and players in the world. Enough pretending that you're the ultimate underdogs just because Camavinga and 1-2 squad players are missing
"Oh Real is going to lose this one. Barca is in much better form than Real at the moment. 
. I have faith that the extra match Barca will have, will affect them and they lose the Liga clásico."
"Coming from a Man U supporter, that's rich."
Hey. Getting the facts straight matter
"Mate, I am not playing the underdog. We are just trash this year, no other way to spin it."
"We are shit since 2013 and we don't brag about stuff like you guys do.
.FFS can you even play a single game without being cry babies?"
So why are you working so hard to spread misinformation?
Vini+Mbappe+Rodrygo have the potential to destroy any defence in the world
"You have been trash many years. Still managed to find results out of nothing most of the time. 

Not to say you're not underdogs but it would not be terribly surprising if things went the other way."
Same comment as before.
??? The referees press conference happened buddy. I'm not making it up.
Saying reals been trash for many years is a diabolical take…
">You have been trash many years

Nope. You don't go from losing 2 games to losing 12 while playing the same football."
"the rest of teams must be utter garbage then, because RM won champions year after year"
Just for that comment I have now upgraded our chance of winning today to 1% just to spite you
The rttv video happened too? Is everyone making that up?
It's also a fact
Yes you do. Evidenced by what literally happened.
They just know how to get results despite playing like shit. Which is what I said in the comment you responded to. This is really the first season where they haven't gotten away with it in the UCL.
That's not what was unprecedented.
How does a trash team go about winning 2 CLs and 3 league titles in the last 5 years? I don’t even like real but what you’re saying is fucking brain dead
And that is you opinion 
"Nope. You can't watch us last year and then watch us this year and think ""Same shit"". Not a chance lmao."
"lmao, you must be 12 if you think you can win the champions year after year ""out of nothing"""
"The referee press conference is not unprecedented, they do that for CDR. What’s unprecedented is Real being called out on your bullshit. Self awareness is not your forte, Real is one of the clubs most benefitted by refereeing “mistakes”."
You can win while playing like shit. Happens all the time.
Only difference is Vini was good last season and bad this season.
If that's what you wanna believe. Sure.
It's unprecedented. It has never happened before. Show me one referee press conference before an important match. I'll wait.
"And that Kroos was here

And that we had full backs

And we actually played football

And that Carlo didn't lose the dressing room

And that this year we gave up the perfectly functional 442 to accommodate Rodrygo

And literally everything else that happened"

"Wasn't a pen, good save!"
Karma. Clear dive. Kicks his leg out before any contact happens to go down.
"Vardy kicks Sa and gets a penalty.

Justice done"
Was never a penalty. Get fucked for diving.
"Horribly taken

I think Vardy gets in his own head too much when he's in a rut and ends up overthinking things"
"Crazy that VAR thought it was fine, blatant dive"
Jose Sa gives no fucks about your club records
"Love to see it. A Jamie Vardy special that, kicks the keeper to manufacture the contact. Never a penalty."
How the fuck is that a penalty in the first place? Fuck off you steptoe looking cunt
"Good, never a penalty."
PGMOL just ruined the idea of VAR. Hope they will change their mind before the next season but... I've lost it completely
"Never a pen, good for my FPL team"
"Never a pen. Vardy takes a heavy touch and can’t score so he kicks his right leg out at Sa, initiating the contact."
"Vardy moving the opposite direction of the ball to stomp on Sa. How VAR cleared this I'll never know. (We do know, VAR is shit)"
Ball dont lie
Ball don't lie
Ball was gone AND he kicked Sa
How has var even given that.
Softest pen call I’ve seen in a while 
Get fucked vardy you cunt
Dirty Vardy
Ball don't lie
Obscene that VAR doesn’t call the ref to the monitor
One of the replays clearly showed Vardy kicking his leg out. ridiculous
And forwards do this *so* often in this position
"He doesn't just kick his leg out, he stamps on the inside of Sa's thigh while running at speed. Could have been a nasty injury that."
"He does kick a leg out but Jose Sa path and momentum still makes him collide with the player.  Both things can be true, obviously looking for the contact, but Sa gave it to him .."
Nah I got him and Ait-Nouri in FPL
"Saw it was wolves, var turned off his monitor"
The Wayne Rooney against Arsenal special
"City won a pen against us where Gundogan moved his leg out slightly towards Hojberg who was running alongside him, treads on Hojberg's ankle which causes Hojberg to fall and then bring Gundogan down at the same time. Sometimes VAR will take forever looking at some incidents and not enough time on others.

Think this was the same game as the infamous clip of Mourinho and his assistant running up to the 4th official!"
"Nah. If you look at the second replay (which at this point is perpendicular with Vardy's direction of travel) you can clearly see that [he was going to pass Sa](https://imgur.com/a/V4wp8b3), and that he [kicks his leg out to draw contact](https://imgur.com/a/zUtl8En)."
"You don't have to go that far back to link it to Arsenal, Havertz did it last year against Bournemouth to win a pen. Saka tried it against Bayern as well but luckily the ref saw through it."
"The main point is that it was the penalty that ended the 49 unbeaten streak.

Obviously there's other instances (like Vardy many times in the title winning campaign) but the Rooney one was one of the biggest singular instances for it."

What a strike!
What a fucking hit
Need Charlton to mount a comeback for an exciting final day.
"Vielen dank, Frankfurt. 


The Frankfurt we saw today was reminiscent of the one previously when Marmoush was still there. The Frankfurt I had as a favorite vs Spurs.

Incredibly lethal while also compact. Midfield dominance too."
"It's been a great Saturday for me and this is a huge cherry on top!


What a fucking game, lads! Hoping to close the season on a high!"
"Win against a direct competitor for CL spot, valuable points to keep ahead of the other chasing pack too!


Sad we couldn't bring out this game against Tottenham. "
Frankfurt in the CL will be pretty cool ngl
Wow Wahi is bad.
I enjoyed this game a lot.
"Was in the absolute shit at work when this game was going on and couldn’t watch, was feeling a bit stressed about it. Imagine my jubilation when I checked the final score. Auf gehts in die CL jungs!"
"Thanks Frankfurt very cool. It's actually in our hands to play internationally now.


If we win all 4 Games we are guaranteed conference league (since we play the cans).
Still a tough ask but at least nobody to blame but ourselves."
He does feel like he's a bit slow with his decision-making. More reactionairy than proactive
Just like Ekitike last season. Let Dino cook.
"Brother, Heki looked so much better than this. People saying this clearly don't remember how much work he was putting in, even if he wasn't getting the goals and assists."
dang what happened to Clermont
"Thanks to Pau beating Metz, Lorient is now promoted and we have never been closer to a Paris derby next season with PFC just needing one win against Martigues or Ajaccio to be promoted (even if Metz wins all their remaining games)"
Fuck this :(
Classic case of a club overperforming and think they had arrived. Their squad was good and their ride the wave into a midtable finish but Clermont is more a midtable Ligue 2 club than a Ligue 1 club.

Make up call from one of the worst refs this season
The ref has completely lost control of that game
What a terrible penalty call by the ref.
"If that is a pen, then every corner should have one"
Have no idea how that’s “clear and obvious”
"Refereeing standards in this country are so, so poor.

That’s “clear and obvious”? He’s barely touched him lol"
"Incredibly soft pen but after robbing our perfectly good goal earlier that's back equal. 


Absolutely horrendous refereeing. "
"Ref has lost this game completely, should have given the goal when the keeper walked into Bruno. Cards for nothing then not giving the easiest calls of his life."
Dreadful decision
The standard of refereeing in this country is garbage. I expect this to be given every game from now on.
the referees were better in the championship
"that wasn't a pen, gotta be a make up for the perfectly fine goal bruno got disallowed earlier

Two bad decisions cancel each other out?"
A guy gets tripped and it’s simulation but a guy feels a brush on his arm and drops down for a pen. Whatever.
How is that a pen??!
"Not a penalty for me that, not really sure what exactly VAR was getting involved in the first place never mind awarding it. Makes up for Brunos goal though"
Two wrongs make a right?
Never a pen but after the robbery with the disallowed goal I'll take it
Another ridiculous decision
"If you’re going to send them to the monitor, show the play in regular speed. It’s so stupid to constantly show slow mo"
"Shit way to score, we deserve to be up but Christ we gotta get our shit together"
How the fuck is that a pen
Ref has decided this game
Soft pen for a soft disallowed goal
There it is!!!!
Fucking disgraceful dive
Lmao bro got a pen for a pat on the back. Gerrarahere
How much help does Newcastle need from the refs?
I’m sorry but that’s a joke
yeah ref aint it man altho the game became even more entertaining after the red
The ref has been absolutely shocking this game. In both teams regards
"Shouldn't have been overturned.

Feels like the ref knows he robbed us of a goal so once VAR told him to look, he went with it to give us the chance."
Game's gone
If you're going to disallow Bruno's goal for something as soft as standing still it's only fair you give a penalty for something as soft as a slight tug on Murphy's arm.
The Bruno goal should have stood. Ben shouldn’t have received the first yellow. And the pen was 50-50.
"Remember Everton had a 5 minute VAR decision to overturn a penalty that had more contact that this :)))))

VAR implementation is literally a joke"
Maybe if Ipswich played football instead of rugby they would’ve stayed up this season. They had it coming.
"I have no love for either team here, but absolutely shameful to award that. Should be a yellow for simulation.

""Game's gone"" and all of that but this is infuriating."
EPL corruption on full display.
Tc'ed isak but that is such an egregious pen lmfao. Like I'm happy and fuming
He's got everything wrong except the 2nd yellow imo
Absolute bonkers decisions across the board. It's mind boggling how bad he's been.
Well there's been about 6 stoppages and he's only given 1 minute. Crazy.
"Yep, utter inconsistency.  I’d be fine with them actually calling holds more, but they have to do it consistently and stick with it so that defenders change their play style.  Right now some of this is just Russian roulette or gambling the ref and VAR just decide not to call it."
"Same with the goal we should have got for the Bruno ""foul"", the referee has been utter, utter dogshit."
Go back to your own league then if it's so much better there! Smh. Taking up a spot in my league when I can't even get a house that doesn't leak.
Agreed. Games gone
"Johnson dived bruh come on please do better.

Ref has been dogshit tho"
Only one of those involved physical contact
Idk I think the first yellow for the guy who got sent off makes up for it
"We've been battering them? Multiple off the line clearances and the bar being hit, and a fine goal being disallowed. 

Some people aren't happy unless we're putting 10 past every low block we meet ffs."
"Course he hasn't, if you were actually watching the game."
"Ironically 2 wrongs made a right, I didn't agree with either of the major decisions from the ref but it should be 1-0"
Ref wrongly disallowed a Newcastle goal in this game.
What game have you been watching?
"Dunno, depends on how many times the opponent wants to assist."
Mad how they disallowed an obvious goal if they're trying to help us
I mean Ipswitch should have been 9 men
A valid and fair goal was disallowed you clown.
You taking the piss? Their keeper walked into Bruno and gave away a goal and they got it chalked off?
it's still less than the help Liverpool has got this season.
Clearly not been watching the game.
You have awoken the horde
Bro rattled a whole fanbase
Explain how Bruno’s goal was disallowed then.
We tried playing football earlier in the season and that didn’t work either
"It's just incompetence, he disallowed a goal for us for nothing. He's completely lost control of the game"
Pretty much
"Tbf, I captained Isak so given Newcastle deserved to score one goal, I’d rather it be an Isak pen than the first one"
"When did it get so bad?  
You can't even remember a matchday without some ref fuckin up. And usually it's multiple instances."
"Sir, without these shitters we get relegated this season"
He absolutely didn’t dive
"It wasn't a dive. He fell because of contact. That doesn't make it a foul either, but players will embellish.

The correct action there would've been to play on, no harm no foul."
He's disguising well in that case
He disallowed a perfectly fine Newcastle goal and didn't hand Morsey a red card...
"hes not, he's just terrible"
"Against who?

He literally robbed Newcastle of a goal."
Biased? He disallowed a goal for someone standing still... Incompetent sure
Shouldn't have dived then should he
I don’t think he’s been against us. He has been shit though.
We literally had a legal goal disallowed. A soft card and a soft pen just level the bad refereeing.
"I mean, a person obviously not watching the game making a vacuous comment is always going to annoy people."
I mean when the ref disallows a clear goal everyone says should be a goal and you say that ref is bias towards the side whose goal he disallowed people are gonna think you’re clueless.
Fair enough
Seriously. And VAR is somehow making it worse. It's really a shame because all we want is a fair match as fans (and I'm sure as players too).
Fair enough. Someone has to put the fries in the bag. But they should learn our values. We don't do good officiating here.
So was he pre-falling or has Burn a force field?
"The view from the far side show it is clearly a dive.  He runs through whatever minimal contact there is without issue, then drags his foot and goes down. "
100% biased... against foootball
"Dive good when work for me, dive bad when other team"
Well I mean you were rewarded for a dive
Imagine having the confidence to talk like this while in 15th.
He's avoided Burn's leg because he's going to get clattered.  Not a dive.
It wasn't a dive. Whys he putting his arm on him anyway? To prevent him from running through and taking a shot/making a pass. In such a great position too. Absolute pen.
"Pssssh... it was a joke making fun of a certain group of people. I know Reddit is slow with that stuff sometimes, but lighten up!"
Avoided? He practically runs into Burn and falls over begging for the foul. If that’s not simulation then nothing is. Running into a player isn’t a foul on them. Even though the keeper convinced the ref it was earlier.
"Amazing how no one gets this when they see it slowed down or they haven't played football for the last 10 years of their life.

Of course you're gonna jump out of the way of a defender going to clatter you, anticipating contact and getting out of the way isn't always diving. There is a middle ground between diving and a foul, and that was it."
Do you genuinely believe that slight tug of the arm is enough for him to go down?
"It was funny don’t worry about it babe, Reddit has the worst sense of humour."
"If you want cards for making the most of contact then every match will end with eight a side.

I thought he was primarily interested in self-preservation."
"I believe it's a foul, and if he doesn't go down it doesn't get called. The contact is enough to stop Murphy from getting to that ball where he could have made something happen. And there was absolutely no need to put hands on him"
I can see your perspective. I can see how the ref felt it was simulation. I think we’ve had much worse calls this match then it though. Ref is playing with a different set of rules than I’m familiar with.
"Fair enough, I do not believe that’s a foul, I think it’s very soft and definitely nowhere near a clear and obvious error, I also think if he doesn’t jump on the floor he actually can still make it to the ball"

I hope he succeeds. Watching Ghana vs Uruguay at the World Cup is one of my earliest football memories.

Also I'd say that not *too* many know that André and Jordan Ayew are his sons.

"Porto are in the mud, aren't they? What's going on with them?"
Genuinely cannot believe this was given as a penalty. Contact sport my arse.
A bunch of things. They sold their two best players in January and didn't get replacements. New coach is playing a system that he doesn't have the players for. Players having partys until 4am. Terrible squad and football that can't create chances if wonderkid Mora isn't inspired.
Adding to the other comment: they're also 500M in debt
"Mediocre squad and bad coach....





(and, most importantly, no criminals in the stands threatning the ref and Pinto da Costa died)"
"Ah, I see. The players mentality needs changing. Is Taremi still there?"
There is virtually zero contact. If you think this is a foul. You're part of the problem.
Yeah a lot of players are playing like they don't care what happens. Taremi left last year and joined Inter on free.
"A still from the video shared here: https://i.imgur.com/TMx2rp5.png

Does that look like zero contact to you?"
"Yes. I seen the penalty, I seen the VAR. I was watching live. The leg literally stops there. There is no more follow through. This is genuinely the softest penalty I've seen in years"
"Not only the keeper's leg continues to ""compress"" as he moves towards the player, but when the player jumps, the keeper's left leg extends again (as the keeper continues his slide)... this shows that there was pressure on the leg and the screenshot clearly shows the studs hitting the leg of the opponent. It makes no sense to say that there was ""virtually zero contact"".

Now, maybe you think that we should allow these tackles... that's a valid position to have. But for that we need to change the rules/guidance... as it is, referees give fouls for similar tackles all the time and yet you're acting like this was the most ridiculous foul/penalty ever given. Exaggeration.

But moving on."

And no, I'm not talking about Wolves"
"I love this kid 🐺
He's going to be special"
Rodrigo Gomes always looks like he's just happy to be included.
Rodrigo Gomes - 2 in 2 against Leicester
"I never want to see Ruud again, the most dogshit manager I've seen in my lifetime"
Hot take Leicester maybe arent a good team
Leicester are dog shit
Cunha is dominating
Ruud Van Nistelrooy is comfortably the worst Prem manager of all time
Great finish
The foxes really are shit
Why are we playing Faes 😭
"PSV fans warned plenty of people. I love Ruud, but as a manager, he's not it."
If that was any of our forwards bar Amad (and maybe Zirkzee) the ball goes into row Z
To be fair he is also managing one of the worst Prem teams of all time
"Frank De Boer. Ruud has a dogshit squad, but Frank De Boer was really really bad."
did you start watching this year?
Leicester are dire. Even Hojlund scored against them
is that really that an unreasonable shout? he’s absolutely up there
"He is the only manager in the history of the top four English leagues to have his team lose 8 consecutive home games without scoring a single goal.

He took over a team with 10 points from 13 games, and has managed 8 points from 21 games himself.

It's one of the worst managerial records you'll ever see, I'm not really sure how you can say this is a recency bias thing, it's a completely reasonable shout."
"Nope, but this season has featured two of the worst managers to ever grace the league."
it's not that absurd to say that he is one of worst manager of all time...
"He'll be in the top 10 by the end of the season on a PPG basis

Could someone DocuSign to me the Smith Rowe apology form?
Great first touch
"Criminal amount of time and space to leave someone in in the penalty area.

Think that was our first shot on target."
6 goals for how bad he's been is very good
First shot on target. 1-1 big deflection but Saints not been at it 2nd half
He is alive
Just walked up half the field there
First touch has arsenal dna all over it
That lofted ball was so slow… there’s no way he should have ever been able to bring that down in a premier league game.
Injuries have totally ruined him. I hope that he gets injury free pre season and can finally achieve his potential next season.
"That's been the story of their entire season from what I've seen, just cannot see a game out to save their lives."
"We hope too but even when he has an injury free run and gets rested he comes on the 65th min looking like he's play 200mins in a row. Fitness, intensity and pressing are all awful."

Walsall were running away with the league. They've just had an FM loss of form.
All in poor form lol
"Walsall are winless for the last 12 matches. 

It is insane they still have a shot for direct promotion. 

It is also insane they had such a huge lead that they just needed to win 1 or 2 matches of their last 2 to secure promotion and managed to not even do this very basic performance!"
0 wins in 12.
It was Nathan Lowe's recall to Stoke which did it. He was recalled and sits on the bench.
Ouch. The fact that they're still only a point off 3rd is miraculous.
"Before this run: 67 points, 33 games → 2.03 PPG

After this run: 74 points, 45 games → 1.64 PPG

Getting 7 points out of 36 is horrid"

LACA !! My king !
Can't even win against Lyon anymore. The state of this club
Siuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
"The generaaaaal ! Only one more left for the 200 goals with us. 

That's a nice answer to what happened last week."
Eh Lyon were probably gonna beat you anyway
"I don't think Lyon fans were as confident as you. We've somehow always had their number. We've been pretty much stomping them lately even when out of form, and when Lyon was at their peak in the 2000s we still often were their boogeyman"
Rennes is one of our worst opponent at home (they won 6 out of the 9 last OL-SRFC)
Lille has been the real boogeyman all along
"Very true. Crazy to see the difference between this match vs Saint Étienne last week. 
2 different teams on the pitch and Rennes is a much better team qualitatively"

3 goals in 4 minutes.  Mourinho mentality.
Even Fred scored
"I assume ""ultras"" means Boixos Nois are reminding people once again why Laporta banned their asses from Camp Nou - they resurface only for away games."
"Seems like the Boxios nois are the ultras group identified in the videos here, they've been long since banned from Barcelona. Their usual clownery on scene here"
why are we trying to outclown RM here?
">More than a dozen officers have confronted fans who were wreaking havoc in the area. The ultras have responded with a defiant attitude as police drove forward, even throwing bottles of glass and throwing rent motorcycles to the ground

>

>This is not the first incident of the day. Agents of the National Police arrested this morning a fan of the culé who, they say, allegedly assaulted a Real Madrid fan next to Plaza de la Campana.

>

>Faced with the riots that these types of events usually bring with them, the president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation Rafael Louzán has conveyed his gratitude and that of the federal body to the members of the National Police Corps.  


>""Normally nothing ever happens in a sporting event of this kind, but so that nothing happens there are 1,400 people from the National Police and 800 more private security professionals working so that we can all enjoy this show,"" he added."
Barcelona has ultras? Lmao.
"Boixos nois keeps fucking us over, their clownery doesn't represent us and they keep doing borderline heinous stuff in our name"
Boixos Nois are manifesting a generational Mufa
And you're both losing. A terrible advertisement for Spanish football.
u believe media lol
"They are ""unofficial"" Ultras. They are banned from the stadium for several offences, including several incidents of violence. They are your average group of far-right nutbags."
"And somehow in almost every conversation about atmosphere you'll find that one idiot whining about how ""we need ultras back"" (and they don't mean Grada d'Animació)."
Knowing what Boixos Nois do this isn’t media propaganda…
Always cracks me up when non-White foreign fans on Twitter complain about the exclusion of Boixos Nois
"The difficult thing is knowing what Boixos actually do due to Catalan media. 

Just a few weeks ago there was a reference of when they murdered a transgender woman in the '90s and it was written up as if it wasn't them. And I mean, she even has the square where it happened named after her, it's no secret. In the '90s it was the same, that got reported as ""football ultras""."

Here's hoping they crush Elversberg
"Should they win against Elversberg, they will be very motivated against you one week later."
"Yes, but as long as Dusseldorf do not win today two more wins (most likely against Hannover and Regensburg) should secure us an automatic promotion spot."
What team is that in your flair?
TuS Koblenz
How did I forget... I hope you guys get promoted soon

"I live in the Ruhrgebiet now, even been to a few games for the likes of Oberhausen and MSV Duisburg, and had no idea that the Regionalliga West has has so many troubles recently. It's a very interesting read."
"This will be happening all over European football soon. I can certainly see a league 1 or 2 club going under in England in the next 5 years. Players wages and stadium upkeep costs are just going up and up, but you can’t charge the fans much more as our wages haven’t been increasing. Tickets are already expensive, it can cost £50 a ticket for me to see my team in the championship, it’s a lot of money to do it every week, when you have kids etc. 

There’s so much money in football in England, but a lot of it is right at the top. It isn’t filtering down at all, it’s just lining pockets. Over £60mil was spent on agency fees in the championship last year, over £400mil in the premiership. That’s enough money to probably keep the whole of league 1 payed for. Instead, it’s lining a pocket of someone that is likely already rich and likely outside of the U.K."
"Thank you, very well written"
"This is such a good resume of capitalism. Billionaire clubs at the top, and clubs bankrupting 3 tiers lower.  
It would be so easy to divert some of these resources to the lower leagues, not even to level the playing field, not even to recognize the contribution of lower leagues clubs to the general healthiness of football (and, among other things, the production of U15 talents for professional academies), but only to make it manageable for lower tier clubs to even survive a lower tier season.  
But even that is apparently too much to ask, so welp !

What is described in this article has been true for decades for french clubs as well, especially in the 3rd tier (""National""). The commonplace saying about french National is that you have two seasons to either promote to Ligue 2 or get relegated before you go bankrupt, else it becomes financially unbearable. And that should be a major issue, should've been for years.

Edit : oh and thanks for the translation by the way, much appreciated"
"Uerdingen supporter here. Very good sum up of this whole shenanigans. My club is the definition of chaos, and I cannot stand it any longer.

Just two updates:

1. The WDFV already said there will be no appeal since the administrator now has the final word, not the board anymore, and this decision is final.

2. Düren did withdraw already the license application for next year and is therefore the third team that gets relegated. If no Western team gets relegated from the 3rd league, all relegated teams in the Regionalliga West had to withdraw at some point."
"I think people tend to just propose or demand solutions to things that have no simple fix. 

The reality of a 3. Liga team is that if they get promoted their TV money share jumps from a bit over €1m to at least like €7m and if they get relegated they have to tour the periphery instead of playing in front of 10s of thousands and they get no TV money at all. 

The threshold from amateur football to professional football and from one consolidated league to four regional leagues is bound to be a headache. Sure, the authorities should weed out clubs like Türkspor or Uerdingen beforehand, but other than that I don't see much to be done, aside from forcing clubs take reign in their wage bills. But then you'd probably end up with a new set of complaints."
