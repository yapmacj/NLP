chelsea fan
happens clasico final biggest game club football metric innit
greatest football game season though across competition
youtube short as comment
madrid annoying decade youd recent football fan think caused recency bias
dont know people always think context time matter he running slap garcia slightly always foul suck attacking player youre moving arm naturally foul
always given foul get frustrating ridiculus call
endrick fully kicked someone ball got away nothing happen
suggestion doesnt need improving sure team 20 point ahead 17th win playoff secure place
think issue typical club would end relegation battle bit well run fulham brentford brighton forest even villa u compared 1015 year ago mean need real basket case like everton point deduction field issue really get dragged even stayed fairly comfortably end last year
throw 15th18th playoff championship 3rd6th 2 come others go
fought season position still end theyre shit hell
unpopular opinion make league 18 team
madrid lose one final lot start reciting poetry
okay
weird man united screwing u usually tale old time
thats pretty crazy club manage
honestly whole lot better efl there really two slot game saturday afternoon tuesday night theyre shy giving team massive trip tuesday night
desperately hope palaceforest final would refreshing
mental madrid greatest club world actually built team unlikeable twat moment time actually aint good either madrid really need rebuild
club adores juanito pepe exactly pariah either many madrid fan hell forgiven
know people know ball already hated season seemed widened scope hatred massively
yeah im glad scored early really nervy game didnt really turn impressed
shouldnt get fuck another league good youre concept promotion relegation general
simping madrid crazy yes biggest club world also entitled cunt find respect anyone want play look bellingham seemed like nice kid borussia complete bellend
oh yeah course lower league football littered charlatan criminal leech owner im trying paint club paragon virtue compared wicked wrexham token though plenty club dont shady tie even fan owned one
yeah issue private ownership wrexham leveraging financial power lure player multiple division level good lower level might destroying game know werent helping dont actually specific issue club people run emblematic issue english game praised feel good story mean youre fan one successful club swedish history elfsborg arent exactly minnow domestic game even arent successful malmo youve played nearly many game european competition team played top flight 121 year history dont exactly perspective club spend existence lower league
prefer entertainment pitch also dont mind headloss social medium work lot grassroot football good luck trying persuade kidteen become ref amount shit slinging theyve seen past 24 hour
apart incident cross line like rüdiger one dont actually mind toxicity heatred showing fight example dont think vini anything particularly wrong yesterday antic wise yet still getting hate match problem play shit cant back lose game make sure win game amp heat yesterday raphinhas lamines dive would gotten attention
know particularly like say barça fan overhype player ever considered accepting fact player good kounde pedri best itw position rn doubt
yeah went ben white way
nobody who actually involved wrexham club treat underdog story medium rival fan stupid get mad something outsider say
consolation theyre almost certainly going get battered championship theyre squad relatively old far richer club championship wrexham
surely exposure less value farther ladder go like youre going get player would normally ask 100kwk wage retweeting protein shake
worst thing arda turan fair
valverde
potter wank tho benefitted massively club like brighton gone two bigger club demanding fanbases he handled theyre brilliantly run club brighton id trade place instant perform there pressure inside outside club work teething problem fanfare
league form style football became dire fair still finished 9th form back half season piss poor squad woeful considering rebuilt entire team summer moyes done previously im surprised didnt give chance right ship new lad
much liverpool mortgage
first time im glad scoutrelated activity curse always lose badly cant watch game scout stuff
yeah liverpool much team win game 31 conceding first also spur go 01 half time get wrecked second half
well record bottom 3 relatively awful probably benefit included
play neutral venue distribute matchday ticket fairly
played 440 minute total mean fuck
whats point ucl didnt play single minute
played minute cl much contribution
probably wouldve given chance play barcelona though
dont think meant trophy cabinet would 100 playtime fact doubt barca buy olmo gotten guler
man would liked game bernabeu instead imagine winning league dodgy penalty winning copa del rey 2 week would fucking history book
used play u lot shame he become
mean alright southend 30 wealdstone
sometimes given game football better
team 20 point ahead 17th exaggeration make suggestion seem silly thats almost never case time lot closer 17th 18th give 17th even safe dropping 18th near end season something play escape play getting 16th give 1820th something play close promixity could sneak 18th instead laying accepting relegation saying best idea world bad make 3rd championship pay 6th play either could easily 20 point well
logic apply championship playoff sheffield 22 point ahead 5th 23 point ahead 6th7th
could make like serie b third place get promoted instead going play there x amount point 3 4
would entertaining could make point efl playoff everyone love idea give many team something play instead half game easter mattering
remember cheated repeatedly stay
terrible idea premier league side would win often
would french german dont feel inferior
madrid got pumped hard bro got lost cosmos
lot dont dont high expense since club either amateur semi professional relies lot outside support
got keep eye see unlucky lot given gateshead away sat followed trip truro tuesday
start board ancelotti enabled way beyond player club distancing next generation talent grow real pathetic whiny club
madrid greatest club world actually built team unlikeable twat big precicely player like
think he wrexham welsh
ah understand ambiguity meant league system rather league
jude bellingham acted exact dortmund actually kind annoying people think he changed difference played underdog sort dortmund entitled club world
whole bild piece jude dortmund playersstaff thought bad influence team glad left always like real enable behaviour
also entitled cunt find feel like say basically every big club
isnt good lower league sound like issue hierarchy existing general football privately fan owned club would solve issue club attractive play club dont exactly perspective club spend existence lower league yes perspective relative league europe better played tottenham europa league squad vast majority player came youth academy city thats less half size hull reward got one best player team got bought plymouth relegated league 1 worst team championship offer 10 time higher wage dont think issue need solved think perfectly normal part football
hard take opinion granted every pedri there also calling someone like fermin new busquets one decent game
something fist something longterm twerking barca
actually get brighton fan hate potter allowed two season pretty bad result boring football thing started get good fucked chelsea also history lesson comment condescending
still mean lose
club would still lose money season ticket get devalued since dont cover european night general sense club package cupeuropean tie isnt unheard raising ticket price cover loss matchday revenue would exploitative mention scalper getting uefa subsidise difference isnt happening also asking fan go bucharest istanbul shortnotice planehotel ticket spike roof soon fixture get announce would shit time one match normality take quick drive old traffordsan siro enjoy game work
carlos forever right
arent real thing
watch u lose gateshead
regardless think rule timing game 0 impact foul
sorry 15 point 4 game gap widen close enough already there reason playoff id rather final day drama pointless change
give 17th even safe dropping 18th near end season something play escape play getting 16th give 1820th something play close promixity could sneak 18th instead laying accepting relegation see vision think people resistant hate change would grow love see huge increase drama
logic absolutely apply tradition guess make bit sense 24 team give team something play
play offs work enough team logical way system like would work would 3rd x point ahead 4th get automatic promotion otherwise seems needlessly convoluted main point system work fine dont really need fixing
dont like could encourage team throwing match force playoff seventh playing team fourth itd best interest lose close gap
seems needlessly complicated something work fine opinion
3 team relegated week advance relatively new thing dont need change system 3 really shit team come last two year one shit team doesnt deserve stay fluked playoff game 17th
fuck think
agree completely
mean welsh team playing england thats happened wrexham 100 year old welsh league formed similar story welsh club pyramid
shouldnt taken seriously way appreciating player appreciation stay long time must good
aint getting barca olmo pedri
less match mean player better rested therefore play better important match instead getting tired injured useless cup match
hope dont want fucker anywhere near brazil nt
oh yeah written star doomed stay league forever
yes rewarding pathetic dive like eric garcias great game thats people want watch
thought championship play offs gotcha way want know similarity difference reasoning
yeah thats mean let real welsh team play welsh league

good player shitty mental take
among top 2 hardworking player club besides valverde instance outlier rule
go fotmob compare midfielders defensive work bellingham youll see among top player defensive work tooand yes even better pedri stat isolating one incident making statement like exactly hate clipwatcher football
main problem he among worst dealing player running look defensive back theyre different build mean he faced top player kept quiet playing game gutted leaf
cu cu cubarsi

mbappe ly good attacking player yesterday whole season lol
hope get manager make complete player one completetop player around talking attitude caused problem like diving pretty standard argument ref attitude barely negative effect playstyle running as whole season despite playing euro summer carrying shoulder injury since 2023
28th minute youre already exhausted point there issue talk
dare let get way mentality entitled

old psg

unc must run youngster ffs
fede looking like cheat code extra time man still able sprint everywhere 100 minute crazy engine
alonso get flayed madrid fan spoil legacy madrid history treating ex galacticos poorly remember casillas exit zidane aura made big ego respect unconditionally alonso legend zidane level super galactico aura zidane going rebuild phase madrid thing going get ugly
would awful move xabi dressing room many toxic ego dont quality back club isnt good place want madrid job wait sort thing could get ugly quickly madrid fan wont back calling head november result arent good enough stay leverkusen he 43 plenty time take madrid job later

get battered everywhereeeee go
im still traumatized disasterclass put v vini still girona one worst performance seen
uruguayan
haha good save
man valverde 3 set lung man everywhere today
why final pathetic
yes thats legitimate criticism personally cant stand artificial show he trying make field time another clear instance great player way much showman much love compare valverde youre never seen valverde putting show make level classy bellingham imo
he good defensive 10 8 6
yeah he great madrid since arrival couple brainfarts em go unnoticed cuz keep winning
save outlier game castellon cup final
maybe im wrong arent stats fotmob comparison attacking midfielders including cm dm
sometimes happened thats far big problem often he
presence player make teammate worse look ronaldo united return scored way less goal compared previous season joined despite decent number thats literally happened madrid
running as whole season seen two game year neither match arsenal run as
happen latinoamerica would culones
generally good everything pretty bland field
rocket league
hilarious part
barcelona legend pedro still playing 2025
taa never done blatantly lol
sadly true
kid yamal tracking back like idiot including stripping vini ball time
might still top 10 include keeper well
time together psg messi pressing mbappe
arguing completely livid keep shouting ref get ball front less accident cunt away clearly lash ball anger top corner 25 yard brilliant he even celebrating world class goal afterwards still mad httpsyoutubepphqrpj7tlysiw_7av39zofetls
reminds berbatov nani goal
thought let world class midfielder stroll past ball lost
new psg becoming like old madrid fascinating see
psg porn street gay
correlation imply causation
fuck mbappe think team hasnt always way
hey dont drag u single child
lol best player last night
would thought insert shocked pikachu
bellend like since dortmund insufferable
rüdiger chill guy kroos left carvajal militao mendy due injury vini rodrygo form kylian change balance madrid would look way different would proper back four creativity calmness midfield
old aged messi tracking back psg mbappe
thats gon na leave big hole midfield team decent midfield winger feast
hope doesnt join fede track back inverts midfield
even liverpool less ibou baller cover past watch every time trent get attacked hendo every time nowadays szobo might track back ibou usually cover
bad occasionally game look solid outlier norm im saying someone watch almost every liverpool game he bad bradley much better defensively even mention gomez
2 defendee stud amazing cover 3 people time
need pass good clean sheet harder come
liverpool fan bitter lol
trent probably watching video thinking hell fit right attempting long ambitious ball tracking back dna
sub reactionary career suicide exaggeration real madrid werent current cl champion
say like clown show ego havent constant madrid cl dominance
jfc one bad season doom gloom madrid worse season back 20182019 season 68 point less 18 ppg survived 2 cl since
astonishing level talent yet cant disagree rebuild phase
gerard pique world class cb right plus ex instead schwein
guess work better pressure something along line
yeah mom brazilian brazilian law really easy get citizenship
point much ego track back ego isnt issue tracking back quite lot
yes thats mentioned compare pedris defensive work
idk manchester united shit general one always saved
team doesnt become worse alltime goalscorer striker also saved many match player season ive never seen player performing blamed underperformance team first time ive seen ronaldo reminds espn headline something along line ronaldos goal actually problem united peak football analysis preliminary yeah know ronaldo suck confidence everyone around make worse player make tactical excellence impossible coach silly take villain power exudes feed weakness others caused first place ole gunnar come tactic including one best best goalscorers history thats ronaldos fault eth also inadequate coach manage coach outside one trick pony one dimensional idealistic tactic ronaldo villain
6 goal serie year still
transfer 1 pedro 5 pedros take place
tbf pedro real name
indeed 6 league goal lazio seasono
yamal crazy work ethic 17 man kid play 90 minute every game cant rested time dont many backup winger
brexit goal ever saw one
here higherquality video although think viewable uk ireland thanks sky sport _ httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsrtvqzfzsjq
thats crazy lot sport lose super star like youre toast guess addition subtraction mbappé cancer dont follow football like
could mbappé touch thing
mbappe effect
oh implies doesnt prove implication
funny see bellingham vini jr watch pedri take space midfield score somehow people blame mbappe lol
maybe arrival completely threw balance team league cl last year without looked absolutely invincible opposition faced arrival reason indirect frustration complaining youre seeing player carried madrid success last year
past able pull together mattered winning core gone left accessory
really liverpool managed rm manage
yeh liverpool pl twice champ league another 2 final fa cup league cup club world cup super cup lot decent team feasting
hey know team
current cl champion humiliated arsenal longer
depends who gon na replace ancelotti cause many coach manage big ego like atleast xabi alonso might able leaf leverkusen maybe raul new zidane klopp might work season 2 max dont see madrid starlet buying hard work counter pressing constant running longer wouldnt surprised dressing room implodes somewhen 2nd year making klopp leave forcing perez call zidane help save season
career suicide completely nonsense phrase even mean maybe make sense someone playing championship push move hoping get picked epl team end playing rest career league ml whatever even trent alexanderarnold end playing real madrid banter era team he still going earning ridiculous amount money top flight team someone take career suicide mean something like destroys reputation leaving liverpool anyone going taa least everyones decided leg gone he never going seen player ever thats something think he already made peace nature reinterpretation change rm enter banter era english press attribute rms banterness taas inability defend existing narrative
mean sense hell add liability press defense decides go hell probably one first one replaced pitch start collapsing defensively
tbh dont pay much attention madrid outside game champion league
lol u right next time
he uruguayan brazilian
didnt know
yeah bro maybe forgot instead
thats thing though team may needed saving wasnt field could probably played team ball game outright looking madrid thing literally forward worse stats last season lost two game seasonboth atl
football team game youve actually played ball level youd know possible great player presence affect rest teammate example vini went someone worked hard pressed least average level basically anymore think happened focal point middle cross instead player share space field
really reminds messis frantic pressing still long hair
17 year old crazy work ethic thats youll energy need less time recovery
dont mind make look fool friend raphinha mean he learning raphinhas work rate work ethic
barca everything protect instead running ground like swear bite as future
rooney hell talent want shag nan eat kebab could running messi ronaldo
depends balance mbappe bit build around psg forced rethink made work conversely real filled team player build around cant build skyscraper without foundation theyre yang yin
need balanced team multiple player dont want todo defensive work going work
psg started rebuild whole team mbappe left got young player good recruitment spent like 3 year get level 180 takeover time
psg much balanced previous 23 superstar never pressed whole team strategy built around never led example unlike say ronaldo madrid important player veratti many injury mad given league game mattered compared big ucl club recruitment since sought younger hungrier player rather established star rebalanced squad brought level intensity rarely mustered previous era
wont say implication
implication gon na hurt player
depends semantics firstorder logic point view definitely imply broad common way talking guess could argue although still find debatable weak
video show bellingham rodrygo tracking back blame mbappe vini
actually think vinis ego much bigger problem madrid mbappe much willing work team
mbappe imo signing marked return perez desiring big name functioning team beckham 20 term disrupting successful side signing unnecessary player mbappe beckham vini figo impact carrying extra player term workload huge throughout team lead others going half arsed
kinda short selling imo defense shamble even mbappoe arrived diva personality though complicated defensive woe like see clip least rest team could work together unselfish help already severely lacking back line instead main character syndrome
cant fucking serious lmao looked invincible leipzig bayern last year jesus
thats cause old guard left part mbappe lmao
liverpool press mile ahead real madrid madrid player half heartedly jog towards whoever ball real plan mind
dont see mbappe vini rodrygo pressing like salah firminio mane
dont exact press effectively
managed due manager lost shit every single person team running ass really think klopp would fine bellingham gif
liverpool workhorse midfield covering fullback though madrid dont think thats point made
raúl xabi alonso absolute uncertainty matter theyve never trained team full diva semidivas diva wannabe one
klopp isnt going real dont think many current squad would much longer
trent built alonso system he like rightfooted better version grimaldo hell fine
say would career suicide join dont know anything watching couple game year seriously dont know anything real madrid despite posting regularly subreddit always full news making stupid stuff
cant make mind feel bothwould like uruzilian
didnt happen ronaldo real madrid even though everyone making pas finish
yes dont make analysis team youre one making seem like game one guy pitch hence cause good bad thing ronaldo fair share link play scoring driving team winning mentality reason say team game never analyze 10 pitch besides ronaldo coach opponent team coach entire analysis ronaldo come result drop ronaldo bad cause bad result say actually performed quite match team ronaldo still bad theyd better every case always ronaldos fault performs youve crafted mind narrative causing problem like football team game yet never analyze team unhealthy obsession fixation ronaldo
whose nan shag
club danger
would ever hurt player im gon na hurt player
ohyeah thats rodrygo vini jr lol
team beat two leg cl lost 2 match entire season atletico matter bad played came back dying minute time time
good barcelona press year ago compared new manager change everything
also like camavinga valverde tchouameni bellingham history working pretty hard im sure go back find individual moment curtis jones tracking back well add klopp also desperately wanted bellingham must thought could job
valverde camavinga tchouameni
alonso florentino need swallow pride let xabi significant say transfer since obviously need specific profile system
yeah klopp want player asthma
play alonso tactic effectively ie winning thanks tactic aproach due superior talent madrid would need replace like half squad cover trent defensive liability need play either wingback 3 atb system like klopps best lfc season insured work horse midfielders fabinhohenderson etc
dude blind attitude showed club overall whining every decision match even game start entitled bully world football time play victim card every time loose addition given history liverpool real cl attitude real fan towards player bet taa would sorry year join
benzema sacrificed
jude bellingham side eye behind well certainly wouldnt danger
actually quite good lol level obviously injury still far beyond anything real madrid

true fehlgeburt german word miscarriage
nah used quite common insult grew got less common last year started little careful word still hear definitely far beyond said referee justifying harsh punishment one stupid insult grew people still use others might use automatically emotional
missgeburt casual insult german thrown around lot translate realise bad actually
translating insult sometimes make sound weird like correa recently hijo de mil putas translated literally sound like son thousand bitch
african country insult would illegal
first read post wondering inside info mum given insult
like even honest say lewa jokingly applying ref high 3 game ban weird even comparable weirdo case fully expect punishment similar
punishment probably 3 game lewandowski
lyon coach
even pepe ramos bad
mf started watching football 10 year ago
id say missgeburt even worse tbh
suarez bite player 3 separate occasionsand get lifetime ban dont think get one either hell probably get month
real madrid talking get away serious shit
common insult germany actually
true neuköllner
saw point yt video coaching staff thing could provide context

agreed thoroughly bunch precious arsehole
feel like
exactly edge shothousery like costa chelsea looked like decent human madrid become worst guess club culture
didnt notice assassinating de bruyne cl final
jude quite unlikeable dortmund
bellingham never likable he always whiner hot headed idiot
kid need bringing peg 18 majorly majorly bought hype especially since joining real madrid really show see performance england lad far arrogant good
unless last name kroos
bellingham already massive whiner dortmund thing madrid bring thier whining biggest stage
theyre like chelsea 00s like massive unlikeable whingy prick prerequisite
go crybaby club become crybaby matter time mbappé become one

bunch entitled brat cry complain whenever thing dont go way glad people dont follow la liga finally see embarrassing player really
thats basically classic definition freak
direct translation probably closest would calling someone inbred implies would physical mental deformation
probably similar cunt said time friend call someone cunt anger youll probably get punched
rüdiger adult adult rarely call missgeburt
young german hurenson pretty common light curse even used lightheartedly friend however context matter ton voice matter lot there difference said aggressively missgeburt however pretty heavy used actually want insult person
among young people everything meme adult call another adult missgeburt either get punched sued
think thats joke lol missed several potential penalty barca cubarsí ferran potential red card tchouamenis twolegged challenge olmo
nuance relevant russian anecdote petka asks chapaev vasily ivanovich whats nuance chapaev reply take pant petka ill show petka bit confused take pant chapaev come behind stick dick petkas as say see petka feel dick as feel dick as there nuance

anglo word freak usually good thing least ive heard positive context think inbred like negative
maybe abomination could close translation since implies deformity heavily idk scrambling idea
flid thats used people born deformity mother took thalidomide
whats german arrested development
light curse nah hurensohn used earnest one severe nondiscriminatory insult german language true internet culture people starting use ironically meme call someone hurensohn irl youre usually deep trouble
red modric instead fit yellow
ferran situation remember cubarsi call

club throwing massive tantrum dont remember doingsaying anything except 10 time harder pitch say anything else genuinely cant remember
sound bit telenovelalike aura never heard someone refer insult concept aura get mean doesnt sound insulting spanish almost quirky oldfashioned
completely lost meaning spanish look rae dictionary mean indeseable despreciable
aunque técnicamente ese e el significado nunca habia pensado que ese insulto se usara de esa manera
hurensohn became kind meme dirty sound people got little numb yeah probably worse get beaten said wrong person
think play leipzig known serial diver germany one dive
recall correctly timo werner song came massive dive resulted pen course played rb
hurensohn something say closest friend fun say anybody else deserve get punched face basically one worst insult language stock
get used get thrown around super casually younger individual
growing scheiss missge thrown around lot havent used really heard word used since 14
yes rack enough yellow card get banned game
idk talking easily violent footballer currently playing anywhere near top competition someone stepped arsenal player who like 18 taking hurt know wont get punished
time chair
get whopping 1 match ban
full respect object 3 match ban referee
80 comment anulo mufa learn another word
dude shouldve sent least twice u
miracle stomp ml didnt major consequence rudiger sent ml hospital heavy guy like stomping teenager groin plate hurt person life
ima honest youre getting dose la liga ref getafe others allowed shit constantly dont like rudiger usual shit even talking yesterday bigger problem ref allowing every team kind playstyle either unpunished lightly know ironic rmtv complaint want note fuck rmtv everyone allowingpromoting within club wish punished accordingly go club like getafe rudiger mbappes light suspension
mbappe leg breaker also got one game bitched
yeah partey piece shit hate still playing u change fact rudiger psychopath partey nothing rudigers behaviour
real madrid biggest legend rapist want chat
topic
reportedly relevance rudiger isnt point scoring exercise trying pit one bad thing another
there nothing racist he born raised germany there also nothing imply term discrimination since pronunciation perfect mean accent basic selection wordsmore like brocabulary make appear certain way match impulsiveness pitch nothing nothing less would make comment thomas müller well
sound black alright
classic high school bully behaviour
pepe spectacular meltdown general dont think actually dirty ramos far dirtier player two
pepes rough af watching arsenal like year ago brilliant wasnt dirty got respect fan way played incredibly strong ton heart hyping fan making tackle 5mins end rudigers nothing like fucking filthy arsenal bout week ago genuinely disgusting player ive seen pitch used like well even clip came repeatedly slapping old man work madrid like ahhh probly bad nah he piece shit
thats also correct pressure reveals people nature pressure get nervous get angry get panic attack etc
see people nose orbital bone fractured cl final time even regular top league play nothing say rudiger pitch dont know pitch he always thug dirty underhanded player intentionally injuring de bruyne ball chelsea cl final im sure seem think nothing
dont think orbital fracture happen football largely combat sport injury tell need know
name resembles club
yeah fair enough he 21 exactly kid anymore ancelottis job discipline player failed young player taught keep emotion check he many outburst like thing dont go way rudiger lunatic different thats change
need dickhead middle really bellingham growing idolising midfield partnership gardener bowyer ferguson actually shuld give u good cm limit much twat becomes
dont mind bellingham temper doesnt overflow get angry run faster maybe moan little go performance
exactly jude walk talk think need level
time think make good point 70 time pod bd also biased big lebron fan draymond really like lebron well thought covered sa v lebron feud pretty well doc v jj reddick spat year ago pretty well kobe goat debate question well etc he really good point like com across likeable rudiger really cold human good way
still chance league even barca beat vallodolid next week real beat barca barca still tough game like atheltic away
damn pep barca assaulted ref threatened forfeit match
recently history freak used positiveoutlier scenario full phrase usually freak nature aka aberration positive circus would identify peculiar individual people gawk theyd never seen anything like obviously longer call people suffering deformity freak
freak many meaning different context inbred probably closer meaning doesnt directly imply actual defect slur might match even closely wont repeating theyre slur
freak good thing maybe listen 1970s soul music
really though freak sometimes used positive way say someone abnormally good powerful usually mean someone weird strange could mean someone severe physical defect
understand thinking freak positive connotation consume english sport like others said word longer history negative
would suggest defect could pretty still
geistig hängen geblieben
true imo missgeburt level kind despicable word actually use someone sincerity
dude german lived germany whole life growing friend called hurenson irl around dozen time per week kid still like common least 1520 year wouldnt say internet internet culture anything definitely meme part youg people language edit also even used earnestly way one severe insult missgeburt example way severe
thats said potential penalty there argument made side give penalty dont tchouamenis challenge red crazy wasnt even yellow though least youre better fellow madridistas bellingham lol claiming ref thats true delusion
itd hilarious wasnt infuriating time club world football get away much shit real pitch pitch city probably slam
primary reason could never get board fantastic player best dm world time whatever kind conversation raging skill ability charming ref getting yellow getting yellow first opportunity present ref red card casemiro though felt like slam dunk red card challenge every match would see play would get yellow even completely absurd unless nefarious business going
thats spanish ref rather particular club go watch single getafe game lack card youll understand nobody claim getafe ref pocket
soft af
fascist also
used coach kid handball easiest way get rid unwanted behavior build natural instinct simply making impossible practice want player dribble ball less ban bouncing ball practice game want make shoot arm fully extended make jump two mattress theyre forced put arm way
nah even biased madrid fan lot team big ego push ref around admit madrid guilty never bad anytime vini loses ball look ref foul rudiger get away tackle prime ramos pepe never get away secondly find clip ronaldo losing ball asking foot foul ramospepe throwing stuff ref raise tone
sound like swedish surname tbh
face way think player learned want fan national team like cant play rbl
left u leipzig said something along line im excited go traditional club ascending traditional club peak leipzig hate time yeah top he diver also never really played well national team tbh people kinda forgot forgave he away playing like shit long time hate isnt nearly big used scored 25 goal season leipzig
closest friend anonymously internet
mean thats said previous comment though casual insult anymore 1520 year ago people also said racist stuff like neger lot cant really compare today
doesnt apply red card offense would make sense guess ive never seen plenty player make red card offense several time always punished individual incident
true institution rm player like within rank believe tough show actually deranged person constantly testing boundary get away stop properly dealt
referee dy
rudiger would fit well wwe ngl
hopefully darwin nunez wasnt chair throwing coach
hey thats alabas job
chest memory think less groin
groin could probably way worse rudiger fucking psycho
may age taught pepe basic respect top grade asshole rm literally use stomp player messis hand example ffs
pepe 10 year ago honestly worse rudiger imo yes pepe last couple year great without excessively dirty go back make rudiger look nice
dont condone body block football didnt go intentionally injured genuinely think need reevaluate situation hypothetical football dont exist chelsea could game 340 took clear cut chance didnt
didnt retired shirt number birmingham
ill give bellingham benefit doubt still didnt change much 19 21 still idiot mid 20
hey carlo busy chain smoking cant bothered disciplining player bayern player poor conditioning organized extra session cardio dumb as son even whined despite fault lack proper training regime might good coach eg ac milan chelsea first real stint nowadays he coasting immense talent player
yeah agreed he growing good way right need role model someone step sort doesnt bode well
get sent yesterday abusing ref second time season
cold day hell athletic try beat barcelona madrid hate madrid much barcelone dose
watch sport today even esports lol
always positive sport guy freak nature id like see someone post youtube link freak used negatively sport ive honestly never heard im sure must one two honest almost exclusively positive thing sport
sport music freak always good thing time ive heard anyway
yeah friend call sort shit always think would happen called bos coworker teacher cop etc hurensohn light curse would english equivalent son bitch hurensohn much heavier insult
dont know feel like sentiment rm sub similar mine didnt count
probably la liga mile worse prem pitch regard stuff nowhere close antic happen behind scene lawyer nationstates foreign actor
even var atm thats crazy ref indulgents rm
doesnt matter wouldnt get madrid game especially el clasicos even madrid fan understood escaped double yellow
somewhat related also unrelated make good story rafa nadal naturally right handed like us right hand everything uncle decided would better left handed player started training nadal play left hand he one goat sport imagine something unnatural becoming time great
dont see difference peperamos rudiger fact actually injuredassaulted player pitch rudiger least hasnt done yet least commend self critical nature rm fan thats something respect football come first
reminds popular german meme haha even though swedish look ina müller jürgen hurensohn youtube
ehh fairly sure ive heard preteen early teen use past year maybe used less neger hand never used insult younger time ever heard neger grandfather talked well black goalkeeper played
apply red card player typically get longer suspension 2nd 3rd red card season example year jack stephen got 4 match suspension getting 2nd red card season httpswwwbbccouksportfootballarticlescx2nlrj4nyvohttpswwwbbccouksportfootballarticlescx2nlrj4nyvo
would probably never considering player like pepe got away much end career everyone forgot reminisced good old time true legend retiring
two match ban
could absolutely see eddie guerrero style shit heel
one sure happened bit indictment rudiger couldnt tell team meant
youre right wasnt chest abdomen photohttpswwwfacebookcomshare1ki58epdqc fact even worse stomp chest there ribcage protect vital organ abdomen completely exposed
yes youre right didnt remembered quite well fact even worse lower abdomen completely exposed
yeah realised soon sent comment experience pepe probably like 5 game lol wonder genuinely dirtiest piece shit pitch player ever pitch onit
odd point didnt win 30 nil dont think even many chance city played rodri wouldve lost instead squeaking make excuse
dont condone body block football oh body block
signed new contract leaving dortmund got enough money go left free theyd finished
indeed retire birmingham number bellingham
top flight idiot teen behavior bellingham attacking saying bellingham truly despicable attitude
literally put less reserve side v real madrid league
think would happen called bos coworker teacher cop etc hurensohn nowhere op argue normal noncontroversial word use many word wouldnt use work environment
hurenson nearly exactly son bitch meaning similar also way used heavylightness think would happen called bos coworker teacher cop etc son bitch thats exactly think would happen hurensohn
cant argue
interesting aware thanks guess noticed since tag extra game two several month like suarez incident
decision appealed
lost rodri twice chelsea previous month two ucl final sort city number around time
block check literally thing mate try karma farming somewhere else
he saying like bellingham im 36 work age honestly lad und 25 still come across teenager time still immature hell dont even think ive fully matured saying see difference 19 yr old 21 yr old
tired ranger game expect barca thing dont change
worry yeah severity suarez ban certainly much larger others im aware outside gambling doping ban
suspension ref
werent playing entirety season two game prem game faced already league viewed game experiment fa cup game got lucky ucl pep didnt start dm completely switched game plan rodri came started playing way around 60 minute mark started offensively dominant late also pep starting main dm bad result throughout career 62 pep loss barca came busquets didnt play played less 15 minute example 201920 season fernandinho played position started losing drawing game even
get saying 19 year old kid bellingham attitude would seen extra dumb thats wouldnt fly people stop defending finding excuse behavior thats normal
10 point everton
fine damaging chair
probably best posting last part madrid sub
normal behaviour almost people express part development affected litany factor external internal difficult look individual say theyre ahead behind given age genetics life experience whats wrong normal dismiss work trait claim theyre better way refuse acknowledge impact others one self im honestly surprised see wording like truly despicable 21 year old who talisman nation dealing pressure thereof saw kicking monitor stand week seemed fair wonder frustrated he going get slew abuse lot racial google jude bellingham racial abuse get result various date recent example racism among real madrid fanbase well documented seems difficult see young man called truly despicable getting stressed mistake basically certain guarantee get abuse malicious bigoted thats intended break general conduct point towards hot headedness strength wording denial growth progress post doesnt sit right

he always prick germany aswell
mean one criticize guy hot headed theyre 20 year old im 43 guy working 24 look like kid need constant direction doesnt deal fame getting head
said 5050s 5050 decision likely talking getting overrun winning enough challenge
kinda understand sentiment pov general dont agree referee really fair allowed player play hard jude probably one suffered countless case fouled would count foul game even big bellingham fan hate see collective negative hive mind narrative far madrid best player night

vini hate getting ridiculous atp
vini as behaving good sportsman shaking hand acknowledging rival hugging friendscolleagues spotless
damn bias af

mason greenwood friend prick suprised
tbf like 17
great perspective fellow old like im old enough boomer im old enough someone bellingham age would call boomer 24 year old arrogant moron old still moron less arrogant relatively much less moron people reading probably 24 younger probably dont fully realize people change time yet experience change bellingham super human maturity term work ethic drive clearly subhuman level aspect maturity fine number retired teenager likely mature time hopefully response action get path humble he football genius still dumb kid
age nothing hotheaded theyre celebs treated like god slightest obstacle success sends rudiger one senior he hotheaded lot actually every factor except age
insult throw tantrum thing dont go way tho
im 32 guy working 35 act like someone needing constant direction age doubt factor people dont mature properly
yeah may think reach definitely seemed like frustrated team referee
still lost
he like decade
""
believe feeling even stronger combat sport adrenaline go youre kind reminded opponent going struggle pain sacrifice feeling respect mutual understanding usually take experience taekwondo tournament always bit terrified getting face destroyed kick lol
vini wasnt crybaby pitch would much liked around specially spain great lad incredible player step turf long leash playing madrid allows act like prick
agreed infuriating pitch bdo saga cringe there many fucking outright racist bashing without reason without limit decency disgusting
one percent

completely understandable upset loss rival let alone cup final
raphinha allison joke
certainly take
raphinha ballon dor winner
guard honour winner bit redundant theyve already extra honour team beat matter rather little losing team show winner respect acknowledge skill opponent gave best pitch
madrid fan care opinion jude best player im happy played second season 21 performing better experienced regular
watched entire game mate yea didnt track back ceballos caught ball watching also left top box open
tbf didnt know ter stegen squad yeah theyre literally captain theyre still player team even theyre injured except thing like carvajal incident saka there literally harm
bellingham acting way ive seen english player act losing international final sulk understandable getting medal take instantly show lack respect sportsmanship mean disappointed devastated losing thats totally fair fucking grace defeat well
rudiger basically walked without acknowledging dude even little bit normal cant imagine level cringe might feeling emotion wore
bellingham much sourpuss dortmund something he developed madrid
yeah vini get along well lot people think cause rival team cant friend opponent

great comment there allowance medium imagine every comment made outside house age 17 35 available public consumption nightmare fair he lot better would thats sure
he tested immense fame money etc though thing blessing burden time
anyone eye could see barca always step ahead first half dominating people see antireferee bias everything theyre specifically looking

apology wording imo come horribly asking mason greenwood one thing asking wht charged catchphrase popular online still popular he charged he innocent rebuttal perhaps overreacted perhaps implying greenwood wasnt charged therefor innocent
fact managed visit get pregnant opinion getting drop charge prof failure system enough protection victim offender like agree charged tampering absolutely failure protect
ah okay thanks clarifying
wouldve reaction said convicted instead charged charged police want convict convicted found guiltyinnocent atleast english teacher explained back day may wrong english aint first language
ah well misunderstanding english isint first either

yamal mold neymar messi pedri stole show rb kounde thank flick 2 put pedri bayern training regimen increased stamen general durability cause bit injury bug koundé went cb playing position maybe complete fullback world season
2 assist bit better good
thought pedri actually kinda poor lost ball lot including build goal
yamal far better pedri pedri relatively quiet standard poor 2nd half
pedri poor today standard despite goal lamine easily better got 2 assist show hero today backline however gerard martin surprisingly solid iñigo cubarsi kounde dropping incredible masterclasses cubarsi especially insane performance
dont rm fan speak hindu arabic
yeah shit runner cup 2nd league made knockout stage champion league sure fire ancelotti asap big club entitlement mentality something else

looking outside rm humiliated attempt influence ref var clearly worked extent yet still lost threw massive field wobbler someone spain explain fa allow rm run anti ref campaign long ago watching rm tv spain sat shock hour long show apparent bad decision pl recently notts forest got 750k fine social medium post suggesting var ref opposition team fan im guessing got point rm untouchable please without consequence
think ref pretty good game given circumstance var hand literal nightmare easy spot obvious rmtv rattle job worked
real didnt get pen incident ferran would six month campaign documentary produced go ballistic foul made mbappe due hand face garcia remember last season almeria goal chopped exact thing hard work producing next video prove robbery
think football today said thing
mean idk hed saying lost couldve given two penalty regardless fair play
yeah well said respect inigo great performance last night didnt expect become undroppable
overall pretty strange decision way im surprised barca ended without single penalty
damn football lol brought phrase
think football today neutral hard agree
clearly rattled premeditated smear campaign rm refused give yellow horrific tackle var guy even worse didnt even acknowledge penalty ferran cubarsi shirt pull rmtv need shut betterment league
ref good match pressure get least 94th min penalty check ferran check
dont know inigo martinez well enough know whether hold true kind comment referee whether win loses even though tend agree cant shake feeling he mostly able say case time around let say hope im proven wrong im highly optimistic
much right football win last night
madrid fan im ashamed shitshow end season became field agree shitshow pressuring ref madrid isnt worthy club like real madrid said ive gotten used every scrutiny face deserved scrutinised many undeserved said barcelona also history criticising ref literally last season ironically carlo defending ref criticising xavi ref rant saying think football today hilariously overlooking stance season prior aacting high mighty also people seeing influence papa perez rfef he got everyone ball even madrid fan believe time laliga get competent president set firm rule prospers new height rather ruled duopoly real barca otherwise laligas allure diminishing day day
yes well worth money spent negreira paying player complete salary thats good loophole make football win
madrid barca fan would calling ref corrupt sure game
tap merchant
he extremely lax player unable really berate thats everyone enamored 201315 tenure
he enabling behaviour year he plenty chance throw marker he intent noninvasive clearly detrimental culture dressing room toxic entitled spoiled team carlo much part issue always idle bystander sometimes also active participant he made either direct thinly veiled criticism referee
got early yellow bad mouthing 4th official he probably better
real madrid need felix magath
think get way president influential heavily encourages
perez people ball everyone really underestimate influential
florentino perez biggest construction guy spain construction western europe traditionally held mafia connect dot
like britain 80 medium unapologetically madrid fanzine 10 pretend unbiased varying degree success remaining 10 probarcelona imagine fan different club local newspaperradiotv best essentially public perception outside catalonia favoring madrid crime law universe
im surprised people watch rmtv isnt like club channel see replay old match highlight random interview people disconnected footballa 90 minute hearing reading news
perez one powerful person spain real madrid state supported club one take action maybe perez removed new president come power might decrease real madrid bos spainish football
dude tebas literally shout madrid fan every interview literally president laliga thats behaves medium
someone spain explain fa allow rm run anti ref campaign florentino perez one powerful business people spain
would say good chunk rfef support madrid perez also everybody ball way try influence player become free agent run contract join madrid free
agreed could approached game lost like men instead approached game lost like bitch rodri balon dor
real madrid tv bullshit overblown referee sub insane absolutely nobody watch channel completely irrelevant 999 population mean many people watch tv whole guy act every spaniard lunch put channel discus program family lol
id say bad game would one barca could complain madrid absolutely benefitted poor decision least got win thank god
pretty good game hard disagree absolutely rattled threat game addition penalty wasnt willing give yellow card many tackle madrid player
afuckingmen dont fuck men
he rock one best signing
3 pen shout one check var dive
havent seen handball none three bad decision fernan argument raphinha clear dive get cubarsi holding cubarsi scored goal ppl would mad didnt get ruled fernan one hard say didnt seem like much contact seen others mention there another angle
really cant exactly blame ref shitshow club face
worst decision pen given ferran real little moan claim corruption
oh yeah shit didnt give 2 pen given hate alright
natural game extra time
would call referee influenced rmtv hit piece true
player call guy got wrongfully denied please wait
work fucking carlo others would hardly work
mean realistically speaking supposed leave different situation considering obviously coming perez top purely player issue would get club culture instilled perez put leave
could really bad culture squad going forward respect og game dont xabi alonso would pull honesty zidane one could reign diva
perez influence many league rfef softly support madrid like tebas may even ambition part club administration future dont know xabi steer zidane aura though honestly suck good squad behaveplay like
perez read like mafia bos like president read
influential he president one club exert influence cause people fall line diligently
think construction anywhere held people strong like mafia
he good business
wildly inaccurate live galicia people antimadrid antibarcelona
thats really way way probably catalonia otherwise youd really blind believe
referee father accosted outside church talk son bias madrid kid getting bullied school father ref
think youre missing point doesnt matter many watch club tv channel
doesnt matter many people watch clear high influence otherwise wouldnt seen much drama
real gotten yellow least 2 penalty
barcelona 20 possible red card real could easily lost match rm tv would reason
dont tell
im talking cubarsi shirt pull dirty cunt catching ferrans leg behind imo clear pen clear come raphinha dive
didnt need check handball since clear rule isnt pen var check everything var graphic show screen
asencios right knee hit raphinas left ankle dive pen
actually think last two situation ferran raphinha dive actual god tier dive rüdiger v ferran see one perspective show doesnt touch shin another proof doesnt touch foot either dont think there another way rüdiger even touch imo there touch even tho 100 look like youre looking ferran raphinha situation clearer last perspective showed made obvious touch leg maybe slight touch hand honestly thats enough pen cubarsi one really tricky imo use arm lot duel think one situation awarded pen played depending ref definitely understand barca fan pen wasnt given team especially cup finale id furious
there one guy comment even though idk go argue coz know ive seen
im yet see
lol post amazing
nah corrupt thats saying barca match thread
solid pushback needed toxic mou era
exactly perez enabling kinda attitude top doubt carlo enabling kinda behaviour
xabi definitely would pull rm he carlo zidane obviously every trophy player he wellrespected time madrid manager leverkusen historic
friendship meme operate unit thats still question problem one toxic friend group feeding negativity balon dor snub prime example whole club throwing fit vini camaraderie doubt deal everyone outside
half season whiny bitch started way balondor saga
come eight month long coma
he president club big one mind he also construction billionaire multinational contract
he charge one biggest construction company world also hand large part energy service spain europe also close many politician side spain he also billionaire complete control probably biggest club world
he probably top5 people power spain
billionnaire help
he billionaire untold connection he made spain across europe cant naive
listen villarejo leak
something legacy franco history wire fucked people community island support good portion go real stature history dont really care football much band wagoning
private channel say whatever want journalism country wasnt fucking cancer would dismiss channel dumb real madrid fanatic would instead focus talking relevant thing
weve seen much cancer journalism country focus polemic thing know sell tiny bit respect profession theyd focus good journalist instead making ragebaitclickbait article regarding stupid channel
tchouamenis tackle olmo red
someone mention red penalty would put var fault ref var reaction time call ref monitor time thought ref consistent gave yellow gerald yellow many previous foul carded
think foul cubarsi shark checked handball atleast checked wrong decision made
rmtv video claiming penalty real madrid recently thing
cubarsi shirt pull foul ferran box raphinha dive
didnt need check handball since clear rule isnt pen hand positioned naturally fall didnt happen ball hit hand raised
actually opposite rule people dont seem know rule clearly state support sliding handball valverdes arm ground he risking handball sliding like pen according rule
ferran raphinha dive actual god tier dive god tier bait
actually watching didnt see rudigers foot touch ferran back didnt look like foul clear touched showed angle front clear day put foot underneath ferrans shin move side making impossible ferran retain balance foul cubarsi theyre grabbing cubarsi trying push away ceballos end horizontal air shirt halfway pulled he clearly obstructing reaching ball
1 ferran got foot lifted pretty clearly 2 raphinha get hand back wasnt touch foot dive 3 even pulling side clearly see cubarsis shirt almost clearly cant reach ball
nah one nothing blame point hypocrisy real worst decision going favour without seeking blame ref anything real madrid mindset
ah barca fan accuse referee
im sure rmtv another hitpiece chosen referee next time face since worked well time didnt face punishment disgusting
thanks broader context actually asking
make sense
lot owner billionaire dont deny he influential evident wondering guy connected way enable compared owner
spanish fa theory reason listen fa godlike power football entirely legally could imo maul madrid antic perez back way kowtow
link
political component older supporter sure indoctrinate youngest dilutes time depends team successful balearics ive seen change club visibly supported real madrid supported mile fcb started winning international trophy dominant nowadays lot barça support due younger people marked advent messi guess partly byproduct two team league polarization way harder understand premier league supporter betis spur fan dont get madridbarça bandwagoning ill say sympathy move towards team play entertaining football point time
ive lived spain life never impression im barça fan outside catalonia split closer 5050 8020
say whatever want similarly criticised bashed saying whatever want
shouldve sent first half lol
thats point var check everything narrative one incident reached var wrong may like decision var chooses intervene thats decided intervene havent checked
yes natural position trying make bigger
come thats reasonable take sliding arm neutral position embracing contact ground support body dont understand rule would written support claiming would slide arm behind back sure would reach ground one frame another video reach touch grass hand professional athlete think asking bit much
raphinha clear dive get
well least raphinha one dive ferran situation little blind see touch
actually youre right looking touch ferran slightly tip foot mightve little sleepy yesterday thought first perspective made clear foot doesnt touch still sure cubarsi situation tho one perspective genuinely look like cling onto beginning till end duel said probably give penalty id mad wasnt given team dont think clear situation dont think var anything
nah one completly false man use eye idk tell
look interesting early 2000s madrid debt sold theyre old training ground spanish government around half billion coincidence nicely perez taking control galactico era starting man hugely influential decade unfortunately one best
doesnt club
nah think pretty accurate live málaga people go hard madrid much barcelona would family woken madrid yesterday often firework whenever real get title
shirt pull still see even though pen according rule say pulling etc ok pen ferran explanation pen var reviewed didnt intervened thats even worse
people expect var check also call ref screen controversial situation said var didnt check something think people mean didnt call ref screen double check instead checked determined basis call main ref screen flawed system opinion spectator pov see field referee making call fair enough mightve missed thats var right var calling screen double check error isnt clear enough
blow mind people still think var playing clash clan phone referee phone like lifeline want millionaire think categorically wrong instance ferran itd bizarre system referee call var think he made mistake
isnt
people cant make mind want var clear obvious worst possible definition couldve come football really nuanced aspect var doesnt intervene get ton people saying people argue shouldnt ref really cant win game 80 call subjective
agree people change mind want believe general main ref called video review often ref make clear obvious error main referee double checking controversial call norm imo make everyone watching feel like transparent process behind important call communication nobody hear like ref change decision going screen still call nowadays id say change overwhelming majority case nature system think nba style challenge system without challenge var ref challenging main ref would make better experience
difficult implement something would satisfy everyone footballing culture always change think something along line nfl refereeing would lot better currently var intervenes demand coach coach 13 demand per game already becoming pain watch football call definitive anymore think shouldve mandatory year ago ref comms line hooked stadium audio fifa doesnt like idea genuinely think people would less mad ref understood pov 5050 call

la masia great manager theyve turned around
always turn around core footballing wholistic education philosophy instilled la masia always ensure decent team worst club buy good team play good stretch player eventually get old easy buy good team market forge one youth academy year year playing way youth systyem result need good manager flick 23 good signing suddenly compete everything laporta good lever using buy lewy kounde rapha balling u
la masia edit flick
one best manager like play attacking high line direct football top somehow assembled one youngest player play like seasoned veteran good mentality work hard within there 35 yo who one best 9 17yo may may next messi style play specific stats crucial team much impact hell football general like insane coincidence club thing
tbh seemed lost without messi plus vet needed time next generation take
still ref everything keep game today
yeah crazy watching rudiger clipping ferran behind obvious foul world getting even var review also hesitant yellow time absolutely deserved kept calling stupid foul messing anothers performance today easy 010 ironically rmtv didnt publish anything waited clasico wouldve showing whole world bad

fine overall maybe barca could pen real yellow nothing crazy
probably match ban always
mental illness
barcelona dominate game first half sure penalty madrid wouldve gotten barcelona 4 decent penalty claim turned id say crazy didnt get least 1 maybe 2
carlo much really flo signing made madrid unbalanced
day played like shit

actually dont think he much diva could even dying minute match wasnt throwing fit unlike madrid player
actually like mbappé agree likeable guy amazing player someone play real madrid cant root especially since ballon dor disaster applies modric like play croatia one favourite player could smile made pas koundé tonight
great respect mbappe always focused football even decision dont go way scared shit came breezed past martinez best cb season like invisible

vini threw well rüdiger think ref saw rüdigers
justifies reaction never foul
garcia dived excuse rudigers action

every time see player needing held back like blow mind game football fuck sake action shouldnt get stand get jail
looked like psychopath 30ish second second
barca penalty rightfully overturned imo funny thats time var intervened whole match iirc
madrid emblematic everything wrong world currently disgusting club
ive made exact connection well insane powerful always make underdog victim persecution
reddit really manages make everything u politics
olmo weird like 2 time got ball good position fell asleep

good first half good portion second half tired leg got
think highly theyre winning must someone elses fault ive never seen uncomfortable face went 20 arsenal first leg like brain couldnt comprehend happening
supporting hand thats presumed see rule exactly bc idk supporting hand hand isnt ground rudiger absolutely swiped ferrans planted foot
honestly feel like even worse season bałon dor event preceedings taking major highlight though happened
smokescreen let honest real played really badly whole season suffering almost every game matter play top got seriously whopped barca twice whole ref narrative complaigns schedule etc etc distract abysmal form team people would fair judging real performs season would quickly realise floro totally fumbled january transfer window
mean rayo fan
atleti fan managed pick one team who supporter actually worse madrid one

lmaoo new york
running rain
el clasico always delivers
instant classic game strike
lowkey banger striker finish
easy watch lmao completely dead leg around
yeah tired mess still time
genuinely aged 50 year game
cant blame theyre exhausted
fatigue severe
assist modric
knackered
120min team
hate team barcelona fucking deserve spend whole week cry ref penalty decision rule favor lose best timeline
cubarsi
yeah he fucking rock half defence
want run sitges holding hand together sunset
he stud wish chelsea sealed deal
wonder never rested
cant wait hear defend rudiger nearly assaulting ref
im looking forward theyll pull coming league match might get fernandez x2
happening bellingham leading charge apparently every 5050 decision went way
look like negreiras back menu
even worse waiting backpedaling away lol bone headed decision cost match
hate talk bad modric smartest pas across box given circumstance either
definitely fault mainly youd think modric wouldnt roll something slowly across part pitch nearby barca shirt either
literally first thing teach wait ball come
good pas modric either 2nd barca goal gift one wasnt much better either
moving away even started backing blindly
best pas modrić brahim decided even look ball
worse modric tho
pas worse
best player field today
billy fucking shit
need nice slice humble pie
fully deserved finish well
kounde expected
aaaaaaaaaaaaa
today floro today
didnt get red card he playing naked
best player match
hily indeed
thunderbolt outta back
horrible play around brahim honestly
chat shit get banged
broke streak earlier week actually
didnt see kounde lmao waaay casual
think brahim sitting still modric passed seen open space tried wait run
pause point modric release ball kounde isnt even frame sloppy player came 89 minute
learn kid always go towards ball
running towards kounde still got caught offguard good player scan field multiple time pas kind pas give time decide whether go towards wait booting towards brahim give option arrives later giving kounde time yamal catch almost certainly loses brahim one real madrid player thing expected expectation didnt arrive brahims side instance
yeah missed tackle work favor thats rarity
look rudiger tantrum sideline cant get enough losing side cry like baby real played well 2nd half field complete immature idiot
barca defend extremely well last 5 min swear add 2 min ref retire
good guy prevailed
brahim diaz lost concentration
longshot attempt comical time
thought pretty even going go got good finish
come youre neutral lmfao
wouldnt classify athleti fan neutral tbh
brahim diaz
lmao though comeon man thats brahim
mean assist get fucked
dont shoot dont shoot
tbf aguero said kompany youll become world class striker
glad listened
think portuguese thought éder 2016 final
please help understand
spend way much time
really lmao
poor guy
always today great
dunno havent enjoyed el clásico much year
messiesque finish
inter rubbing hand
inter time put sub tomorrow wont win serie might chance barca
even courtois look exhausted
defensive sharpness rigidity et even dead leg impressive defense mastered offside trap extent even fatigue cant hinder
brahim exhausted played 25 minute awful football point
rudiger swinging full punch ref end lol real bench jump
1 penalty decision valverde ceballos rudiger choose interpret one 100 pen 4 french commentator lequipe said tchaouemnis tackle shouldve red id believe
cancelled raphinia penalty 100 correct decision also ignored 3 call two opinion clear penalty valverde hand touch abyssmal didnt even land hand real deserved much still make noise end like eric garcia didnt get slapped bunch loser
even worse everything ref said got verified rüdiger nearly hitting thrown bottle
hate watch espn steve mcmanaman biased commentary
cubarsi fucking cheatcode play like 36 year old veteran age
give man flower
really many amazing 1718 year boy playing like fucking legend
cubarsi incredible game
gona run street new york
rsuddenlycommunist
cooling hand slippery ice accidentally slipped hand great acceleration
wasnt nearly assault
fernandez x2 refer ref name hernandez2
lost today even ref bailing give whoever theyll still lose
yeah id say mistake 70 brahmin 30 modric
option modric brahim didnt move backward wait ball would got
agreed strange risk take experienced player
ball totally fine diaz spatial awareness would done anything except running away ball
think 5050 poor ball poor anticipation
dont know anything football space go towards ball get take first touch still nobody player play real madrid minimum moreover counter attack always consisting one midfielder taking carrying ball midfield 1 winger go wide striker come receive go towards winger side pattern played 1000 time last 15 year real madrid history professional football analyzed counting scenario go wrong otherwise decision would good enough ever
didnt better option fair
depends pas made yeah always annoying pas ball someone stand
beloved croat gave alwful pas stop defending
immense area
he good 2nd half time extra time
margin weird see pedri getting tired early
nah he actually underrated af
best full back world
im tired watching absurd stamen quality well
easy also prevented goal
doubt cutting cross front goal consistently going forward frequently including fantastic strike
yamal tchoumemi valverde pedri would like word
running stiges helped cardio
made mistake tchouamenis goal tbf immense performance
silly fucking shit
true hily moment
vardy madrid confirmed
vardy party
kounde really got burner get
xd thought thing
funny part ball actually reminded kdb aston villa final day
bruhhhh cant stand goal
context httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcauy0ffdf2chttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcauy0ffdf2c
season clasicos cinema tbh
season definitely delivered three time
didnt enjoy 04 spanking month back
playing tomorrow travel got unlucky pope death
everyones juice european competition battle attrition point
lol looking fresh
rubbed really hard milan big team cooked point season wont make much difference
also dead lmao
inter might tired
put player cryosleep wednesday laporta beg need rest
inter got demolished ac milan 30 yeah iam convinced best shape either
inter looked completely dead v milan
yeah let see loosing 03 milan one day less pause also catch especially point situation cant chill whatsoever win rom
inter schedule bad barca playing every 3 day end march till mid may
look worse fucker combined
wont win serie chance barca likely way around
still
first place serie
ok lol
rudiger speak im trouble also rudiger let talk
cant believe ceballos didnt get card game either wth guy prick
valverde maybe two
almost forgot valverde handball commentator ref moved smoothly almost felt like dreamt
fact still solid 67 year prime terrifying prospect theyre literally even done growing yet
tbh lot world class almost world class youngster nowadays everyone get player diet training tactic super young theyre basically 24 year old time hit 18 teenager body guy grow bit earlier basically 24 year old 21 year old body
gon na celebrate running sitgis
crossinh atlantic swimming
yep wasnt absolving brahmin he got go ball also one freshest player pitch
much modric imo tired tired pas
never totally fine pas mean stating brahim needed spatial awareness indicates much risk modric high risk low reward kind pas
simeone right diaz rated milan level count fortunate many minute season real madrid due poor recruitment injury issue
weird comment
sure ig u dont fucking stand wait ball come like 6 league
well kounded player world
mean happen point
yea getting sloppy second half giving away ball including one led free kick mbappe scored
he anyone watched barca know he best rb world he cb
flick resting mallorca earlier week mightve ended game kounde still energy 115th minute
fuck well take might job
vardy trolling barca fan would something see
funnily enough dont even mind one anymore great way club legend sign got next season also help kompany class act around
muchas gracias
easy say lol
chaos tonight strong feeling 4th clasico gon na pop even
im sure must good neutral pure shock value hadnt dominated madrid like long time
people saying havent watched single el clásico season
loophole take serie game extra time
must win game
planned
match delayed pope death
also thuram injured massive loss counter attacking strategy
time around inter got hit volcano luck
sound like reverse 2010 volcano iceland minus difference dont travel bus
really feel like burning player really badly time go
always battle attrition remember one time united pull fa cup compete cwc late 90 early 2000s really succesful club reach around 70 game season due two different group stage ucl
least didnt play 120min day make tie bit balanced
arsenal psg fresh tbh full rotationrecovery mode prepare cl fixture league reach psg ligue 1 two week ago
hows psg looking atm
yeah valverde one wasnt pen weve seen previous incident already ruled favor pen two var trying hard get real madrid bad side intervene game fear backlash left ref everything unbelievable
truly dont understand youre downvoted slide tackle pulling arm arm natural position
seriously pity ref go went shake hand game ended looked like cry people talk lot madrid yesterday im barca fan never liked respect yesterday
actually going thursday hopefully ill bump
see replay kounde soooo far away pas made brahim doesnt go towards ball im inclined say brahims fault go ball never happens schoolyard stuff
much lol yes pas bit stronger brahim go towards ball slowly go away seeing pas bit slow also would understandable brahim tired 120th minute got 89th minute run like crazy passive like
guy got ball started 20m away guy shouldve got ball 2m away say fault guy passed utterly insane top top level pro footballer pas way fault must think team commit 50 error game smh
disagree shortly ball leave foot pause video see massively closer ball brahim kounde like half distance except kounde bombard towards brahim literally stand spot
guy assigning blame anyone else trying protect modric lol like 90 modric hitting shitty underhit suicidal square pas edge box
evolution since joining u kind crazy first cb played position lacked natural rb turned solid defensive fullback he developed attacking ability filled almost decade long hole rb
would say neutral maybe except man utd fan seem root madrid
tbf game even lost id say cinema wouldnt happy result though
think itll win madrid tbh weve played 120 min well play 3 game clasico whereas madrid play 1 gon na incredibly tired going game
30 minute injury time go
ban football game 3 daysinter played saturday play sunday
yep tired looking tired leg face player valverde almost breath
mean fair today match lot intense there lot running pressing although medicine conditioning progressed significantly since however really feel like wasnt bad late 2000s 2010s
previous question 120 3 day rest worse 90 2 day rest
play tomorrow pope funeral travel barcelona one less day rest plus travel
good thing two playing well play either final well rest inter almost gassed
mean huge injurysuspension issue regardless havertzparteygabriel spine team least team rested huge
psg got biggest advantage whereas still tight title race
psg dont look fresh team playing like recently either neither guy
yeah play wont big advantage final either barça inter would week final league game
distinctly remember identical situation involving pique year back probably real given pen
still respect havent paying attention
start running suddenly appear zoom past
passing across top box much school yard stuff going pas
square ball front box opponent youre pressed definition high risk pas
play weak pas across box situation suicide weight pas brain dead decision first place brahim obviously come would cleaning modrics mess
barca almost 5 day rest 2nd leg inter game league el clasico home
flick developed taste beating madrid allow team switch
valverde almost breath cant true surely
yamal right chilling
fake news boy defeening 115 jfc player
probably
previous question 120 3 day rest worse 90 2 day rest edit anyone curious here infatigueable ai overlord opinion really sharp question actually super practical understanding real player performance risk answer 120 minute 3 day rest worse here broken carefully physiological side scenario 120 min 3 day rest 90 min 2 day rest load body extreme glycogen depletion microtears muscle soreness dehydration risk high normal top player recovery needed 72 hour ideally 4872 hour manageable handled smartly inflammation higher peak 4872h heavy load moderate injury risk high full recovery isnt achieved high manageable 120 minute isnt 30 min often 4050 physical load extra time frantic tense sloppy meaning lot highintensity sprint deceleration explosive movement player already fatigued cause compounding fatigue linear psychological side mental drain 120 minute especially tight emotionally draining match bigger harder mentally 3 day something like champion league tie 90 minute 2 day feel rushed mind body arent brutally drained realworld example team play extra time domestic cup champion league match coach often heavily rotate key player underperform forced play soon klopp guardiola ancelotti always talk extra time kill squad short rest example liverpool 2022 fa cup final went 120 pen 3 day later almost flat premier league v southampton practical recovery window 90 minute 48 hour heavy fatigue recoverable 72 hour close full recovery 120 minute 72 hour still fully recovered maximum sprint effort often need 45 day true peak physical return final judgment 120 minute 3 day rest worse 90 minute 2 day especially right champion league tie explosive effort speed mind sprint duel everything would also like sketch manager might practically manage situation eg training adjustment save leg ucl match could interesting youre thinking tactical preparation lens want
120 really take life
yeah played two gon na long semifinal u psg outplay u lacking energy cant press time arsenal sit deep waiting u use meager energy first place hit u counter shit brutal
think theyve changed regulation specifically player going ground using hand support natural position may pen back dont think
hate much next barca fan still held high regard came football even gone disgusting club management happy lost sad way also 3 penalty barca werent given
true team like madrid make kind pass time high pressing playing back common think visual kounde running intercept far away brahim much closer still getting beat ball make look worse
wide open player brahim like 3 business day check shoulder see kounde coming 30 yard towards ball take single step towards pas hed easily shielded flicked ball past step towards ball pressure basic ducking concept he supposed drilled since school age
mean yeah doesnt mean never risky usually scenario spacegetting closed quickly brahim know 1 wait ball 2 keep ball long time wan na get fuck outta plenty space risky even ball thats kind slow brahim fucked caught sleeping even half second thats long enough get punished
brother level football youre criticising youre criticising 40 pass game get real school yard
risky pass happen getting pressed 2 player saw open space towards brahim much choice point want continue attack course hindsight wouldve better shot far away opposed pas definitely bit weak imo much understandable brahim came 89th minute watching ball looking right actually going away ball clearly going fast enough towards teammate getting pressed usually run towards also make open right
brahim stood hed gotten pas moved away though he midfielder reflex might run direction pas accelerate away
mean perfect pass always happen pas bit stronger wouldve come brahim acting cone would discussion even match sometimes correct teammate mistake brahims big blunder imo mean look start pas kounde playing 115 minute point moving towards ball actually took step
hope true
pressing tracking back lot match
messi started 30 chilling playing insane ball
sure chat gpt
also celebrate
donest include inter travel away game
yeah rival grudging respect little respect gone scum
flick already made clear there celebration win

least two lift left 100 maybe three
la liga take well earned break
madrid though
schedule clearly taken toll speed saw player past night day compared saw yesterday 60th minute playstyle also factor overall im concerned fluidity speed attack keep dropping example many dribble lamine attempt fran came visible impact second half class first half hoofing cross tiredness set lamines age concerned others squad generally give injury anxiety

dont think lot he got height advantage thing ter stegen cant like inch parry simply collect high ball might dangerous ter stegen today see tek beaten sort goal ter stegen eating ter stegen however baffling consistent weakness near post assume anticipates harder side give chance save far post level taller keeper huge sacrifice near post
ter stegen immense reaction covered lack defense many season tek confident competent nearly every aspect traditional goalkeeping he good shot stopper good air doesnt neueresque adventure nomans land first month adapted well rarely make mistake anymore let goal usually come incredibly high line combined late season fatigue araujo martin adept keep offside trap instead goalkeeping mistake happened rarely deciding factor loss
let calm
rudiger definitely

shame barca legend alex song robbed moment league trophy
abidal wasnt even captain
la mufa pasó de mitad de cancha
ter stegen sometimes 2v20 messi time stood still pretended shot hard
ter stegen dropped quite lot tbh 2014 till liv loss always top 35 world top 2 ball distribution neuer
tek also doesnt bozo moment like ter stegen he good set piece height style dont think ive seen concede big mistake like stegen 2 season ago would said ter stegen superior keeper though
still lot late tackle liking one dortmund funny
bro think chance
like baby lol thanks kounde helping sleep well get two bastard sent
cant even rest lamine cubarsi pedri kounde raphinha coming clasico end getting really close high injury risk territory basically themraph seemed slower past match cubarsi never get mentioned people conversation
part reason intensity dropping look running stats season youll see cover shockingly small amount distance well ucl vini territory he clearly instructed overdo theyve prioritized giving many minute possible
11 v 15 dont forget herbert pervert
afraid really dont know proof go check rm sub guy even justifying rudinger bottle throw excuse like passionate player would lose mind ref mistake
ramos mentality without ramos skill rudiger deserved red card
yeah come personal choice zizou doubt well ever get see something like threepeat squad unstoppable fun watch carlo delivered decima entertaining cl run time another entertaining one incomplete squad overall trophy real madrid history
imo
lucas ceballos rodrygo arguablyfran awful well
season saw player broke 1 v 1 heart didnt even beat faster consistent coming top winning duel surprise actually score beat attacker imagine form hansis high line aint team actively offside trapping successfully there still final bos get
bro keeper embodies bozo moment szczesny love sometimes make brainless decision
didnt tek give away penalty stupidly v dortmund even 2 week ago sure recovered made good game still saying doesnt bozo moment true
tek bozo moment even italy known negative trait mistiming coming foul player barca got plus collision teammate stem principle
tek also doesnt bozo moment assure
yeah late tackle seem desperate time hard pas full judgment since defense reduced memelevel certain point araujo definitely bad individual mistake
fran great man yamal lot joy dribbling side thing know lb done well highlight mainly passing
fran good though
many ter stegen ter stegen also seems pretty mid big match

honestly think ref handled match really well inaccurate whistle sure good luck reffing super intense match arguably famous rival club sport history 120 min match insane amount 5050s wouldnt say went one way also kept pretty tame even single actual fight
yeah let keep hating referee lead healthier culture football around cowardly move try put person brave enough go make decision game like every player figthing every trick bending rule trying find gray area get advantage sure referee easy job could better sofa without even thinking much
fuck talking especially factor awful spanish ref tense match much shit thrown around started ref really damn well

slapped ban enough cause damage season also way seems real madrid referee pocket maybe 12 game ban clasico people forget take two corrupt way see either ref complicit incompetent put ungodly ban flex authority revenge ref comment saga dont know proper punishment must book arbitrary otherwise corruption
come corruption favor real already obvious anyone who honest amount questionable decision benefited past year point think real player would get away literal murder anything change

madrid dna entitled whiny insufferable club world literally never stop bitching treated unfair demonstrably true
cant argue asshole part draymond green dray one greatest defender game ever seen attitude wise pretty similar skill wise level
rüdiger vázquez third bellingham according arancha rodríguez cadena cope though marca note still waiting report
option one three serve ban
nobody understanding german clearly called ref son btch hrensohn like 5 time really loud went ahead mute sound
tuchel deserves lot credit coaching rüdiger play clean chelsea one collision kdb think biting incident im remembering correctly pretty much ever since he moved madrid idk clearly he given free reign dirty possible
sub understanding sarcasm lol
upvote ignorance
fit right
galactichole
bro make pepe look tame
likely minimum 4 411 aggression towards ref many carried league game
remember video fucking dick kit man ive wanted since since he good wont happen
rudiger receive huge ban fucking hate prick shot madrid ban ramos pepe around decade
yeah club continue encourage aggression towards referee like always pretend he hard done
worse pepe trying remove player spine boot doubt
brother whole club lmfao vini rodrygo
reality top madrid wanted make u world thing would say perez distract fact yous arent winning shit year despite year chasing mbappe rudi losing head mix little nut anyway plus madrid leadership trying demonize referring team
probably vini since also rushed onto pitch like vazquez
fabrizios post say jude got one
think three including rudiger 3 received match total vazquez bellingham vini
webpage saying bellingham
damn one football sending red card viewer really tough enjoy three match suspension
fast read sentence lucas got one received one double take
wtf bitching ferran didnt get penalty modric didnt get red
hopefully
bellingham 3rd red card
guess vini
four rudiger complete meltdown
shock entitled prick team
real madrid z
city v forest definitely 430 game
may 11 clasico
really depends referee writes postmatch one word mean 3 match another 1
yeah read thats case let hope rudiger least doesnt play get chance beating madrid
probably 0 match given play real madrid
fucking clown mentality midget soon dont win speak experience watched team ucl
bro wondering liverpool fan started hating sudden completely forgot trent also dortmund fan hating whats going
cant wait rm defense even shit already worst seen 25 year watching game
german word feeling
everything literally every single thing couldve gone wrong madrid went wrong including fake remontada cockiest player getting red card post match satisfying
take carry league spain different setup
hell put sheet clearly going play ball receive 1 match ban
100 usually post match statistic fixing make everyone happy
missing least one penalty forgetting card real player often keeping tchouameni pitch far solid job understand pressure seems worked
think ref amazing job match like he consistent similar situation team
missing least one penalty forgetting card real player often keeping tchouameni pitch far solid job understand pressure seems worked
didnt crumbled correct decision
oh come var could atleast reviewed ferran cubarsi incident pedri olmo hacked multiple time first 30 min without action referee encouraged petulant behaviour madrid favouring overall prematch pressuring sadly still called thief
besides giving 2 clear pen without counting raphinhas dive cause clear dive also carding half madrid team yeah would say handled pretty well even hard blame man inconsistency drama
5050 call went favor madrid 2 clearish penalty barça werent given bunch yellow card given l vázquez tchouameni rudiger asencio kicked shit barça player game let see writes game report rudiger get 610 game ban bellingham probably insulted get multiple game rmtv likely spin ref saying showed disdain bias
yeah thought onfield ref alright thing considered var hand seemed little bit biased
first half pretty disastrously pretty fine rest match worried madrid boycott wouldve made nicer im glad job end
hate sympathy
wasnt good man first half letting madrid get away shit ceballos slap yamal ceballos pull cubarsis potential tapin tchouameni scissor tackle asensio behindtheback tackle became better match went though
great comment
oh rm fan honestly quite disappointed madrid chooses focus non footballing thing try influence game outside pitch despite one best squad cant defend cant attack cant pas keep protesting like entitled kid
thats clear card foul olmo pedri werent even considered first half ref clearly influenced madrid pregame pressure tended favor overall
think carry offence serious mean three match ban carry league whole situation mbappes red risk playing got least three four iirc
carry next cup amtches ban 3 game remember mbappe red card debate banned also league game
reduce 1 match ban im sure chance madrid appeal get rescinded
believe less 3 game ban spain believe doesnt carry domestic competition theyll banned first round copa next year similar madrid got disqualified tournament missed cheryshev suspended copa fielded
rudiger pepe ramos term shittiness
mbappe got 1match ban horrific tackle dont see three player get anything
also gave 2 existent pen real offside saved u
also two scorer shouldnt pitch mbappe suspended tchoumeni seen red earlier
blatant pen
nothing worse pepe
rudiger fucked id rather throw ice pack distance pepe winding kick like he trying make pride soccer kick compilation
agree pepe ramos got hot headed always losing classicos played super dirty amount dirty tackle rudi world man dancing around getting red every game
pepe committed legit assault
pepe straight assaulted assaulted football player
tbf pepe opposition player referee
bro really forgot prime pepe httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjkt4ibxd5oohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjkt4ibxd5oo
like mbappe got trying break guy leg
ronaldo got 5 match ban slight push exact ref way rudiger doesnt get least equally long ban say cause object didnt make contact
ref watched classicos real got repeatedly whooped guardiolas barca could see man mission break leg
looked like throwing arm protest anything nothing could see definitely swearing ref red
jude think
1 point behind win clasico hope kill
entire knowledge brazil could certainly summerized roughly dozen sentence whenever banter instantly connect cuz kinda vibe balkan banter cheer
thats hilarious
wouldve crazy chance there one game classico three 4 point difference
real madrid israel football
reddit try get political moment
shouting profanity german
anyone shout hold back actively choosing act like mentally unwell fully aware he behaving wrong anyway
funny part rudiger saying whatever guy first locked saying ayudadme ayudadme help help bcs looking helpless trying hodor
kpeele style
doesnt fight anyone fight back
let em let em
theyll explain tomorrow respectfully like jude never seen dislikable squad utter bellends
unhinged thing respectfully
player yeah rudiger actual mental case know
nah played role like anyone held back people act like fight someone real football pitch let alone ref
yeah draymond green still amazing defensive player rudiger awful tonight
watching casemiro rm made blood boil anywhere else would finish half match played
get people mad rudiger right dude really good player he idiot he one best cbs world
ref need pay fine

ancelotti giving freedom express
old biting incident
calling collision twat deserves intended smash kdbs face
always felt kdb purpose general opinion around time accidental thing time proving likely right
oh know
many time copy pasted
replacing ramos something even insane
wasnt clean chelsea right dirty cunt
man really posting exact comment every single thread game
dont need discipline impossible punished devil club
minimum clearly doesnt mean anything anymore though given mbappé got 1 match straightred already accruing enough point 2 match ban per la liga rule mere week ago
yeah there good bit reacting like dont lad know every generationally gifted teenager barcelona madrid balance wall wall fucking lunatic yin yang spanish football
report x vini jude went ref ft ref showed red unclear
yeah looked like threw something well
mouth know
probably told referee fuck like always always whining
sub pr machine meltdown jude mean guy say zidane prime
hope didnt deserved finish 90 minute dirty cunt
almost killed dani olmo
saying mbappes foul wasnt foul
happened modric must missed something
unironically yes someone hate losing doesnt anything delay inevitable
draw game please
mean id probably lost isnt long ban though wouldnt surprised time
rudiger looked purest seething rage eye man murder safe save three men holding back feared life right thats game ban
would disgrace rudiger got away lightly
fuck hope guy humiliate please bro
today game think seriously injured dont see playing anymore season
also would great player physical health
guess team dortmund lost ucl final last year easy hate madrid year given whiny bitching record
brother liverpool lost two ucl final madrid within 4 year plus another elimination surprise edit even trent drama
ive seen chelsea fan supporting barca madrid recently really say something
cause madrid robbed two ucls
sudden
everyone hate successful team sport universal
generational hate watch
rudiger one definitely carry leauge jude lucas vini red bad enough 3 game ban yes likely else itll next conpa game next season
ref doesnt control var room well game especially considering la liga ref normally like
1 var review ref responsibility 2 said inaccurate decision much madrid favor first half think time went less less whistle balanced et anything barca better whistle 3 real v barca literally hardest match referee ever super aggressive also super high stake everyones eye ref especially built pressure rm ref match really hard take bias whichever way situation like
cubarsi ceballos grabbing mutually almost last second thats good call agree ferran incident merit review though dont know caused fall
clear penalty 100 pulling barca match thought ferran penalty soft even cubarsi one could argued double foul agree first half reffed pretty poorly term real getting away many harsh foul real expected
mean tchouameni got card wrong color
var made job lot harder two penalty call shouldve happened got support
talking youre one talking ref supposed failing
dissapointed although seeing rudiger behaviour wouldnt discard long ban let hope cant play u next week
im barca fan two definitely pen imo werent offside
getafe meltdown ill never forget
pepe better defender rudiger
pepe ramos thuggish pitch rud thuggish pitch
pepe worse inmatch cuntery rudiger worse combine inmatch outside pitch cuntery
first red madrid uniform
ramos pepe bald headed baddie
surely mbappe one considered really need go spec saver attempt play ball straight trying injure ref probably insulting good minute needing held back long ban
either way subbed player entering pitch screaming swearing ref surely deserving red anyways
want optimism
weve lost past 4 game barca
basically didnt play today
many u region north argentina south brazil balkan descendant yesterday learned town near live biggest montenegrin diaspora
ah ok thats bad lol
game
politik
human right politics
look who talking bayern fan
yeah hurensohn mistgeburt easy hear hahaha
scheiße edit spelling
holden mein baken
rudiger mentally unwell known accepted
wouldnt say mentally unwell think anyone mentally unwell charge towards target without shouting people hold back say hold back come across performative overly dramatic someone whose anger take seriously like sure go ahead release see would id surprised anything physical
like hold back mean posturing actually unhinged wouldnt ask people hold back
wasnt shouting hold back
guy used hang bit mental picked lot fight bar would really try go someone holding back one day got sick happening let go going total aggro surprising got as kicked stopped hanging
yeah welcome hyper competitiveness capitalism behavior happens corporate world among rich politician etc visual sport since already physical activity behind closed door politician get angry irrational an go make policy harm without power
word choice actively choosing exemplifies dont know youre criticizing
player routinely get 35 game ban spain saying ref bad robbed translate stuff rudiger saying like 10 bad german insult much worse kind stuff lol
im glad somebody said think theyre worst bunch twat ever recall
chance never 0 ofc never know edit plus already got red card
replace casemiro sergio ramos pepe arbeloa still hold true got culture thing point
guy like
smashing another player face intentionally taking important game life know usual stuff seriously rudiger deranged player two biggest incident couple year chelsea make tuchel prime candidate best psychiatrist time collect 2 jail worthy moment per game
seriously mind blowing case arent reported police im aware press talk much make clear behavior consequence beyond football field important set example amateur football live there problem violence society large yet amateur football become frankly scary people starting use outlet violent urge knowing there realworld consequence unless go way way overboard course inherent risk sport step field agree youre victim eg bad tackle let referee justice im also happy dont fear legal consequence everytime step field long exercising fairplay biting part agreement fuck biting fuck biter uefa making joke allowing biter ever play
thing time proving likely right time really didnt change much issue stuttgart took detour rom signed big club plus dumb shit afterwards doesnt mean specific incident cant different
anyone saying accidental stupid day yet see player make front challenge leading shoulder aim stop kdb arm would come drag back aim hurt
something head week really since lost head today seemed like good time talk rüdiger genuinely player chelsea watch replay crazy see many dirty play he started regularly since moved madrid think people dont fully appreciate impact coaching staff behavior tuchel literally used make player practice tennis ball hand couldnt grab onto shirt seems like madrid told approach different philosophy try disruptive possible
prolly pr merchant curse ref
nah threw hand dissent
rudiger genuine embarrassment
complaining ref half time tunnel
respectfully though
thats english term endearment
another cunt get red card surprise
winner
tchouaméni red well tbf
olmo hit many time first half
tchouameni rudiger first half tchouis foul atrocious looked like straight red guess referee pressure worked well
even expect oh shit youre right award real 2 complementary goal
made pretty bad foul havent gone back look though see bad really
sure score goal forefit game
time wouldnt surprised even bit xd
disgrace rudiger get away lightly
hard there harm trying said win celebrate together
psg fan complaining ref benzema call wrong decision happen get move stop bitching
cause madrid robbed two ucls
superstar usually join barcelona suarez coutinho example
one definitely better side first final yea
poor guy also tried give madrid 2 penalty ruled offside normal time barca 4 yellow madrid 2 serious reflection game hate evident ref enabled madrid play wwe style football given yellow card match red card post match
ferran one definitely penalty even cubarsi one rudiger effectively lifted ferrans leg knocked balance complete possession ball undebatable cubarsi one think definitely tough situation assessed referee agree instance var make clearer quickly glossed like didnt even happen
ronaldo got 5 match ban slight push exact ref way rudiger doesnt get least equally long ban say cause object didnt make contact
thought stonewall pen replay cam made doubt didnt see enough clip sure either tho
casillas got pepe pitch telling order madrid shirt doesnt look like anyone control sideline respect squad time captain manager dressing room must issue
scythe opponent back moment iconic
im defending lol absolutely deserves rudiger season club ball would cwc pointing didnt look like vini threw anything throwing arm entering pitch mothed deserved red suspension leauge multiple game probably
hey maybe ancelotti gone game happens
really thought best player vini rodrygo terrible jude great game
sub want talk want
fotze want know actual word
missgeburt
mean shot switch e
funny easy act like 50 yard away performative prick
honestly ive always felt saying im crazy guy tactic smooth acting like bully mentally unwell hyper word want describe bully seems enjoy dirty tackle tried humiliate japanese attacker whole world watching make attempt avoid stepping mile lewis skellys chestgroin whole thing staff madrid saw yesterday
talking youre asking held back youre consciously aware youre lunging forward actively choosing
hat er gesagt
imagine conte jose managing lol
got ta little specific lol
probably cussed accused bias
joke friend
bluenose obviously unlikeable wanker lmao
glad didnt get red needed pitch deliver assist kounde
ill never forget cancelled red courtois either absolute clown show
reminded ramos saturday night fair
nah definitely worse side first final last final however probably haunt dream rest life
cmon much hate dont think say robbed u bad performance final cost u karius keita like come said ya getting knocked 4 time 6 year hurt lot
example liverpool player join madrid iirc alonso owen macmanaman arbeloa trent
also felt hellbent going referee sure whatll happen people bench didnt stop must add something right
definitely missing quality captain ramos would kicked rudiger
feel cosy blame coach time doubt would change anything next classico
yes youre right
dont dictate talk long civil breaking rule
open forum mate talk whatever want dont want engage simply scroll past
aint guy scored winning goal 2014 world cup final
know lol thought funny
lol ja da andere ergibt auch wenig sinn danke
consciously aware actively choosing people hot head freak easily dont really handle thing anything passively choosing psychologist instead call something like impulse
hurensohn etc
lol lmao even
karius concussed madrid cynical foul salah knocked ramos first half im totally comfortable saying entirely different match without thing would every possibility winning
true like going gaming convention trying talk agriculture allowed yes people would prefer didnt anyway hope good day
lol close enough
pretty sure mean guy leather jacket happy day
well far im concerned certainly fotze
worry like spreading knowledge knowledge mean curse different language
thats literally way people try justify domestic abuse control action youre consciously aware youre performing thus stop sympathy violent men try claim impulse youre monkey grow
ramos still believe without final karius would gone commendable keeper maybe world class level someone like kevin trapp something
gaming convention conversation naturally turned agriculture id problem discussing tbh
well judging upvotes vote seen people prefer hope youve learned lesson haha jk way fuck people gon na learn

dont think youre getting point

close reddit nobody making look
sub post thing different angle time lol goal foul save etc today reposts madrid player losing absolute mind must pro barca conspiracy happening behind scene
agree way worse lewandowski need much longer ban doesnt mean shouldnt banned saying banned touching nose disingenuous doesnt help cause talking actual injustice like mbappe one
didnt see whole game second yellow well deserved
there discourse insight expect sub
literally never seen comment white player far psychotic player rudiger sure go ahead
never forgave pepe moment 2009 dont care he long career crossed line rudiger far gone line anymore

gattuso never unsportsmanlike cant compare like vini rüdiger bellingham
yes guy literally arrested multiple time assaulted wife rudiger look mean player sometimes overly aggressive thanks proving point
far got 2 example barton suarez literally assaulted people arrest worthy stuff keep proving point
dunno downvotes gattuso hard player never noticed would dirty behaviour person like
guess thuggish prison skin colour human race messed apparently
nobody proving point made argument nowhere stay true username brought skin color everyone else speaking behaviour
people seem mix 2 thing
thats correct rudiger never assaulted anyone isnt thuggish either hot headed ramos one ever said ramous would prison played football dont like bringing race stuff bet house guy wouldnt say rudiger white
mean ive seen anywhere else thats assault jail rhetoric ramos quite time regarding salah challenge equally thuggish barca fan even villain besides chucking something someone head frustration anger could well considered assault thats beside point
rudiger literally assaulted real madrid staff member long ago

correction 2 game suspension standard real madrid player
calm arda turan still played match throwing shoe linesman comparatively little
feel like one actually multi match ban wont able nudge decision using referee report mbappe got away report lying going ball there defence rudiger
straight assaulted ref fucking way doesnt get lengthy ban
much simpler rfef go easy foul play come weak official getting abused especially shenanigan real pulling week would expect come hard rudiger
completely different bad tackle rudiger get lengthy ban
know team fucking cooked point best player world performing level carlos might even get sacked sad sight
wish would stop narrative mbappe got one match ban ref report determines long player player club even rfef

people really doubting want see revenue bring championship infinitely accessible viewer least u could pulling unprecedented deal club like
also think owner go two hollywood actor actually quite good ethical 99 club
dont see problem wrexham bring local international attention lower english pro league also completely legally really think mayority people hate fan team owner instead success owner completely destroyed team
idk everyone seems pulling part reasonable people doubt challenge quick rise pyramid didnt think criticism coming negative place
would understand hate happened germany wealthy owner completely normal uk theyre even wealthy compared club owner least isnt vanity sportswashing project like lot investor seem genuinely care helping historic club community theyve made huge effort involved fan
yea many disaster story much richer owner practically destroy small club buy business move vanity project even toy play none amount success ryan rob seem genuinely invested show mean saw show fodder wouldnt put effort focus improving city well show yea seriously lead fan coaching player buying
think people annoyed way promoted tv series ad appealing u audience different worked medium men used medium promote team billionaire could buy altringham pump amount id say people would less pissed
constant fairytale bollock peddled medium reality theyve midtop league one squad since national league first year theyve actually exceeded expectation dont hate spending money hate everyone else telling im supposed think impressive outspend every team division win
honestly fucking pathetic fan team national league football league obviously jealously idea fan club league would upset club getting wealthy owner actually engage fanbase community successfully smartly invested club help climb division people complain team winning trophy every season faceless billionaire owner tie goverments country extremely dodgy human right record buy club new club get wealthy owner spending money attracting lucrative sponsorship success somehow bad thing dont know people want wrexhams success somehow abhorrent man city psgs
smaller team success investment good business model feel unnatural lot people
extra hate isnt really new owner buying investing happens time club get hate nothing like around medium circus around documentary every match always medium talking wrexham owner often hyping plucky underdog wrexham fairy tale better player spent money opponent lot case course fan lower team feel disrespected championship subreddit people dreading reason wrexham less amount certain manager well medium know little championship club everything becomes frank lampards coventry wrexham done well get 3 promotion even money completely fault medium doesnt mean people like

michu goat
say want money like said many many owner richer well tried buy way didnt work recruitment absolutely top tier club seems run incredibly well
look class 92 salford city ever want compare story wealthy owner taking lower league team night day
ill admit never heard wrexham documentary ive followed along since national league pretty cool see casual follower across world id imagine town absolutely buzzing right
bandwagon fan dont get congrats
httpsenwikipediaorgwikilist_of_owners_of_english_football_clubsleague_onehttpsenwikipediaorgwikilist_of_owners_of_english_football_clubsleague_one would put 8th richest owner league 1 season though lot incomplete data list figure birmingham ownership spent almost 10x much transfer fee wrexham year
theyre best midlevel championship team right though ryan pretty damn wealthy wealth still tied acting career separate investment
wouldve year
there wealthy club championship rob ryan afford 515m x 10 player
already true league one
theyll one wealthier owner league one despite reply suggesting theyre crucially also willing fund club owner revenue would higher league one club probably birmingham higher loss likely higher top likely spent squad team except birmingham next season first theyre top 2 3 based revenue playing budget also probably wont near bottom championship
werent wealthy league 1 standard
also hating hollywood money kind ironic since compete oil money higher
imagine american fan dont really know sport crushed theyll majority next season adjust accordingly root wrexham
fair neither billionaire yet
hater proper shamble today

also going interesting insane money national league league 2 theyre league theyre longer rich far ownership go
fine bottom half championship isnt massive step l1 judging oxford portsmouth huddersfield rotherham done respectively season sunderland reached playoff getting promoted long ago
depending goal want anything fighting survival day 1 theyll need turnover probably 9 10 xi
hello jamie vardy
theyll get vardy reckon
people saying since first promotion theyve consistently improved every season
need stop signing 36 year old player played prem besides mcclean really lackluster signing
imagine theyll loan mullin subsidise wage cant see l1 l2 side paying
mullin hardly featured 2025
mullin deserves score one pl son
summer signing apparently mulllin playing
club real life fifa
didnt think anyone expected win year goal stabilize league season two pushing probably pick investor two league one really difficult decision try spend bolster squad become championship mainstay risking big wage bill get relegated spend conservatively fight stay badly impacted relegation
think felt would solidly mid table league 1 theyd struggle squad honestly midstrong league 1 squad good ageing player season everything clicked beat expectation concern championship step theyll need cycle lot player definitely impact continuity finger crossed survive championship would surprised even approach playoff tbh would love wrong
wrexham cl champ 3 year
absolute scene vardy help wrexham get promoted prem leceister stay
everyone calling son announced leaving leicester
didnt announce retirement safe say hell keep playing
wouldnt get great odds really popular prediction
bet whether luton stay beating today lol

inspirational victory wrexham incredible former premier league champion story really netflix series

womens club investment stadium academy development there lot angle im smart enough know
solid mid table championhsip side year dont think theyll make pl unless club sold welcome wrexham cant last forever unless something happening club american fan lose interest
hire rooney manager sign vardy make wife sit next every week

get promoted im fully believing live simulation somebody playing football manager save
realistically mean possible rob ryan bring third wealthy owner dont think money get promotioncaliber team put together said sponsorship money kind nutty
two season away champion league
scene get promoted win premier league next season
chance hell without investment 30 40 million happen assume someone running football manager save set everyones playerstats manually
definitely leg competition last two year season cash output pretty normal league 1 standard regardless money linked success absolute guarantee still perform pitch
mean like winning ucl bought blooddrenched russian oligarch spending couple billion pound player huh
well know sure start signing wonderkids kazakhstan panama
apparently similar revenue many midtable squad true edge fact player sign featured globally popular disney show bigger pull championship level player think people give credit player like anyone else want brush shoulder celebrity owner
every league get promoted pissed coz lose streaming viewership
dont think becomes much accessible watch u paramount plus showed wrexham game already let theyll get opportunity u certainly may show regularly tv england
got paramount league one game would watch championship game
ive never understood rich owner genuinely seem care club attend game arent extracting value club problem problematic faceless oil baron owner
absolutely least isnt country sportswashing
ya easily one ethical way accumulate wealth
know youre covering wonder whod 1 ethical couple actor
football fan biggest hypocrite going yeah wrexham spent lot money get see fan would take issue
id way happier less international attention meant wrexham buying way pyramid
whole plucky underdog spin people kept trying bring spent last 10 season league one wrexham 4 time revenue national league theyve far wealthier counterpart league two national league birmingham theyre probably richest league one side well theyve done impressive theyve done palatable way isnt underdog story lot people tried paint financially theyre championship side regardless three consecutive promotion impressive
normal lower league england football still semblance normality u lower league fan dont really consider top premier league playing sport u ever since officially detached football league 90
didnt class 92 try something like salford cahoot fucker ruined valencia everything achieved throwing money
wrexham town need help get
yeah plucky underdog narrative get wick id love owner admire job theyve done let stop bullshitting everyone like wasnt financial doping
celebrity owner dominating headline able dictate underdog story industry like sky sport thinking club premier league also wrexham impact footballing culture general lower league there big reason people ignoring reason birmingham spent 15m player league one arent getting much flack wrexham medium circus
difficult grasp people dont like millionaire buying club speedrunning football pyramid steroid dont give shit principle piss
whilst see point also source money engament seems actual community town plus come let real hate coming fact two owner north america assume lot people dont know reynolds canadian invading english football seems know marked people surface level football loving world yank
think people upset money man city chelsea came rather money
dont know youre joking wrong era toshacks swansea 80 got first division match old top four side even topped league time injury finished sixth relegated next two season toshack got sack
seriously hasnt salford able something similar owner ex man utd player go show good job people wrexham
money one thing smart use money entirely different thing im expert business side game mean look like seriously spent wisely every department could
documentary helped get interested lowernonleague football whole
lem guess youre mancunian
part difference spending think fact wrexham basically l1 level team l2
birmingham owner 100 multi billionaire lol
acting lol mean ryan part owner cell phone company also
sold gin company 800 million sold stake mint mobile 300 million
salary year like 10m per year total much lower end salary championship step league 1 massive
im sure people repeating bar birmingham big boy term spend
understood bitterness squeaking national league theyll quite moderate compared ownership wealth championship
think owning club sure way ensure wont either
isnt ryan
never count u hater well back hating ever
he bit failure previously level interesting see get next season
big club might loan player help build brand would surprised mikey moore spur get loaned championship next season
de bruyne going wrexham confirmed
see set narrative stall year ago havent bothered check still backed fact anymore want hate whats happened stuck criticism two year back
3rd highest wage bill tbf said parky obviously done well
dont think people extend sentiment city winning league 4 time example
one highest theyve got promoted underdog sorry next season may
theyll surely turn outside investment thats thing get tricky need money stay way wish best great ride football fan paul mullen ollie palmer beloved player gone next year thats price rapid rise
revenue already bigger championship average thoughhttpswwwbbccomsportfootballarticlesce92zk757vlotextwrexhams20revenue20is20staggering202d20but20not20surprisingtextthe20annual20turnover20has20explodedfor20a20league20two20side continue growing like theyll revenue closer 40 million next year almost double average championship
turn income theyre pretty well thanks amazon show
perspective stoke earned billionaire routinely write ten million dollar worth debt still consistently place lower middle section championship table
sponsorship sky rocket
big difference sunderland wrexham though wrexham punching weight first time reliant ever owner funding whereas sunderland getting double crowd wrexham league one biggest attendance championship theyre also competing team far richer owner pl parachute money
huddersfield arent championship tho
massive step make mistake
player like alex pritchard patrick robert jack clarke ross stewart pre injury prepared promotion young player would develop like dennis cirkin trai hume bought way back league one managed build fantastic signing like dan ballard arsenal amad diallo probably top three championship player time probably technicallyability wise best
mate went sunderland ipswich literally back back promotion league one prem forget lmfao
im sure need 9 10 turnover theyll need big infusion cash number signing ive seen bottom championship wrexham look quite bit better even current form
chance crazy relying 38 year old striker work league 1 2 championshiphe end heading usa
league 1 squad nll2l1 first time average quality without massive upgrade
thats phil parkinson recruitment strategy let stay comfortably next season wont get wrexham near playoff
vardy incoming lol
apparently goal 5 year championship year schedule
dont think anything conservatively american way
think would happy stay mid bottom mid championship year honestly dont think struggle maintain championship
screw wrong though
there absolutely way theyll get promoted
luton need stay win stoke derby play eachother luton win jump one
funny thing wont find boro fan right actually want u promoted
thats disgusting stat scoring since november grandfather could score least 1 goal he dead 12 year
lived preston july last year mood around much solid midtable club relegation candidate promotion material either wont either theyre currently 1 point away relegation zone 1 game go
missing obvious murder love triangle angle
good actual football fan boring people mostly watch show feel good factor wrexhams fairytale story
womens team already hit top unless move english pyramid nowhere go
check former player new clubslife
100 would love see investment womens club made incredibly interesting viewing
yes kinda reached ceiling american plastic fan get bored 3 4 season without promotion could try deep cup run tho
fully agree also show wasnt made fan english football believability
survive relegation win cup final get fairytale ending way seems believable one thing didnt want show got relegated eventually competing title get back s1 ted clueless relegated surviving support player compete league like man city major jump shark moment show never earned
pretty wild last 3 season promoted 3 time
last three year theyve gone league
cant even football manager must editor enabled
tom sim somehow doesnt help lincoln city
brought billionaire family season attracting billionaire ever increasing evaluation goal
tbf couldve said ipswich one right mind automatic promotion candidate last season
champion league season go
remindme april 2026
theyre getting point money alone wont enough though weve seen many team splash promising player still struggle hope make though really like rob
like mansa musa
dazn canada national league package cost 3 time much per month base package includes every pl match cant imagine anyone buying disney circus long gone
took note dont watch league 1 bet ill catch v leicester least
believe play espn
could jealousy could dislike thing related america think lot come fact theyre high profile owner fan cant put head sand pretend money doesnt determine everything sport
people dont like advantage fund club lower league way around wouldnt problem
right owner go good got nerve nerve many others follow lower league football entitlement new fan im trying gatekeep football stuff youd see online showed complete lack understanding lower league english football new fan mostly yank really entitled naive attitude acted like whole league bowing marvelling wrexham rest u npc wrexhams great noble main story make sense assume thats tv show portrays thingsi havent watched get grating load people never even set foot english football ground telling fan team feel acting surprised arent cheering celebrating acting like grateful feel blessed mighty wrexham coming tiny little town see get annoying right glad got promoted last year whole circus went away honest
philadelphia sportswashing
fan owned club maybe local businessmen putting money back community yeah slightly covering
salford city also rich owner gas owned two men kuwait im sure also millionares
lower league club owned rich dude owner arent celebrity b team arent well known prem team
semblance normality there always story horrible owner club going administration even defunct stadium left crumble finally somebody go invests team actual local fan rebuilds stadium manages success people hating
lower league england full case shit owner invested ton money team completely fail dont want invest trying sell
speaking nonleague rich owner league twoone
think youll find city need help get
football sport point try win team getting new owner actually invest club smartly push football pyramid definitively bad thing liking principle tornfaced muh tradition nonsense idea club settle unless progress certain acceptable way whatever fuck people think stubborn stupid nonsense end jealousy absolutely noone would complain happening club someone else
source money absolutely come youre right deadpool guy always sunny obviously much better owner sheikh russian oligarch sovereign wealth fund saudi arabia actually really like reynolds mcelhenney pleased see raising profile sport north america cant help feel id little pissed one national league lower league two team way competing wrexham famous people decided pick latest project
saudi russian oligarch one thing nothing morally abject profiting ryan reynolds film career
thats fair point criticism see experience people complain club buying success sport washing side thing come noble justification decrying blood money easier appearing jealous interpretation though im likely entirely wrong
wrexham werent sleeping giant sleeping big person one club city huge passionate local fan base
tbf salford 8th tier took much lower capacity ground dont ryan reynolds pull
ill one better dont even know mancunian mean
look incoming transfer 202324 v 202425 definitely spent way year last year wrexham still much higher transfer spend year club though closer amount spent team promoted championship last year rather fellow l2 l1 promoted team however still necessarily richest club l1
full number right he part time owner got way less
oh thought still fully owned gin interesting
hmm thats bottom 5 championship club championship 50m salary
l2 season bet 152x season
money yes difference richness owner richness club wrexhams owner werent among richest league one however set wrexham way club revenue money ryan rob give club make one richest leagueone
worth 350 millionhttpswwwcelebritynetworthcomrichestcelebritiesactorsryanreynoldsnetworth
get resource team dont difference resource used ryan rob building sponsor club actually invest team much different city style pumping money care building club sustainable way sure disney money help 90 rich owner would running away profit actually trying great even great see banner flying local brand meta jersey still stick club root power
mean sure like arent dozen team league 1 resource difference wrexham owner actually want team succeed bring revenue typical league 1 team use squad barnsley owner worth 91b isnt money
theyll able get plenty rich people would pay seen friend ryan rob
mullin willing accept back role still stay enough quality championship back squad player
oh theyll definitely selling 49 team
two good enough championship
would good time rob ryan end documentary cash fuck
wouldnt shock spent last three year lining already
l2 full year actual billionaire came 15 stayed hand
yeah assume theyll struggle wont financially remove parachute payment suspect theyll pushing top championship next season probably kit deal bigger prem

yeah dont actually think theyll make playoff mid table dint dreadful ownership standard basically everyone blackburn promoted side hopefully survive season
wonder soon surviveestablish theyll want get bigger gate surely theyll rebuild theyll need investment willing tied theyre still equivalent hipster overpriced burger place two crazy guy dream
neithers rotherham
step isnt massive one trying get promoted championship massive step
definitely people also said thing league one even league two iirc
enough team done back back promotion suggest anything real struggle getting league one look team like leeds wednesday struggled age
thinking current championship team forgot lol
fight survival idk maybe 9 10 overshooting definately least half
dont think thats true think theyve always squad 1 2x l1 player lee mullin dont think national league squad l1 one yr seems mullin didnt even play championship standard guy already anyways yea need upgrade think aim stay next season
absolutely didnt l1 squad nl hardly player still around probably l1 squad l2 good one signing year smith dobson rathbone james etc essential wrexham top l1 team continuing development young player like cleworth okonkwo would struggled finish tophalf team last season
source mullin sky sport game
championship super tight look relegation scrap right last matchday cardiff relegated theyre still 5 point line easy game team bigger budget legitimate pl quality player saying wont stay next year easy isnt word id use describe
mate ownership fucking diabolical leicester vardy needsto prem
agree said year well sport fucking weird
like way leicester win league never know
remindme 365 day
swear said league 2
weve scored away ive seen goal home forever think ive seen goal childrens team coach year
thats think whole idea mid table club dumb people predicting leicester get europe 2223 except got relegated similarly brentford went newly promoted amazing mid season one established mid table season max
hard tie continuation feel good factor get youre saying success feel good
youre right theyre 3 season deep theyre basically wrexham supporter
amount promotion possible last 3 season 3 advancement
also promoted two season row season making three row wild
promoted thrice thrice season thrice
actually need save scum lot
ranked around 5th favourite promotion absolutely load people promotion candidate pretty much every prediction table saw play offs better
galactic league alpha centauri fc
lyrically pack heat pack tape gun
thanks brother
dont think thats true anymore think paramount bought efl right u year
awww hell yeah already watch la liga didnt know thanks
definitely jealousy fan club stuck wilderness got cash exposure wrexham got wouldnt complaining dont hear many manchester city chelsea fan grumbling success got brought wealthy owner
got usl team town core supporter generally work home yuppie moved vibe cringe annoying supporter worst
yes theyre wildly disliked team league dont understand point wrexham done impressive im arguing take money theyve done rich club struggled doesnt mean theyre underdog
forgot c owner egotistical think know better football professional stick finger every little decision rob ryan hired pro stay day day dont need football stoke ego prove thats acting career done
jealousy everyone want big bank roll takeover club
experience people complain club buying success strange argument though entire football pyramid team best one better player usually due money
holy shit haha
bad spot sell company hundred million keep getting paid imageendorsements lol
im sure sustainable right word rob ryan left obviously lot sponsor revenue would disappear theyre saddling club debt seems like theyd leave club terrible position realistically probably wouldnt survive championship without rob ryan owner
finance wrexham afc doesnt actually get money disney well little licensing logo disney ryan rob individually making money disney series get club eye get sponsor extra kit sale time also give rob ryan credit seem actually care city kept club old kit sponsor well market rate recently bought brewery town help grow really fair play lot better qatari investment fund buy team
barnsleys owner run club massive loss ambition happens everyone 3 club get promoted
also brought quite celebs lafc ownership group game wouldnt shocked became something
already mate brought syracuse billionaire season
im sure friend rich billionaire level rich itll take level championship club need hollywood celebrity chip
he even l1 quality chance play championship
he making bench league 1
think need quickly shift career want connected wrexham try get managementmediatrainer position want capitalize fame pundit wale
yes revenue figure 20242025 obviously yet
great show there drama pitch anymore content come squad fan there many time keep telling story dont see l1 season much better maybe next year theyll struggle championship end signing lot new player meaning fresh story
give year everything disney
everything plex
stable owner go long way day sadly owner willing fund club probably enough survival efl
100 way go theyre already making revenue higher like preston millwall others realistically id imagine struggle break top 2 relatively quickly think theyll get playoff season next
interesting see attendance cap well tourist arent going fill stadium every week id guess around 20000 natural cap championship
birmingham promoted l1 gallop dont doubt youll least mid table next year big gap club
youd crazy say gap nl promoted side l2 big promoted side last decade finished top half l2
actually lot people familiar lower league football saying wrexhamnotts county run national league wrexham got promoted national league would confident getting promoted following year league 2 isnt much difference one fan documentary say well
ipswich first team decade rare team expremier leaguetop tier team far bigger attendance
example struggling get league one wouldve promoted first time asking point deduction despite edge going business promoted third year
dont agree want aim 1517th need 4 5 mostly defender midfielder forget next season oxford owl derby portsmouth luton qpr probably stoke competing championship arent great atm wrexham isnt far behind
top owner way nice confrontational thrusted role dad died lot less ruthless vichai let john rudkin director football way long leash rudkin certified moron make move idiot would make giving contract enormous weekly wage guy underperformed pushing cooper unproven rvn beefing kasper schmeichel vardy point sure done rudkin got ta go dude damage club day
palace would beg differ since promotion theyve 10th15th every season
basically everyone outside big 6 one bad year away relegation even club look like theyre flying brighton bournemouth etc happened leicester happened southampton itll happen said united chelsea spur shown recent year might getting stage even true big 6 anymore
everton entered chat
surprisingly actually 100 success rate promotion last 3 season
went went went
really dont
despite aim justify dynasty exist football league called big club iex big six pl deserve success try whitewash historical success kind heritage sorry arsenal united spur whatever fan really hated roman buying chelsea allegation past way earned money fact made chelsea powerhouse took club place nearly two decade reddit thing people seriously hate sportwashing regular fan would choose take newcastle fan approach celebrate let say billionaire money state funded would use sportwash native country make newest powerhouse english football
mean yes mean financed massive ownership injection like birmingham leicester etc however level
dont think get money straight disney feel like money rob ryan get one popular disney show certainly helping cover wrexhams loss indirect way curious broadcaster material one direct interest team crazy takeover ad banner gatorade united airline tik tok followed local trailer company lol think people surprised much money available next level large corporate interest success think end pretty successful likely additional partner rob ryan maintain control
almost every football club run loss look premier league 4 team made profit last year ontop likely break even year financially also would bet almost every league 1 team running close massive loss want rub face wrexham lost 27m 2024 barnsley lost 28m whats point
wrexham would set sort partnership ml young talent come play championship winwin everyone good deal u could probably get federation play wage see get big manager clout someone like jesse marsh build program edit clarify dont think player america anywhere else world able push team premier league long process talking forming partnership ml talent part youth setup exchange promoting team wrexhams benefit financial aspect player
tbf lot bench player championship arent championship quality even start game whatever reason
havent watched wrexham much year case finding level league 2 falling due age fitness something else
assumed injured
think playoff big ask player carried conference aging decent lowermid table easily need rebuilding get playoff get recruitment right recruitment isnt easy youre actually financial parity competition
u im referring even ipswich matter newly promoted side stay least first season generally beyond well unless specific circumstance wouldve screwed anyone 2324 promoted side oxford united safe 17th portsmouth 16th derby county look likely stay well 2223 promoted side sheffield wednesday plymouth stayed even putting aside ipswich sheff wed midtable side season reason plymouth going back decided hire rooney 2122 promoted side sunderland went straight playoff remain around rotherham stayed went year wigan got screwed corrupt owner 2021 promoted side blackpool stayed fine year struggled next hull stayed around playoff ownership decided idiot although peterborough come short
yeah there difference top nl bottom l2 say fan team gone two lot huge bottleneck top non league
wasnt one saying lol regardless people absolutely saying league one year
mean think going consider much marketable already marketable wrexham became championship streamed espn u think theyll lot eye ab able improve revenue compete
ipswich technically expl side long time also attendance league 1 promotion season averaged 26k 28k championship one think youre massively underestimating ipswich
15 point give fuck
isnt exactly im saying good addition probably avoid relegation comfortably mid table higher need replace entire xi basically
defense top he busy trying rebuild king power revenue flow insane damage covid dropped almost 80 first year covid climbed back around 60 peak
4049 point believe
everton near european place ancelotti threat relegation past two season
wild stat many people noticed three three promotion last three season
went like house like matt damon narsian like bruce willis armageddon
unless youre using sort cheesy throwin corner tactic really
revenuewages ratio along absolute revenue whats relevant barsnleys billionaire owner also account youre referencing wrexhams financial year national leagueleague two
young talent good enough make impression championship would good enough one best player ml sure would work
real dumb
wrexham id sign mbappe haaland imo
hilarious take never mind youngster wouldnt even get work permit
mourinho heard first
wont fire parky unless go next season thats maybe cause also hate hoofball guy done wonder wrexham far
work permit
championship marsch
shouldnt 3rd choice team play 1 striker 4th choice team play 2 striker he mile someone like billy sharp age
probably bit everything he always played league 2 whole career people seem forget he around never made l1 despite top l2 side fact dropped national league flat track bully made people overestimate ceiling
pretty competent far resource seem might even investment championship volatile enough think could probably manage 24 year especially get substantial additional investment
team didnt stay long whatever reason
yeah looking last three season promoted team even beyond wrexham stockport youve got notts county guaranteed playoff league two even outside hope automatic promotion grimsby chesterfield could make playoff bromley top half
improve revenue even doubt theyre top 6 revenue youve got parachute payment team triple attendance wrexham get
stadium big enough seems like match day revenue would probably biggest factor success lower league matter much someone sponsor tends make million lost hypothetically match day money
didnt mean team ipswich meant team wrexham wrexham diferent previous team
also spent massive money league one set immediately challenge similar vibe another side going season
oh doubt big c factor top shown rudkin door first time went keeping idiot hack job relegation malpractice much bigger warning sign relegation
ok thats little insane wtf lol
true adding also important note finished outside promotion zone last three season another great stat show rising club
respectfully skill issue
loan loan loan loan good free agent signing
love people think ml better championship remember seeing somewhere championship like 7th 8th best league world
qpr play lone striker weve still used something like 56 different striker season due injury tight schedule
point expansion league basically professional become league 3 get another promotion spot way mean nonleague remains regional
kit sponsorship need renewed summer interesting already brand sponsor would think value would keep skyrocketing u also going recession sponsorship money come united hp want spend even
ah would make lot sense
take 4 promotion subtract one thats many promotion wrexham last three year
sure guess getting consecutive promotion way prem isnt something people play fm
yeah think last season 1 semiprofessional team definitely make sense
promotion im hearing possibly might least last season
generally surprised whenever fm youtubers non league prem series get stuck single season championship generally manage back back back back back vnl n pl

he basically war veteran team 22 year old lmao
thats generation young player 2003 2007 barclays day good enough play old enough get criticized
lucas vazquez exists mate
thats harsh raphinha
doesnt disprove point though forward standout last year
doesnt negate fact
isnt common last 15 winner 2 attacking midfielders 1 centre back 1 central midfielder could happen shouldnt get hope
wasnt standout trophywinning attacker though compare raphinhas season vini last year still think pedri get though
vitinhas great kinda point dembele get pr psg like raphinha get barca midfielders deserve lot respect
learned something new today thanks
brain madridball
also distance nearest player pressing
barca academy unfair lol
quick 12
he 22 feel like he 26 already thats long he around

let leave best midfielder world wide open fantastic gameplan
truly iniesta regen plus xavi
best world combine
cant even see bellingham back angle mf stayed planted midfield
absolute textbook
beautiful goal
see alternate angle tchouameni tackle olmo looked like clear red
picking pas fantastic weight sublime gave pedri time stroll hit clean whistle beautiful
iniesta 20
kounde also deserved lamine prop ferran ran like possessed maybe hell raise game big one end season

defence dragged everyone mother
pedri starting attack
try roll sunday league pitch hope best
help grass fresh 1st game
wha fucking strike man see sheer pace even slowed replay outstanding
know right saw bus people around saying im perv
gave ball away decided stand hand head
people coming dont think play four midfielder bellingham advanced one attack midfield tchouameni ceballos tracked run
got mogged bellingham today
barcelona win ucl hopefully pull third treble many player would worthy pedri raphinha yamal lewy slightly lesser extent verge repeat 3 finalist messi iniesta xavi team
salah dead body
bit busquets
confirmation bias work
mean definitely making use lol rely much
least he ucl player never get say
come look trophy room one average season wasting already soo much player ever think
wasted 3 league title 2 cl 2 club wcs 2 super cup lmao
busy deeply sighing getting obvious pas intercepted
lmao somehow accurate
im sure youll make turf look like green glass mate ive faith
would definitely explain looked immaculate almost like artificial turf time
age ago plenty time track back given pedri nowhere near bloody camera frame yamal dragging defender
see suppose complicated anyone team would saw pedri make run far away single player trailing abit confusing
thing jude whine
goal started bellingham giveaway pedri long ball bellingham watching rather pressuring pedri goal run bellingham failed track assume comment purely trolling play sum much better pedri bellingham
wouldnt say lewa yamal deserve consistent enough think pedri get raphinha
salah definitely winning day team win ucl
thats insane take
even close lol barca multiple people top 3 top 5 position one undisputed though salah v lamal kvara pedri v vitinha v barella kounde v hakimi raphinha v dembele v vinicus lewa v haaland
trying tell dont know ive watching english prem since 96 im quite certain know im talking
specific youre wrong mean teammate helped defense engine would still rock well final minute might help link attacking sub
make sure camera see frustrated perfect real madrid player
yeah thats point ceballos pitch made back bellingham even picture
enough defender stop goal many defender got sucked yamal bellingham tracking back way summing duel lmao completely utterly delusional jude got better slightly 1st half despite madrid woeful ran ring around winning ball least 4 different occassions 2nd assume comment purely trolling anyone actually watched game could clearly see much better bellingham pedri
nah lewandowski deserves he contention ucl top scorer also running away la liga pichichi may underperformed number dont lie
im beginning lean pedri well honest im
insane throw lamal doesnt deserve convo kid still 17 cubarsi mind blowingly good age
yeah support hed even effective sure

he ridiculously good consider he 18 get even crazier
really ability focused age damn near every time whenever play flick high line well incredible
iniesta hairline dont lie comeback soon marc
made u go 10 insane tackle
ive never seen center back good young age maybe people old enough seen young maldini weigh personally ive never seen anything like
he basically midfielder playing cb point absolutely mad aerial game genuinely absurd passing range ability pull
he accurate passing defender brickwall withstood firing many time stood way worldclass player like vini mbappe like lamine get limelight cubarsi real deal level would say he defender doesnt get level attention edit cynically selfishly hope stay least stardom grows much slower lamine good barca keep cost
unbelievable performance today
cubarsi genuinely generational talent amount ball tackeld tonight fucking insane
future captain
dont remember player one best cbs world 18 amazing
guy looked liked prime pique except he 18mental mental talent
kid make happy man
casado lovely lmaohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyfhz1zgib5k
legitimate claim motm trophy remember he basically age lamine yamal ridiculous position
star cb one best team europe 18 outrageous yamal
counter terrorist win
dear
potential barças maldini
kinda look like carlos alcaraz guy
bigger talent lamine
good happy new year
spanish nt potential incredible pairing cubarsi ascensio latter hasnt seen much game time yet whenever watch seems rock solid
scary young team rule next 10 year healthy scary scary stuff
performance also consistent never drop 710
really got teenager nailed starter defence one best team world guy look like absolute veteran going best striker world kane mbappe vini lautaro next anulo cubaressi
literal teenager even araujo hasnt completely indoctrinated flick system
midfield beyond stacked come back pedri frenkie olmo gavi fermin casado bernal torre
also saved u many time extra time insane interception
maldini basically one come mind played fullback young age cubarsi good track become goat cb way way way early even think best luck great player great kid never dirty moment
know lot people wont agree marquinhos ridiculous young know chosing psg put people mind he great since 18
de ligt first season ajax easily thats also need see continue level couple year burned much buying hype early
quite level starting barca saliba arguably best cb ligue 1 19
he proper proper defender way intercept pass insane
la masia genetic lab hmm merge dna pique busquets one player
according capology cubarsi already making lamine though
itll probably cubarsihuijsen tbh he stylistically perfect partner cubarsi
la masia saved guy hard honestly crazy bad money club last 10 year
one got multiple
anulo cubaressi even mean lol
araujo bad ball need learn pas martinez curbasi hell good doesnt need bad pass focus he actually good shuttinf attacker
bro dont forget quim junyet flick headache deal fernandez cousin time
casado de jong
remember pissed psg snagged rom instead barca
de ligt 19 ajax ucl run though 17 making appearance top level 18 played cl qualifier made first proper cl appearance 19 cubarsi performing well best attacker world since 17
cubarsi adult contract lamine yet soon enough lamines wage surely blow past cubarsis
cant believe blanked either way spain fucking set
huijsen actually impressed much netherlands took boo usual dirty dutch play like champ played extremely solidly
cant believe arent race sign especially araujo leaf sign thats entire back four set least next decade
tebas currently looking banning barca promoting youth player
really regens messi pique iniesta team lol
academy less fucking bonkers
thats thing cubarsi inigo elite distribution reading offside line absorbing pressure funny thing one 33 others 18
hard learn pas sideways back issue barca one fewer outlet opponent know expect take advantage lack strength defending teammate dont total mantoman dominance higher chance recoverability opponent break past good variety hand
gon na hard cause pedri frenkie partnership elite 6 month ago id 100 agreed good problem lol
thats gon na difficult next season flick prefer bernal casado earlier season chance he genuinely better casado
flick disagrees
good flick rest world eye frenkie benched casado
nailed starter 17 played euro cup final 17 overall captain 18 comparison definitely
quite right de ligt captain 18
wait bernal come back lmao im excited back next season terrible injury
pretty different player pique imo doesnt physicality strength pique he also 18 even fully grown man yet he also probably good passer pique penchant goalscoring 18 much better temper decision making iq onball skill especially positioning pique age skill pique maybe ever thinking pique playing flick scheme make shiver hed constantly get caught position faster striker would one fail offside trap often anyone defensive side think pau might also faster pique
araujo moving summer right
pretty sure psg last year made dumb tackle instead pressing hard cut outlet forced making poor pass one pass lead counter attack dumb shit got sent
yeah barca fan going throught many shitty year make time lot sweet
frenkie liability overwhelmed though best position koeman run linkup play imho he cut current one although forced due injury
overall ive seen believe he yamal cubarsi level talent
flick say say trust flick life
keep promoting guy friend like get paid come back sign starter no9 replace lewa due age inevitable moving next 2 season maybe leftright back help rotation barca good next season well
good passer mate best attribute imo watching week week passing he able pas ball line ease look routine thats blew away first broke last season
think plan extended season sure end he lost starting place
probably although think might stay another season since proper preseason actually help integrate system ball playing issue massive game like yesterday great
dest depay nico abde mingueza starting turnaround
flick preferred frenkie casado long got injured though
youre mistaken forced due injury already benched casado casados injury he better
fucking love flick nurse player back team worried gavi might end returning damn today blowed mind shift man well
might watched pique prime legit playmaker back also said probably im saying pique wash think pique prime edge current version pau passer shouldnt controversial
depends improve passing great
gavi getting lot disrespect lately think pedris fault he good bar heaven gavi genius there reason golden boy broke early
watched pique entire barca career love man death pique better sending lofted long ball top curbasi spraying ball wide curbasis ability split midfield break press inch perfect middle ground incredible watch week take risk pique aspect passing pique opinion definitely better ball foot carrying ball forward
injury playing consistently getting better carrying passing think need rhythm preseason drill spot consistent rotation martinez getting younger consistently need rest

999th minute man rm tv got add crazy injury time
worded way im certain association take extremely strong response rudiger im certain theyll take close look especially seeing frequently instigates overall real response say look forward firm 1 game suspension strongly worded announcement meanwhile jude vazquez red rescinded rmtv release genealogical investigation head ref 3 hour expose every transgression every ancestor doubt real ever behave way
soooo red vini literally exact thing vasquez
get talked enough bellingham antic character fallen good chunk season cursing ref making countless foul worthy tackle someone tasked captain piss poor antic someone brings age seeing cubarsi yamal younger jude
vini manages slip away huh
surprised vini wasnt sent
hear punishment going get typical slap wrist towards madrid
jude aggressive attitude respectful
club whole need punished rmtv played role player acted tonight disgrace
considering match ban depends ref write report would guess 1 match ban vazquez 23 match bellingham 510 match rüdiger
rudiger play season fucking joke psychically throwing stuff member ref team lengthy ban
without reaching
999 minute remontada
tbh bellingham capable controlling 870 minute ft red unfair
red vini vazquez
there sense entitlement madrid player player easily lose cool get dont want lose 3 time season biggest rival restrained teammate want physically assault referee absurd player need crash course learning control emotion
anyone actual knowledge rule could shed light say many game could suspended rudiger probably wont play rest season bellingham get couple game least right
ahh yes played 999 minute
one questioning ancelotti man seems given player licence whatever want
well surely rudiger getting lengthy ban right way worded tentative assault referee 12 30 game

fairness play 16 hour highlevel football lost wouldnt blame bellingham reaction hed going postal point
vinicius came onto pitch well thing vazquez wasnt sent oh yes he golden boy sending would mean florentino personally would make sure ref would never seen first division game absolute bunch wanker trying pressure ref week got every single decision favour end acting tremendous injustice befallen never team player dislikable special mention bellingham vinicius rudiger psychopath
999th minute thats impressive commitment waiting 16 hour hassle referee
vini lucky getting red
aint good blind see
half madrid team getting least 5 match ban
bellingham looking less less like potential hero england
week realised ever awful entitled club madrid
weak as bitch cf oooohhhh scaryyyy yell threaten harass ref deserves ultimo respecto
wild one booked throwing whilst obviously 3
thats ref intimidated idiotic hate compilation
wouldnt red reached
id mat game went long 999 min
999th minute throw number blue
real madrid absolute disgrace team absolute desecration 15 ucls ownersupported toxicity stand longer ironic considered best team time act unprofessional like smh
prematch pressconf gas lit fire pressconf didnt happen game would less controversial
proper scrappy doo hold back energy bellingham
real playschool fc bunch baby make man city seem likeable
real madrid must biggest cry baby club ever qq
mustve fallen asleep dont remember 999 minute let alone red card
he gon na start cry
999 minute play inter week disgrace
wonder placeholder postgame offence
999 minute still couldnt score
120 minues long time sevilla
thought 90 minute long time bernabeu
still didnt manage score ancelotti heard ten hag available
longer fergie time bufferoverflowtime
sound better read 999 terry crew voice
lmao first
hope whole thing extremely embarrassing shitty fuck perez board
know school ref friend forgot homework teacher forgot collect didnt rat show clear pattern bias lying
wearing band league must clause cant booked dissent given he biggest whiny bitch match match
didnt stray quite far onto pitch nonetheless fortunate maybe wearing bib helped look like belonged also vasquez two fist shake thats twice many
want play football duh
thats racist
want play football
cause black
bellingham spent much time complaining asking call rather getting playing game really petulant
he tendency dortmund already def gotten lot worsemore tho
former teammate talked bit selfabsorbed cunt sort expected ambitious footballer carried well pitch least
club like hive mind turn everyone go whiny entitled baby saw carvajal cussing ref well
two match arsenal really noticed dirty petulant get thing arent going way
assaulting innocent defenseless var monitor
always short temper remember lost chelsea dortmund instead shaking hand player went way go provoke cucurella pushing absolute reason also post match slam water bottle turf proceeds drag away camera equipment poor cameraman job filming player incredibly childish seems matured much since hindsight arsenal player last week act camera although nobody truly care extremely pr trained good looking average football consumer dont care antic demeanour remember anytime english match played summer name highlight even though poor tournament standard medium dont care long action good get overpraised link source footage httpsyoutubetgfjwvf0tpwfeatureshared
nothing new already unbearable dortmund moment wasnt going way english press kept glazing matter
he wanker
always terrible english fan shielded long time although think since moved madrid gotten 34x worse
real madrid organisation encourages behaviour constantly look rmtv barça flick hed never allow youngster get corrupted like
real madrid virus hehehe
jude diva coach medium always allowed im glad flick didnt instill barcas young player long ago piqué alba busquets used bitch whole match current team keep head play
gotten lot worse compared time u
season
well thats attitude modern day real madrid breed longer he worse get
real dna taken
going madrid mother fucker
happens play real ego big dortmund would say balanced surrounded people also complaining every little thing able express without facing consequence club
far know already like dortmund obviously spotlight
he petulant child crazy far player drop join madrid part entitled culture club
like dortmund aswell
always cunt know way around interview well therefore seems likeable
totally agree easy get caught especially youre young hope find maturity though doubt real place
dortmund squad glad see back bellingham reason
watching game v arsenal noticed much dirty cunt towards arsenal player im like thats national team teammate id pissed rice saka
cubarsi yamal everything going right tho theyre heaven age frustration
came real humble worked hard amazing amazing got head think he better everyone instead working hard expects doesnt come becomes whiny bitch maybe whiny bitch syndrome passed onto one season madrid
dele alli 20
literally thing vasquez motion even synced
ref dont wan na appear documentary
cuz hed cry racism
right wasnt right next vasquez pitch
already yellow
others probably dont think rudiger getting away one
probably miss one game 3rd division team next season
say thank jd vance bellingham
wanted throw even bigger chunk ice proper bully
according rule rudigers suspension go upto 30 match
3 month rudiger rfef follow precedent dani benitez given 3 month throwing water bottle ref
would take personally without bellingham league classico light work need intense fixture rudiger already playing injury guess
threw like little bitch
incredibly irritating season especially given player seem lose head every week mbappe trying break blancos leg jude cussing referee rudiger absolute menace week week half team showing winning mentality death row inmate there lot fix need made honestly unfortunate carlo finish tenure real trying babysit ego
rudiger 58 game others 13 game guess 1 game even though dont know bellingham said rudiger think make example throwing shit pretty unacceptable done season doubt
anything 4 match ban affect next year copa rudiger per referee act totally miss rest season laliga
former referee eduardo iturralde say cadena ser rüdiger suspension 412 game la liga vazquez bellingham 12 game copa next year since less severe
theyll probably miss 1 match thats honesty
sure hell felt like
madrid mentality theyve always like look someone like pepe prison half stuff saw arsenal ground carvajal confronting saka took penalty wouldnt surprised vini claim ref racist thats goto
id say 810 game minimum sure bellingham though least far know dont image aggressive referee madrid never know
maybe issue public apology forgiven dont want mini madridistas bully referee kid play ground anymore
still full kit ref might missed chaos since slightly less obvious
know he sleeping smile tonight
tonight one fan base cry loudly
definitely cant realistically imagine anything else
barca didnt score either kudos defense
999 minute definitely long time
hed miss every game lol cant happen one star player league guess
booking vini racist
cried racism without incident racism keep getting upvoted sub youre fucking racist say someone doesnt like vini wanted barca win
thats say
vinicius feed
carvajal prick shouldnt anywhere close pitch he squad
inside joke towards friend stand
remember one clip young barca player accidentally stepped flick seat dugout stare flick gave crazy
eh raphinia restrained versus betis getting aggressive flick ter stegen
big difference dele mental health problem going back childhood bellingham seems piss poor attitude bad work ethic
looked like theyre haka dance
ricardo de burgos bengoetxea welcome tape
didnt vini get red cry racism even lifelong barca fan disheartening see people mocking serious issue
fuck upvoted vini really cried racism wasnt racism havent seen whiny cunt even dont like much ive seen doesnt cry racism
people pathetic literally never done interesting many people make comment like whenever vini something dont like cant simply criticise behaviour denigrate real issue racism face clown lot
typical bayern fan racist
convinced anyone using line argument either obtuse purpose closeted racist vini ever cried racism without actual incident racism let answer never understand gotten card including red never blamed ref racism card dont see narrative keep popping
match tshirt bib though likely ref missed
idk might take account jude already got red dissent season
absolutely there smoking gun well water bottle there way anyone gloss one given real antic week leniancy encourage madrid likely force referee go strike
he going ball water bottle missed 1 game suspension
surely rudiger get least 3 game throwing stuff referee ridiculous weve already practically lost league whats one player
yeah might get 2 game suspension instead stern word
didnt wear suit
he wearing white relevant minimum
would fucking great see he prick
30 year would fair
considering season end 2 3 month break anyway 2030 match instead
babysitting correcting ego manager job
sure bellingham dont image restrained teammate let see happens
he def season nhl shit even get 50 game ban
4 thought 2
wouldnt surprised vini claim ref racist thats goto claimed racism without abused
yeah he happy result
im cry knew going lose
""
let calm lol referee probably missed himmaybe didnt say anything egregious vasquez joking like racism isnt cool
completely agreed really dislike vinireal complaint racism spain racist behaviour fan valid disappointing see people make excuse
youre fucking racist youre kinda proving point
vini actually pretty good recently complains genuinely bad decision whistle blown ht ft meanwhile bellingham getting mad stopping teammate mistake
well mean like pitch side interfering opposing team player mid match anythingoh wait
legit dad stare
forgot outburst weird fuck day massive complaining ref seem far away though since madridbarça neverending cycle theyll eventually go back
true mental health condition doesnt excuse poor conduct reason player get mental health assistance help cope issue even spot underlying problem acknowledging bad behaviour owning first step towards improvement mental health condition important someone control one speak behave struggle struggle fit society people struggling mental health condition dont need pity need way
seriously even dont like madrid racist sub defend anything said clubplayer hate
vini speaks racism required also yes happen frequently he also massive cunt who whiny bitch unlikeable general he gon na get trolled everything point 2
thing spain afaik recidivist probably get quite game
know people like jerk around say 1 game ban likely get deservetly least 23 month
suspension 4 carry another domestic competition case laliga
succumbed bullying fascist kid hopefully wont bullied anymore smile
yup take couple comment vini thread racist racism apologist come cave
always happens sub people blinded hatred actively choose see reason would rather act like illiterate buffoon dont clue racism effect
mock something suffered year never used shield stood spoken yamal well never cried racism blamed racism getting red card pointing proving point youre racist
vini actually pretty good recently watch clip cant say straight face tread lol
wasnt vini aggressive vasquez clip
sure yet completely unaware mean mental health condition
trivializing real issue racism game world large simply trolling
using real deep rooted issue directly affect vini many people mock simply trolling like playing issue making fun vini fighting
he gon na get trolled everything point 2 he gon na get trolled racist massive bellends refuse listen anyone calling action massive cunt people would dunking well mbappé would start calling racism reaction sub would exactly victim complex
ridiculous racism real serious issue something troll wouldnt surprise people simply think fight racism unjustified probably think deserves dont like attitude player absolutely ridiculous
r madrid probably appeal say mistake ref report 999min therefore null void
fascist dont even know word mean throw around like know he happy helped team win
shut alphabet baby
exactly arent even joke straight racism upvoted hundred thousand people fucking crazy
mildly impressive know happened dele
football sport line trolling trolling poor taste blurred condoning
thats clearly placeholder value meaning game complete incident occurred
maybe thats note game incident
im brown muslim living spain know fascism mean youll ever know shame
hated madrid game hated rudiger vazquez vini sideline people casually defending justifying racism mocking taking stand people closeted racist
people right pile embarrassing behaviour club several player also glaringly obvious people use opportunity claim absolutely outrageous thing zero merit state discussion never lower show many people moral posturing several issue
understand although might completely agree get point anyway looking reply one bozo seen people push narrative seriously like user another thread claiming issue call racism present obviously never reply
number people made comment like dirty player whiny cunt deserves racially abused truly disheartening see

kicked corner tchous goal didnt
agree bellingham brought tonight good job
player good sub starter maybe ancelotti see way
followed closely behind every madrid team ever
mourinho team definitely worse far violent pitch petty uncharismatic version mourinho weve seen
dont know man competition crazy high
write ref report say throwing object technical area without reaching maybe qb could try linebacker safety
rfef might well hand bansespecially club acted week
especially holding back like fucking untrained pitbull looking toddler
put long throw lol
feel bad ref imo biased towards madrid theyre still probably gon na rip apart
wait till find covering as croatian mobster court
saying
guler pretty chill also
valverde tchouameni rodrygo güler yeah general find hard keep supporting rudiger vinicius
couldnt resist blaming teammate teeing kounde
see ref trying hardest get lose
yeah raphinhas decisionmaking final ball werent quite tonight move
want take moment appreciate padre alemany
raphinha looked bit game nowi hope turn around desperately need
think everyone share blame key player longer producing great result see vini rodrigos lack goal past month defense constantly injured proper replacement fuck perez anything defense put several midfielders plug hole defense midfield lack creativity time let go modric strengthening midfield carlos gameplay becoming predictable keep playing favorit player hinder growth youngster tire veteran player anyway season gone time move
except flick ancelotti incredibly honourable classy rivalry
dont forget team getting mowed like fly second half
dont think people understand much raphinha get fucked lewandowski balde pretty much 2 player together lamine helped reach number ferran doesnt really know drag player away properly making focus martin complete non factor offensively give player freedom focus raphinha isnt type player dribble move actually pretty big issue 2 player take lot attention arent
injured

licking lip arent
regardless result opinion refereeing decision throughout game club support really hope la liga fa crop admonish club shit madrid buildup match future completely inexcusable behavior ridiculous gon na fly
thought main ref would one influenced bribed var official
rudiger vini others see replay
two possible explanation either truly victim mentality believe referee favour team instead opposite level delusion would tactic add extra pressure even though know ref already mostly side favour either way pathetic
wasnt first time put stuff ref using rmtv right game work add extra pressure ref make second guess decision v rm clearly worked tactic still somewhat backfired prwise ref aired dirty laundry publicly made throw tantrum
always always done historically think barca fan like absolutely despise playing people like classico love type trash behavior disgusting look forward never played white trash club would soon enough one toxic match ive ever witnessed got sick turn turtle equalizer today disgrace white trash take joy sport barca play know inferior happens every important derby
ref scared get wrong
perez honestly fan enable shit entitled cunt instead football player like rudiger vini club need major revamp ground
dont forget normally mbappe suspended 35 match got 1 difference maker today
three front runner team good problem guy
particularly impressed yamals defensive effort today even end
spirit ramos lingers making sure everyone continues break man press
running field garcia foul end crazy since vini dont think carded
created chance first 20 min second half rest team whole first
rudiger attempted actual assault ban even longr 10 game
balde ready soon already training might miss inter first leg though lewandowski im really sure personally think well lucky play ucl semi final
balde hopefully good go inter game lewy like 2nd leg
arda gulers corner almost feel like penalty lol dangerous every time holding breath
andaulsia flag
least get extra day rest theyre also running fume evidenced last 2 game
know thing dire courtois people looked one classiest player lately
barca fan avid jude hater terrific today second half truly outplayed pedri first time long assss time pedri lost ball lead several dangerous chance
murderer match

thats he always dortmund get lot less press attention real seems cocky entitled streak character hidden personal dortmund pr team drawing attention respectful moment tbh think fit real madrid player play need least bit cockiness succeed imo lends well clutch black magic moment plus marketable consistently perez clearly know
didnt shit u either two leg
he still playing well imo
mbappes behavior already worse well constant diving dirty foul crowding ref wasnt bad dirty club rot everyones brain
mean scandal strongly hinting referee corruption
mentality midget soon dont win easy blame ref accept go
theyre younger squad cunt

probably perez diva decision
choice lol madrid absolute class employer say something go along
dont see correlation he saying jude cunt youre correcting saying played good game
played really well midfield today
standing still hand head pedri initiate finish counter say otherwise
double modric guler sub show usual level wasnt anywhere near first 50min game

team struggled score wouldnt said particularly true look championship record career far burnleys defence season amazing theyve also outscored everyone except leeds bizarrely 13thplaced norwich similarly promoted bournemouth team outscored everyone except fulham arguably true promoted fulham team 7thtop scorer season even isnt really id call struggling score premier league record isnt great basically amount single full season charge strong favourite relegation fulham plus four game bournemouth bit meaningless id tend reserve judgement go

bad attacker try shoot 5 player passed
malding
spotify tell verdansk dave match lyric
yeah agree thats reason didnt concede situation attacking player middle got ahead defender seems beating pace guy possession put ball 20 square yard space teammate goal guy sprinting back admirable would irrelevant
get away blatant foul completely change outcome attack thats good defending though
promoting burnley defencefouled attacker who run actually beat dont watch burnley part reason defence good bit dark art element dont foul ball carrier second third player support since might behind ref line vision

oh dont actually remember tbh dont think broke goal scoring record though got close point record lad basically holiday run fell short meant league blackburn though worth
solid take dont know early season thought going overtake chair become best attacker well see thing go next season even manage keep marti
measure paper surely subjective
dont understand question maxime esteve obviously best cb world
there nothing relevant statement
think play style translate premier league time still remember kompany going man city opening day playing back brave
yeah sure also say celtic best attack world know know everyone else know isnt true
using logic sunday league team concedes 5 goal season best defence world right
consistently commits tactical foul halfway line stop promising attack fully develop
think significantly chance sure like dyche brought u playing solid football focus secure grinding positive result said believe dyche least dyche 2015 significantly versatile manager tough cant worse kompanys way
yeah obviously
hendo liverpool neither rarely ever something blatant usually opposition half dont let man turn get full stride attack pretty far developed open one pas left play im gon na say var would definitely intervene theyre daft clear didnt first youd get away thing blatant 58 game max
yellow card offence far var would never intervene shouldnt made tactical foul 100 right decision

var scared shitless today didnt want intervene forced
actually agree super happy barca tired player landing as simple contact called pen striker already lost balance lost ball 2 defender defender would get ball anyway contact automatically foul
even already lost balance who say wouldnt catch got illegally kicked foul there much
maybe right also right ref calling anything today long remember kick heel 100 call might wrong anyways visca barca
thats thought absolutely reason dive
think thought touch back enough clearly lol
hate thats thats football player choose flop rather try score
kept running tripped win penalty
probably yes
asencio hit back leg raphinha knee fall
touch leg behind knee dont think penalty wasnt dive either
didnt touch back foot
right knee litteraly hit raphinas left ankleyou clearly see first replay
cubarsi one pen one ferran would soft dive
asencio smack back make fall foot dont matter
yes contact lol open eye problem raphinha already going contact lol dived doesnt mean wasnt also contact
rudiger ferran couldnt clearer cry succesful bitch club
rudiger one though ceballos one though
close enough
world pen please guy protect ref fucker
penalti favor del
also avoided couple yellow red
one dani olmo almost olympic goal
one ball hit post 44 min
one cubarsi
cubarsi pull imagine
tchouameni scissor tackle olmo behind
rudiger kick leg hope help
kick lift leg textbook pen
kick leg
talk one cubarsi one ferran probably rapha kept running would trip asencio leg unlucky bad dive
raphinha penalty check clip
speakit dive
rudiger kick ankle
barca dna practiced diving perfection
right hand pushinghitting raphinha foulfym diving contact
raphinha going balondor isnt enough lmao
fundamentally agree idea make nonscoring foul box indirect free kick spot foul conversely dosgo penalty yellow card rather red card punishment actually fit crime
last one blatant dive lmfao
half people commenting think raphinha pen wont get anyone
think people thread talking two different incident lol raphinha incident others ferran one one clear one one clear dive
seeing replay agree already falling contact
dive actually impressed rather making call diver
clip youre thinking one clear penalty
think talking wrong penalty rudiger one contact
think go specsavers contact quite clear
clear dive second look slowmo ref correctly overturned gave yellow simulation
youre wrong thread ferran one
point actually discussion sub especially madrid game initially look like clear pen looking replay seems barely contact raphinha already falling
literally every single one ucl scummy call dipshit
taste medicine
still
old bro actually watched leg could see referee horrible side
yeah saw replay guess contact trigger fall
chill buddy youre still game commented seeing replay good luck next 30 min
idiot think 2324 season var overturned correctly even barca fan think thats penalty stop calling people stupid youre probably dumbest commenter ive seen

neutral look like dive
rudiger one
people dont read article commenting seriously expect watch gifs
lol commented wrong penalty get 50 upvotes saying something completely wrong
bayern fan always dickriding madrid
hand cubarsi torres 3
dude miss reference
cant blame people including thinking game penalty shout machine lol
lot people saw title think responding asensio rafinha incident another incident
correct there pressuring tactic dont think hed inclined give penalty begin
yes barcelona number 7 raphinha serious watch clip posted shit
ive waited 16 year
xd cry river know situation video ferrans leg swept overturned cuz never checked even commentator said shouldve checked
agree feel like really prevalent var check every micro contact
ah right thoguht implying pen even raphina never made contact
ooops sorry order post got
honestly weird af raphina seemed going even contact dont know action ferran wasnt checked tho
posted dont know still
ever tried plant foot kicked
fedes wasnt penalty rule changed handball youre using hand support body
he falling put hand break fall
penalty imo
brother one ferran raphinha dive
thats penalty dont want watch football anymore
oh go whine somewhere else one mistake corrected another
bro watch inigo mark rudiger corner would conceded 2 pen shirt pulling standard even second goal madrid watch inigo pull rudiger
think forgot add totally wrong
sure didnt like barca daddy spanking cl year
kane complained today ref like madrid expect
hand wasnt pen cubarsi one issue doesnt get called anywhere else weirdly torres one wild cause thats 100 pen
saw cubarsi one thought initially penalty replay show pulling call foul argue attacker affected holding ball close
true justice team never get benefit referee called real madrid barcelona referee always check everything var
suppose wouldnt craziest argument ive seen reddit mostly annoyed raphinha also var official reviewing cubarsi clothes torn box earlier
saw live thought stonewall pen replay showed realized really well timed dive funny thing didnt even need dive kept running wouldve sufficient contact asencio pen given
found also valverde hand couldnt find ala barca win im good
lmao sorry bro thought thread raphinha lol
show one frame planted foot kicked ill venmo 500 buck
dont see supporting weight hand fully extended doesnt even touch ground
ironically hand didnt even support fall ball hit colapses floor without arm supporting fall
fucking idiotic rule fall see point purposefully sliding tackle touch hand pen imo
ironically doesnt break fall arm though
bullshit one well calling tackle rudiger wishful thinking one soft penalty given cubarsi
maybe dont watch rudigers clear penalty
team get call havent stopped watching football
mistake would winning
literal minute raphinhas dive clear tripping ferrans well say youre watching game wan na yap make sense
shameless lmaooo
handball according rule since isnt supporting rule clear
yes understand wasnt even ground touched hand
thing hand wasnt pen nobody behind yamal would pen sure didnt even touch ground handball
holding literally stopping cubarsi scoring big difference least desereved var checking like ferran
scuffle two player
get pas one player us hand arm support body falling sliding handarm natural position support considered handball offense even ball touch valverde ground using arm support one fuming though
thats losing bet right true gambler mentality
started falling rudi even put foot grass cmon clear dive
sorry thats sounded like
he fucking falling youre mental think 3 pen
see youre saying neutral dont really mind decision obviously team id fuming regardless
cubarsi holding defender back work way
lmao literally pull shirt holding back he inch scoriing
yeah didnt see people telling handball wanted check thanks clarifying
lmaoooo sorry thought thread one raphinha
gambling problem tho lol
rudigers foot tangled w rudigers clumsiness ferrans fault
come mate never penalty cubarsi grabbing ceballos aswell
ferran added lot
biased opinion ive seen penalty less literally holding
could right could right see optic whole thing tho 5 second check 5 min raphinhas check go back match foul cubarsi box clearest penalty shout match wasnt even given second thought

imagine going ian wright people muppet
wrighty looking fashionable
problem eni shes bright
lol people asking wright forgive move one doesnt always need forgive wronged move
honestly agree ian
need accept apology completely wrong never fan dragging shit social medium rather behind closed door dont accept every apology people done womens game commentary broadcast men woman instead restricting
beyond biggest voice womens game ian gone way even pay surgeryrehab player who club havent done need accept apology there many people done fo womens game england uncle ian
ian done womens football punditry eni everywhere go stink shit maybe check bottom shoe
completely ootl backstory
anyone loved ian wright football like trying pop father christmas
cant fathom fact woman ever men game could suggest men shouldnt womens game woman man straight face
shes complaining wright take space womens football coverage there enough opportunity woman broadcaster pundit men game thing watch womens football bbc sky highlight show live coverage nearly entirely woman ian wright pretty often actually plus would argue normalizes men interest game show woman single ian wright say something wishy washy aware much youre womens game saying youre welcome want bigger job men game sympathetic position
think totally fair ian wanting accept apology time wanting move eni known better apology isnt going fix relationship hopefully situation end though
right stop normalising people saying purposely shit thing harm people accepting apologizing like nothing happened
disgraceful comment ian wright done much womens game must felt like kick gut
apology shit got halfway point shes right wrightys name brought fails done podcast acknowledge great work ian done womens football uplift woman get sense doesnt understand wrong happened one good point doesnt mean everything say okay
wright legend almost scoring goal per game entire career
shes terrible representative womens game hope shes tv good despite spiteful bitch shes also one worst pundit ive seen bar fucking low
hope saga end alukos punditry career firstly shes genuinely shite secondly shes damage reputation acceptance womens game helping grow point
someone treat ian like asshole literally nicest guy fuck sake
apologised facing sack understandable
yeah rightly shes fucking moron
shell probably call racist accepting apology
wrighty one genuine people football try bring others instead pulling ladder great he advocating level game without wanting fanfare he performative aluko honestly targeted one person doesnt agenda backfired massively
saddest thing probably considered friend
fucking love ian wright calm grounded voice mad football environment he proper good human
there two reason pick fight someone who universally liked know exactly play pr game stupidity b crass cynicism want medium attention even negative thats still valuable irrelevant
former england international aluko attracted headline criticism week comment made appearance bbc radio 4 woman hour appeared suggest itv colleague wright presence across womens football coverage risked blocking opportunity female broadcaster ive worked ian long time know think he brilliant broadcaster think he aware much he womens game think aware aluko said fact matter limited amount space available situation equal opportunity men game broadcaster coach womens game free thats case cant dominate men game way know used ian example asked thought wrong wright cover womens football replied dont know wrong think need conscious need make sure woman blocked pathway broadcasting womens game still new still growing there finite amount opportunity think men need aware aluko responded criticism comment taking social medium dismissing clickbait headline shared link full interview relevant section question
really muppet
accept would say apology forced make excuse short coming blaming others poor naming wright right disrespectful first time talked shit tbh kinda taint accusation england manager playing person holding back shes poor pundit woman
someone talent moral try take person detestable woman genuinely hope last anyone ever hears full time victim point finger everyone played gender race card repeatedly basically female joey barton
aluko ironically turning joey barton say controversial stupid thing stay relevant
good accepting apology
watch crouch 2 female commentator game yesterday thought past nonsense
wrightys top bloke seems like forgiving type accept apology speaks volume alukos character lack thereof
classy response he honest disappointment without dogging eni pushing want say piece move
simple httpsyoutubei745ajeq_b8siyh1ijpvnd426_zvq
constantly say ridiculous thing label anyone doesnt agree sexistracist male saying thing id say exact
get as wrighty shes mockery womens football cant hold candle pundit
nice one wrighty
scotland invented modern football
really dislike aluko shes horrible racist face slapped arse time spout nonsense terrible opinion play race sexist card called
go unc tell wholeheartedly support
nice still took time recognise part point privilege wish medium covered part headline instead ian wright reject aluko apology see sting bit seem good friendship said he done lot support
matching hulk text shirt super stylish

meet chat iron grown mess
woman pundit continue irrelevant unwatched forever
easy slag eni think understand everyone coming seeing female teammate get turned job men getting female game see thing happening itv trying grow womens game profit admittedly asking ian wright excellent move select female ex player nobody heard rating suffer ian wright simply trying help grow womens game could easily bigger job genuinely care
iit bunch brogressives taking alukos comment context
nice way keep medium gon na get headline way
honestly top gracious accept apology hardly need become grudge match side taken social medium barricade built edit see barricade built knew would
david beckham one doubt issue
ian wright actually done womens game im ootl
always find type situation childish understandable didnt like comment making video really want talk situation meet person
make even stranger logic shouldnt covering men game dont really care pundit long theyre good job surely there double standard
aluko would least somewhat valid point directed criticism almost every male pundit covering womens game apart wrighty he always championed womens football genuinely passionate started following arsenal womens team
chance may got ian wright joey barton mixed seem bit dense bless
irony dont think intended mean look really fucking thick say someone read original article quote sound like asked loaded question answered horribly shes notable stinker pundit wouldnt shock absence common sense caused latest problem read shed said dont think intending suggest wright literally blocked opportunity booking job given monopoly opportunity
thats like saying sky blue mate
he national treasure protected british museum
picked outfit made sure rolex matched shirt
qualified solicitor shell make victim throw joey bartons name
shes clearly smart opinion interesting look jill scott going great gun kelly cates total pro done fairly brutally name get door engage audience andnifnyuu cant youre gone
exactly forgive forget doesnt really work dont forget acknowledging apology doesnt mean accept suddenly dandy let guilty live guilt
two wrong dont make wright
cant understand aluko much narcissist decided come like see hurt face helped point career threw back face target ian wright well probably male footballer championed womens game ridiculous really hope eni aluko sacked debacle certainly privilege covering womens euro summer
need household name punditry broadcasting role whether ian wright carra henry christine sinclair alex morgan marta etc female household name fewer point time game grows shouldnt replacing ian wright female nobody heard woman game need big name grow able create female household name sport eventually fill role ostracizing support game send backwards farther goal eni need awareness know womens game critical point need gather support divide
also quite damning doesnt apology know comment misguided ignorant purposefully malicious
everything heard seen aluko well past day im afraid sth bottom shoe thats po
ian wright probably biggest voice woman game england eni aluko basically said presence popularity blocked woman getting position woman game basically attack probably biggest advocate woman game wright correct pleased comment
ein aluko chose pick fight supportive person womens football claimed unc ian blocking woman getting commentary gig womens football
ians huge proponent womens football especially england womens national team point take medium role womens football game eni aluko went bbc radio 4 complained ian blocking opportunity woman sport take job working pundit commentator womens football could otherwise going woman
somebody chose attack publicly regarding blocking female punditry opportunity even though he probably biggest champion womens game vocally publicly support shes always playing victim card saying men involved womens game since limited another random female player shared story club wasnt covering rehab cost ian privately pocket issued apology aka trying save face backlash received fair wrighty isnt accepting
podcast said there risk male pundit dominating female game wright pundit work womens football said there risk woman blocked sport easily get men game ignores good work wright done womens game
httpswwwbbccouksportfootballarticlescgkg8kjlp80o quite attack wrighty think quite thoughtful even dont fully agree interview bbc radio 4 woman hour aluko 38 say wright need aware much work womens game finite amount opportunity woman wright major advocate womens football regularly worked pundit especially covering lioness ive worked ian long time know think he brilliant broadcaster think he aware much he womens game think aware said aluko fact matter limited amount space available situation equal opportunity men game broadcaster coach womens game free thats case cant dominate men game way know used ian example asked think wrong wright cover womens football aluko added dont know wrong think need conscious need make sure woman blocked pathway broadcasting womens game still new still growing there finite amount opportunity think men need aware
fair prick gave lump coal one year know chore never forgave
could suggest men shouldnt womens game woman man straight face look history womens game one lifting woman keeping men banned woman playing half century might well try make like ian wright shouldnt female pundit commentator men game hardly like good pundit rio ferdinand prerequisite neither played men football noel gallagher
didnt lol
shes wondering make victim
bigot
ian lucky black situation
intimated working womens game frequently could costing opportunity female pundit
every right give opinion point raised he really focusing personal im interested hear take
someone make comment publicly youre well within right give response publicly
eni aluko make comment rude incorrect
brogressive lol thats new one
really though bit point made poorly showed shite judgement bringing someone well loved football community fails realise presence pundit zero talent meritocracy useless pundit gender andor race fuck shed better focusing improving rather calling bullshit reason isnt presenting match day
know personally feel go deeper public professional persona sometimes stuff like
yeah bit weird
maybe find easier accept apology stranger changed damaging view find accept apology someone know personally seemingly offended he probably hard place doesnt comment constantly asked want stop asked move
wrighty absolutley within right need accept apology isnt top name brought specifically negative light clearly passionate womens football also understands challenge womens game face even punditry wrighty supported womens football want continue supporting seed planted potentially regarding actually getting way thoughtless comment first time aluko dropped bomb like
based said conversation himhis management sense two privately good term feel said 100 disingenuous play baseless speculation said serious understand okay accepting social medium apology
eni aluko criticised ian publicy apologised got backlash ian absolutely need accept apology
definitely didnt doesnt address issue ian wright blocking woman becoming great broadcaster aluko wont say think
wondering redditors would make argument two black people racism youve managed incredible
even mean
probably male pundit actively publicly champion womens game every opportunity pundit nearly every england international game itv host podcast former england captain steph houghton weekly wsl going womens football actively want learn game help
reason started following arsenal womens team closely
would leaking braincells got mixed
dominates fashion game
hed egyptian italian irish indian greek
two thing true time 1 eni terrible pundit deeply unserious person 2 barton evil thug absolute low life
blame joey barton move
im sure id rush representing
bit icky comment tbh mate
shes clearly smart isnt wouldnt thread right
nieve petruziello stuntpegg deserves pundit pl wsl match
except people sociopathic arent really affected guilt much thats shaming ostracising exist rightly wrongly
even accept apology still think person stupid
forgive forget forgive never forget atleast
cu aint bright remember casually dropped colluded prop transfer fee folk like dont think thing like others helping past
shes shit job anyway always shes token woman broadcast blocking others getting shot job certainly doesnt get job good personality analysis fuck actually want listen get rid wont missed
woman hate men
shes clout actually help grow game
also woman commentarypundit team sends message segregation womens football separate completely men game one best thing womens game team game
janine beckie also great tsn whenever euro men woman come around womens game need heavily prioritize pundit insight skill theyve built player anything
lot comment bell end year people imagine wright heard thing none u producer behind camera staff well people womens game thought nah fuck shes known shit bag thing often nice stuff exposed double nice hear nice thing wright womens game without taking credit
absolute cheek shes constantly punditry men game shes thicker corned beef sandwich genuinely give impression somebody never watched football let alone play game
eni aluko basically said presence popularity blocked woman getting position woman game here interview relevant bit start 38 minute inhttpswwwbbccouksoundsplaym002b6w7 im quite sure agree characterisation comment quite honest shes one bringing name shes clearly acknowledging ian wright done womens game make wider point gender imbalance womens football including punditry management pointing important conscious scarce amount position pathway currently exist young game
youd think someone close would sit grifter dug grave
every right accept slap face
also ignores two thing less appetising 1 ian wright high profile anyone womens game brings exposure game result 2 top level men game higher level football top level womens game sense like championship player complaining ex pl pundit covering championship championship player cant dominate pl coverage disrespectful honestly someone like aluko great pundit less football experience least level cant argued superior seems argument men shouldnt allowed
doesnt sound half bad people making doesnt come malicious attacking wright
nothing thoughtful word normal feminist claptrap woman always victim man always oppressor everything 5050 really dont think feel strongly thousand qualified men wrighty might blocking job five ten woman usual argument come woman get job woman ridiculous argument ian wright thing demanding ian wright better person better advocate womens game
user replying never suggested shouldnt woman men game
yeah go men actively keeping ian earned right take medium role womens side football considering much staunch advocate
point obvious strong push include female pundit men game last 45 year least england almost every show sky sport bbc female pundit one example kate abdo kinda dishonest part claim comparable opportunity woman pundit men football intelligent
ah youve played mate

complete loser
know eni wrong ian one attack like teaching moment clearly still hurt
thats impossible challenge
name brought specifically negative light eni aluko mind
said 100 disingenuous play listened interview 38 minute inhttpswwwbbccouksoundsplaym002b6w7 doesnt strike play eni aluko isnt one bringing ian wright name make perfectly valid point lack opportunity womens game poorly framed
didnt say needed said big man accept know everyone would see generosity win
he saying white people would issue basically he trying make racism
he actually done anything grassroot funding coaching academy donated anything
one white black look human aspect wright class barton knobhead mixing possibility lmao
block opportunity hobo unkempt flourishing medium game lowlife fella wrighty
another job given woman smh repeat offender
female fashion game sadly
original iirc majority item bm english
people intellectually capable also total idiot come decisionmaking interacting people like lukaku fluently speak seven language seems make worst decision possible whenever come using language speak publicly
think shes dangeroustrouble deal causing hassle
dont know enough eni render opinion american deal lot grifter smart people say incredibly stupid shit make lot money texas senator zodiac killer ted cruz far worst example
mean tbh isnt really something need feel super guilty
fara williams exudes love football strong everyone hope find much joy anything nobody bat eye karen carney steph houghton general woman issue like eni would wish make
get job cause controversy controversy get attention
get impression said lack acceptance part say he supported helped behind closed door stuff backed someone turned around like bet im accepting apology either
shes good broadcaster either worst part
absolute cheek shes constantly punditry men game dont agree criticism wright obviously point exactly load opportunity men punditry men game limiting men opportunity woman get token spot men game wrongly think limited air time woman punditry football especially limited punditry womens football ians presence sphere taking spot away woman completely ignoring good ian done womens football champion criticismargument would valid picked man regularly appears womens football broadcast standing men game without proponent womens game person idea ian wright one deserving criticism
dont think separate two point tbh ian wright brought steer away whole conversation maybe talked generally wouldnt got much attention dont think would better point would remain men talking womens football large reason arsenal womens player ever said explicitly implicitly vik akers couldnt speak womens football would rightly considered mad much like aluko thats notwithstanding lot people dont like lot people attacking would people criticising wright womens euro
claim opportunity dominate male football punditry isnt charming look say jermaine jena everywhere he bland fuck he wrighty get opportunity even people dont like football know
gave listen find argument slightly incoherent recent womens tournament hardly men broadcast bar ian wright bit damned damned dont supporting womens game becomes dominating converse would showing lack support found comment bad fath
thought agreed position first read comment yesterday listened actually think dig deeper hole time go
important addition point 1 bring exposure high level enthusiasm whenever he covering lioness tell he actually big fan he money
shes suggesting wind back broadcasting he blocking female broadcaster definitely naturally read criticism
basically internet drama bad people make im also pretty sure specifically asked ian wright like threw name premier issue womens game right easy take context make seem like hate
shes gone though name brought interviewer initially aluko pointed fact there opportunity womens game still small important conscious effect man space like reckon even agrees point extent given explicitly mention men massively hampering womens game collective cant collective approach people involved arent selfaware
dont want revenge simply think right thing least make effort right historical injustice know like ian wright championing womens game
point obvious strong push include female pundit men game last 45 year least england thats great maledominated space opening woman celebrated shes pointing side coin football medium maledominated space womens football broadcasting subset maledominated space important conscious half wsls manager male none 92 plefls female surely there barrier somewhere making incredibly hard woman work men game way simply isnt men womens game punditry ahead regard like every male manager womens game taking space could go toward woman field punditry shes simply pointing important consideration come growth womens game there obvious answer reckon least keeping general imbalance removed one specific person mind important else make sure there equitable way woman succeed covering game
didnt know shed hired pr agency gregg wallace
specifically mention ian making point 4030 listened twice make sure
part valid genuine question
weird thing would thought issue gender bias might enough

feel free prove wrong ive never seen single instance targeted specifically comment race gender every criticism ive seen simply generally shite punditry making ridiculous statement
jill scott overlap well actually hilarious bad aluko first wave female pundit likely job set next 15 year making player needed shit constant say stupid shit decided go one loved pundit one former male footballer championed womens football uk
enjoy karen carney played birmingham give good analysis leaf dont think shes particularly personality doesnt try force one shes get asked question football answer question football give insight done
fuck care anything eni aluko say normally lol care ian wright need binned
let completely honest white would nowhere near telly
yeah spot reckon honestly thought hed try defend bit wave know like black footballer pundit uk know male pundit player much stick womens footballer get bloke hate specifically state reject apology like say there thoughtless remark someone clearly prone think must really wronged say
people always say worst part hypocrisy
wouldnt say jena best example considering lost lot work reported inappropriate behaviour necessarily bad presenter
karen carney seems alright men game shes good eluko isnt
know he big deal men football something female pundit could possibly achieve
bit damned damned dont supporting womens game becomes dominating converse would showing lack support thats kinda crux yeah need find way people work together benefit everyone like ian wright proposes mindful distribution effect like eni aluko mention got ta people open discourse figure really reckon medium made isnt particularly helping
yet demanding role based merit based sex based merit
club side get hyped arsenal womens team almost equally much men team man love football going quite possibly dumbest thing couldve said
way fix give position based merit female male none making 60 year favouring someone someone else based sex
realise interviewer saying im thinking ian wright yeah
reckon whole conscious space take idea come man involved womens football regard small game opportunity well there onesided barrier talking men managing wsl woman managing plefl perfectly salient point like obviously talk see actually agree explore disagreement book theyre perfectly legitimate viewpoint really
thats really good idea
thats really nice thing
know read story someone else linked really decent thing idea

whats merit
pure soul like ian wright championing game surely thats also taking revenge standard cant champion woman covering men game criticise good man covering womens game im criticising ian wright im simply pointing he making effort doesnt need make champion womens game every opportunity think right thing either trying make progress stuck past progress look like ian wright yes men actively working sexist attitude men inhibit
merit look like
yes interviewer brings ian wright asks eni question specifically ian regard men womens game eni reply specifically talking ian mean speaking plain english dont know else explain
feel like youre really conscious much ian wright done game specifically womens football agendabiases youre trying push space take absolute positive womens game wsl would better position without better opinion exclusively female involved remove male pundit male coach opportunity sake woman point make womens football best possibly meant give female exclusive opportunity ie participation award exclude men especially much experience positivity ian hope former misguided
thanks reply think reasonable point make dont agree ignore pretty important fact womens game uk financially propped men game im saying bad thing men participating area womens game issue pretty hypocritical artificial sponsorship womens football also creates question around meritocracy product nowhere near level quality lower league men football receives proportional level coverage argument made aluko smack cake eating lack female manager men football interesting one hopefully floodgate open someone make first breakthrough however biggest part backlash really alukos performance pundit lack charisma poor speaker struggle articulate real insight irrespective gender isnt well liked due lack ability fan really dont want hear comment woman held back obviously little talent clearly benefited others male female far deserving

normal former player team feature suppose weve kind got inverse womens game half wsls manager men despite never played womens game medium punditry fundamentally structured around men charge well thats ultimately whole meritocracy argument doesnt pas muster cant meritocracy there massive inequity opportunity like dunno big picture reckon shes making point least heard explored regardless whether shes good pundit perfectly fine disagree wed better listening understand coming rather silly medium spat benefit nobody

womens game uk financially propped men game sure men game also 50 year advantage growth womens game seeing men banned woman playing football thats meritocracy argument fall apart honest meritocracy work everyone equal starting position equal advantage thats world created hardly like men football particularly meritocratic either money club likelier successful wellknown player likelier end pundit however biggest part backlash really alukos performance pundit lack charisma poor speaker struggle articulate real insight irrespective gender isnt well liked due lack ability fan really dont want hear comment woman held back obviously little talent clearly benefited others male female far deserving dont opinion punditry one way another honest ive simply seen little let real would people take equal offense rio ferdinand robbie savage ian wright making point genuinely dont think sure might regarded poor pundit backlash isnt taking proportion daily mail telegraph arent making big deal shes poor pundit theyre making big deal dare black woman predominantly white male space nice opportunity little antiwomen punching plenty people happily lap discussing exploring whether there something say thats detriment everyone including u men even shes poor pundit people dislike mean cant still make good point
none thats memed death world though im also indonesian partially spanishlanguage internet museum theft joke british museum know brazilian internet meme portuguesestolen gold thats ive seen hell dutch government returned bunch artefact taken colonialisation indonesian internet joke still british museum im way defending practice cant help feel joke overdone also help deflect conversation away others giving issue easy target point people genuinely blaming british museum artefact taken kept museum country
dogshit every facet pundit dont disagree isnt even rio owen shit least excellent playing career maybe give credit bank yeah 3 world cup 2 euro 1 olympics 100 appearance england mid fuck absolute nobody totally irrelevant saying shes female messi come im saying like ah ok
largely played woman football definitely know far acting like sole reason got job skin color rather incorrect
well happens issue dont feel super strongly lol suppose others felt way upvoted moved thank thats nice thing say
thats da love stuff reminds good old day big match
ban wrong also lifted 50 year ago plenty time build fan base
yeah agree point im sure men havent played put charge wsl club coverage ive seen womens football doesnt seem male dominated though wrong whenever ive watched womens football tournament ive found presenting punditry predominantly female led big discrepancy men football get broadcast much take long time change
sure like standard woman equally good football pundit compared men like obviously meritocracy really good idea want people good put position influence excel thats hardly reality live good important nowhere near enough rise top got right background right face right gender right skin colour right education right contact right accent given look thats reckon meritocracy often used strange way phil neville might well good football manager he appointed lioness manager despite previous senior managerial experience nevermind experience womens game ever see people championing vague idea meritocracy point absolute failure meritocracy cool men talk sexism explore way hinders u society big picture reckon time someone brings meritocracy little fig leaf protect status quo easy saying shes good enough shes every bit good male counterpart despite deck historically stacked thats im always bit edge someone try make meritocracy argument without actually defining believe meritocracy
genuinely contrarian interested merit look like people discussing ultimately boil sexism reckon truly basing thing merit wed close enough even gender split actually good pundit
yeh good post short dont think advantage men football womens anything time biological advantage wont overcome meritocracy saw gender equality would suggest gender capable quality product fundamentally case agree generally point though wider important area equality also dont agree view much race gender definitely idiot jump reason disingenuous ignore alukos lack ability beneficiary system chooses criticise people see drive respond comment race blatant hypocrisy antiwomen disagree plenty good female sport pundit fact id argue cricket absolutely stellar make point held back male representation would listen unfortunately aluko isnt talented broadcaster far probable lack opportunity see limitation innate prejudice
youve never seen joke meme america stealing land country general comment american imperialism certainly huge particularly minority leftist online community certainly seen stuff colonizing country specifically britain british museum like googled colonizer museum theft thishttpswwwvicecomenarticlemomanewyorkclosinginclusion first article found moma new york im sure there load also comment people failing realize existence colonizing power particularly interesting footy subreddit given thing whole argentina france chant debacle like said think there plenty conversation meme analysis etc around colonizing power one look even little hard meme american stealing oil shut colonizer joke applied everyone canada belgium black panther 1 2 commentary british american spanish colonization could go
many appearences youve made biggest achievement really mean dont achievement ill ask like ive asked everyone else who disagreedbut nobody answer strangely personally think aluko got much telly work despite unknowledgeable uninteresting unlikeable
lot woman also played womens football know lot think got job woman didnt
woman course equally good pundit men dont think anyone dispute capability watch game understand u thus able communicate viewer meritocracy one ability communicate articulate well football perfect system course there probably bloke could best electrician world he stuck repair nan nasa whatever mean abandon concept altogether probably eni aluko worth good pundit come across clueless lot thing helped clippable soundbytes say utterly ridiculous thing believe giving people demonstrably good job shout eni aluko proven shes top 10 maybe pundit even close phil neville thats weird agree might good enough thus acceptable appointment experience lady id find weird easy way say shes good enough isnt
probably first time seeing someone think eni actually good job strange thing happen
gender split irrelevant merit
meritocracy saw gender equality would suggest gender capable quality product fundamentally case dunno see tennis slightly different physical capability people seem enjoy pretty equally anyway get quite sport olympics seem pretty equally popular plenty good female sport pundit fact id argue cricket absolutely stellar make point held back male representation would listen right thats kind im getting way read alukos point may well offmark isnt shes bemoaning specifically held back sexist system womens football rather wider setup isnt affording opportunity woman men reckon doesnt need great broadcaster pundit point
yet default colonizer museum theft still british museum think youre conflating point making overused joke isnt even remotely accurate point colonisation colonisation joke general nobody make similar comment someone stolen artwork someone saying hang louvre regarding something beautiful done frenchman like mbappe wondergoal instance nobody make snarky display stolen comment visiting amsterdam rijksmuseum least downvoted seen party poopersomeone negative sake negative yet anything mention british museum way always invite comment people circlejerking including one sparked conversation begin theyre even made european whose country complicit thats mean overdone either treat every single one way without look even little hard put let damn joke die due overused british arent special
various reason people hired know ian wright get punditry job skin color knowledge football think likely huh
see appreciate comment ive got pegged good egg actually reasonable discussion stuff hand even dont agree dont really know much alukos punditry dont particularly care wider view removed personality involved structural side know football punditryfootball mediathis entire space football fandom like male perspective thats default weve always maledominated environment im genuinely interested female voice saying case reckon alukos making good point accidentally carelessly intentionally poorly framed mean woman half wlss manager men none 92 plefl manager men mean woman football men dont consider space theyre taking small niche womens game thats meritocracy come reckon even assuming best possible pundit could let real absolutely isnt mean woman get far fewer opportunity hone skill build career space meritocracy people uneven chance succeed first place want create meritocracy shouldnt consider intersectional factor help pave way best shine like yeah maybe eni aluko isnt good enough pundit wouldnt know ive seen enough tv dont think change much wider point structural issue brings honest probably call rio ferdinand poor pundit well yet he going replaced anytime soon someone better dont think there easy solution reckon valuable conversation woman maledominated space say there reason woman inherently worse pundit men exploring factor play big picture giving woman time space voice opinion beneficial everyone reckon well learn something might well end better pundit allow quality bubble top even leaf eni aluko behind like dunno feel quite strongly equality im also probably prone right audience whats ultimately highconcept discussion thread good example
half population planet share woman stand reason handing position merit well end even split there hardly going genetic advantage either way football broadcasting
really true tennis though womens game doesnt pull revenue men undeniably much lower level quality equal prize money tennis major really isnt great progressive move claimed woman essentially earn money men playing less playing worse still good watch yep absolutely aluko entitled make point others entitled call hypocrisy even shes making general commentary question credibility public eye doesnt brilliant broadcaster someone like isa guha response would different also fair people question alukos judgement somewhat wouldve easy make point without bringing ian wright situation shes made thing difficult

top 5 world world class yes noticed really committed offense really doesnt give defense plus attitude shame gifted player
he fantastic player high ceiling imo used incorrectly carlo ran ground also fair share blame thing gone season first half last season stuff dream pr perspective talk already justifying price tag etc imo show football objection kind stuff last season wouldve seen heavily downvoted luxury mctominayesque contribution mask average performance time train already fullspeed ahead clásico montjuïc distinctly remember gavi particular better overall game jude left headline first great strike fortunate winner contribution died second half season overshadowed vini grabbing headline example never pausa doesnt since isnt style midfielder physical attribute midfielder almost unmatched coach would love player like he obviously technicallycapable he used properly best role reach potential think he better pedri course isnt insult jude bias culer pedri potentially goatlevel imo clearly joke statement doesnt mean he suddenly fraud ajlike character see based madrid get develop ceiling still remains high

probably team reversed mind
changed view seeing var angle though one referee shown tbh make thing clear
maybe barely asencio smacking back make raphinha fall really dive either
premier sport commentator fucking shit especially old guy fucking hell he probably stupid person ive ever heard yap state obvious
rather ironically didnt dive absolutely would leg swiped likely penalty would stood unlike
asencios right knee hit raphinas left ankle cant plant foot fall clearly see first replay
looked like swiped leg live showed angle made look like penalty showed completely different angle var show little contact perspective commentator seeing angle look guilty showed angle var seeing along
isnt much controversy one contact raphinha go
controversy cant give pen 90 decide final var available raphinha straight dived gone shot
mean soft pen give nearly enough decide dramatic competition
hardly controversial decision right angle see asensio foot didnt even touch raphinha
im mad extra time though great game watch gf napping watch mean football wake make shit
urging everyone thinking referee always shit video refereeing result correct decision consider call impossible make call everyone agrees could gone either way matter many video angle slow motion never going 100 unanimous let learn live
bribe guarantee controversy
three handball super clear pedri get shirt ripped right ball bounced post ferran get leg swept balance
match ref could get away missing one making like time isnt match var intervened 2 though
sub would love penalty 9010 minute final

imo pull cubarsi first half lot clearer ferran play right call
one wasnt pen may made mistake ref known making mistake one let var review final minute match decider wasnt enough give final minute penalty others different conversation though
im sorry clear penalty wasnt given ferran slipped
pen needed studied 5 min var one cubarsi first half

dont get thing twisted corruption
agree sudden motion ankle make obvious would also say contact enough trip attempting take another step left foot contact dangerous rolling safely like going deceive referee thing natural instinct even child playing back yard referee give var benefit doubt probably got wrong looking opposite foot
ascencio doesnt touch clear dive yellow
push back contact raphinhas back leg
appalled people think one penalty even surprised commentator split one convinced penalty thought otherwise
well thought clear dive looked stonewall pen first var job
getting downvoted stating fact lmao
everyone saying doesnt touch clearly put hand back whether thats enough considered shove penalty another question definitely contact
mate youve gotten away 23 penalty
wasnt penalty 2 lol
well yes id agree thats said given understandable
push back contact contact
first angle show clear contact im fine giving penalty yellow wrong
real
first angle show clear contact im fine giving penalty yellow wrong
believe rudiger least yellow match mbappe shouldnt played penalty cubarsi first half pen ferran conclusion robbery
cubarsi got undressed far post var calling insane
spanish language espn commentator calling pen
going insane ferran one never pen barely tap ankle ferran throw ground cubarsi one absolutely pen
cubarsi one totally penalty
cubarsi one needed var check ferran pen
absolutely pen every touch pen
think fact people debating ferran curbasi one clear obvious enough go monitor unlike one initially thought pen 100 angle showed clear viewing thing think people complain justifiably without doubt card rudiger vazquez probably someone else clearly im forgetting
whole seen past 20 year champion league spain
shove never pen ferrans clear replay var chose send ref review
nah thats nothing cant scam penalty throwing ground
he already going imo
usually late game wont give pen push thats game decider theyre gon na give pen final minute got ta little substantial
already falling touched back
less smack flap
asencio actually punched var scammer didnt show barca bias sub moronic
really hahaah wtf dove clearly
everything make lose balance high speed even wind blowing lol player job maintain balance running
wouldnt enough final minute penalty usually
decision review var
ref field doesnt decide clear dive review
yes referee chooses go check youre absolute moron mate
trying pull reversenegreira uno card
final minute penalty review important
nah enough overturn ref probably communicated saw leg contact thats work hey leg contact hand maybe
stupid common sense cant put arm anywhere else
yes leading ceballos whoever pulled way pulled shirt hard pedri hand bit mainly real player kept pulling ball passed clearly crossed line
yes clearly prevented tap
one obvious
yes
clear shirt pull obvious pen lmao
football soft today defender cant shit forever
rüdiger made unnecessary foul shouldve punished one op talking foul
piece scum bit dramatic dont think
long opposing player fuck dribble stumble yeah
eh slap marginal pull give enough ground hold onfield call pussied would probably get stabbed street gave
thats clearly even true barca dodged multiple penalty free kick point
var cant change old penalty call rule var summoned
rüdiger ball deep mom
regular 40 year old mate play sunday league would see blatant dive dont need play professional buddy
totally unbiased lmao
one wasnt pen var minute
wonder people think var ref sit front monitor idk read book something
rüdiger one maybe fuck 2 supposed
would given favor u day lol
contact contact lol contact sport first match youve ever watched
second one debatable raf got hit back sure probably shouldnt go like one clear pen var didnt say anything beyond clearly campaign referee worked looking kind future
english commentator steve mcmanaman saying something madrid know right
moment one looked penalty report showed well timed dive
agree ferran one good non call var people spasming every contact player going easily
youre trying control ball one foot defender drag foot behind youre definitely going fall difficult understand
kinda wish atp tchouameni didnt score rudiger pulled ground never going give yall shut ref almost never anything foul corner saying way
fallon dor raphinia ferran
yeah pat back basically go youre diving dude weight arm behind arm player zero force ferrans look much clearer one fully deserving yellow card
cubarsi barely touched someone back conceded penalty
ill take word since see vini multiple time week
doesnt decide whistle lol
yeah never appreciated rationale sorry
similar cucurella v haaland last season
ferran pen cubarsi also pulling ceballos
cubarsi also pulled shirt ceballos probably thats wasnt given
think missed cubarsi also clearly pulling ceballos whole time
team pushing pulling corner night long without single foul called
foot swipe always pen fuck saying
seen half tackle rudiger put
player excuse behavior pitch even worse would get banned
penalty dodge give one time something game barca got favored
penalti favor del real madrid

see response like terrifies easily massive part society influenced ai really kick people bad enough
didnt believe explain joke
thought liked cutoff
restarts five yellow inside first 19 game onematch ban 10 yellow inside first 33 game twomatch ban 15 yellow threematch ban there cutoff
5 yellow first 19 game season 1 game andor 10 yellow total across first 32 game 2 game andor 15 yellow whole season 3 game get 5th yellow second half season there suspension
think cutoff date reset 5 within whole season
get suspended get 5 yellow first 19 game survive first 19 threshold increase 10
cutoff tho 19th game 5 yellow game 2032 10 yellow season 15 yellow
match limit sort get banned one game 5 yellow card occur within first half season
reset half way season think
reset 19 game 4 yellow suspended
threshold raise 10 halfway point
reset 30 match day think
saw commented winning first trophy bayern bundesliga like losing virginity prostitute doesnt count
yea think arsenal fan would almost prefer fuel tottenham never winning anything legend keep winning elsewhere
know wasnt
pretty sure stopped bout 4 year back
might defending probably called got away technicality proven guilty move
dont think kane issue he done twice wasnt nice however thing happen pitch dont act like he done many time partey done signature move turn deflecting away parteys behaviour mean dont think issue

grok true
autism exists
person vote mean much wild shit
joke kane never win trophy
2 3 match ban yellow card feel weird people england feel
could technically get 9 yellow without suspension start getting yellow game 20
huh never knew know since like thats actually smart good system
get 5 second half season none first half youre suspended genuinely didnt know part true
let say didnt score goal absolutely terrible might point would look like teammate carrying score lot goal creates lot plus leverkusen actually good threat isnt old day bayern used win league 20 point nice try

14 yellow start game 25
feel like forever point cant remember way
true cumulative season get 9 yellow two cut offs fine
theyll 12 last 13
downplaying issue bit interesting
could situation player would get 10th15th yellow 35th36th matchday trying get second yellow reduce punishment even happens 20 yellow
never happened yet seven time player reached 14
caicedo 10 yellow season hasnt suspended could get 4 next 4 still get suspended
like arsenal liverpool also mean premier league terrible nope best league world stop hating man
even happens 20 yellow jail
2 yellow game still count 2 separate yellow case well red game

2 yellow game always count 2 yellow since germany first yellow get deleted like got red card
also happened coincide xavi alonso going leverkusen turning champion leverkusen incredible campaign last year kanes fault happened year also bayerns defense much worse used yeah kanes fault
many city last 5 wanted win prem could went instead

theyre pulling supposed pen
way around would see replay next rmtv video ricardo de burgos selected officiate next match

tchouameni shouldve sent handball box called madrid game outrageously reffed
even mutual holding argument thats insane
holding carvajal thats never red sorry reddit hivemind
whats crazy var didnt even look could understand decide theyre pulling bit there pull cubarsi enough clear obvious error least take look
theyre holding pen probably fair
barça always playing 12 men nothing new barça score least 3 win rm safely
cant bellingham saying call pro barca
cheater playing cheater deal

nothing burger player pulling get hating madrid jfc
holding often get given pas one look clear literally pull back getting ball
arent guy holding pulling
whatever thing rm
reverse jersey youd fine called pk madrid lmao
attacker already goal side would prefer hold defender
yes youre dumb youre one unhinged drama addict support team
one looking ball hold ball come play wrong side free path tap
would cubarsi pulling he trying run towards goal ceballos pulling back hold start one player trying pull away ball prevent goal
idd pretty obvious sub filled barcabias
cubarsi trying get free already defender beat lmao
sub full 12 year old bunch dumb fan
one actively going ball impeded trying
dumb eye problem look closer tried push away
thats fair one pretty good goal scoring opportunity grabbing holding part game cant sanction attacker letting get thrown around case cubarsi already goal side ceballos one infraction
barca player apparently
lol attacker already goal side make difference
circle jerk match thread yea barcelona shouldve gotten one penalty referee missed 12 yellow id say real madrid people acted damn dramatic every situation
yeah weird echo chamber none friend watching think penalty 0 real fan lol
reversed sub saying madrid paid ref called pk lmao
never ott argument made he also pulled back would got ball
cubarsie back
shirt pull cubarsi
found var team
tap doesnt get dragged ground
cubarsi pulled back back post need toe goal
back post cubarsi trying get rebound
also illegally grabbing defender stopping getting correct position
think tight one less claim make think penalty go ball end going backwards key moment theyre also pulling crazy wasnt given
blind look closer
ceballos didnt look ball obvious intent foul block cubarsi looking ball
colossal argument ceballos able contest ball cubarsi wasnt pulling whole time
going ball would surely goal shirt practically ripped universe penalty
exactly holding cubarsi isnt let go pen
theyre still holding though course one going try less hard stay upright situation im seeing anything problematic ref call unless really want usual
really youre allowed compete man given curbasi fall basically horizontal see force applied
watch clip start cubarsi getting dragged around
think barca player want go ball madrid player holding shirt prevent
fuck cubarsi trying get free
stonewall pen comment ridiculous
arent youre clueless way way way way shocking someone would get mad would called anyone fucking obviously pen
ask clearly see video
doesnt matter fact arm around defender make hard var intervene
even see rm player pulled cubarsi falling
maintain position keep defender getting goal side
remain goal side draw penalty
know would help tap dont hold onto guy who position free path goal
im rooting barca said look cubarsi ground rm player get jerked last second clip braindead cubarsi hold onto opponent arm
ok pull player stop
youre american
grabbing holding may part game allowed via rule either player definition theyre fouling
side goal important letter law excessive handling happening way attacker doesnt get call one could score
cubarsi let go may point would referee decide favour one player hold
everyone saying hope barca would trash madrid game course cry everything
sub hate madrid barca fan whiny bitch perfect combo get braindead take still dont get people sub mad rma vids criticizing ref blatant bribery corruption negeira football fan arent known standard
absolutely pen
thats one way admit friend 0 ball knowledge lmao
oh well friend think must true sorry questioned friend impeccable judgment
meh theyre wrestling never going get
damn strat looking rüdiger dont notice fouler didnt work
good one man
wont position score didnt pull ceballos whole time
two player wrestling nothing
cant watching clip ceballos position fouling get advantage ceballos initiate contact cubarsi grab back cubarsi try separate play ball ceballos never try play ball clip
blind theyre initiating contact happens literally every corner
universe universe madrid player made foul
theyre uploaded title clear foul cubarsi given yes imo
doubt youve got arm around defender hard var call obvious error
doesnt fall horizontally he damn near disrobed lmao clear penalty
clip different one he holding onto guy try stick leg fallsgotta let go guy make clear youre hindered making play ball playing patty cake defender
stonewall pen didnt get called commentator didnt call barca fanboys upset sure buddy
hed say he trying push defender away done physically making contact yanking pushing making defender lose balance somehow
rm player look like pulled bc he pulling barca player simple
lol yeah player whose jersey he obviously pulling tugging direction
explain pulling defender towards keep goalside thats even mention putting egg pk basket instead tapin really dumb
here one
guess youre right dont know whats anymore
ceballos fall he pulled cubarsi onto lmao
get jerked arm holding jersey lol come
first time
point one player clearly impeding ceballos pulled pau reach ball saving goal whatever grabbing pau beginning didnt prevent impede dani
exactly american made reddit usa world
yeah sure franco
isnt letter law discretion official especially important decision foul player competing position goal bound literal reason handling attacker already goal side defender apparent likely theyll get call vise versa
would prefer holding guy scoring clear pen
american trying lecture football lol
good luck trying talk logic illogical fan base cubarsi didnt even ask penalty barca player protested fan watching tv
heavy lifting he getting held back trying reach ball look jersey
wrestling cebalos hold collar cubarsi try push tf would cubarsi wrestle ceballos situation he behind
cant argue see initiated first
dude look angle cubarsi try push away grab arm cubarsi reason pull

penalty yes understand ref wouldnt call though much hate flopping still got ta make clear ref youre interested scoring hugging man
dont know someone probably ask
great question
sad american know football lmaooo
mean cubarsi pulling keep defender getting ahead woudl crazy weak penalty give
yes see problem arm also around ceballos could argue pau preventing ceballos getting goalside theyre holding eachother cant make call one favour
youre guaranteed get call youre also instigating contact
could deemed similar divecontactavoidance attacker sometimes dont get foul gone normally risk injury even odds getting foul higher initiator judged action rule allows unless shirtcontact jossling uniform hard dissect instance uniformity condition isnt met cubarsi ragdolled far critically degree arent equivalent prevented reaching ball shoot goal principle cubarsi holding onto defender bad excuse sabotage situation meanwhile excuse defender still holding attacker goalscoring position
hahah im sure help say addict fair
yeah someone ask vasquez pulling attacker confident penalty wont called
started way cubarsi wouldnt try hold saw ball coming way think point resisting pull fall
clearly arent guaranteed without either
could deemed similar divecontactavoidance attacker sometimes dont get foul gone normally risk injury even odds getting foul higher get case risk injury letting pulled would made obvious who fault think player used pushing pulling penalty area place cant see video initiated
tf wrong
someone reminded cubarsi wasnt defending corner hed simply let go man turned around hed tap

bet
look like ref played advantage cant book stopping promising attack referee play advantage offence cautionsendingoff would issued play stopped cautionsendingoff must issued ball next play however offence denying opposing team obvious goalscoring opportunity player cautioned unsporting behaviour offence interfering stopping promising attack player cautioned
paying barca go together many million many year pay
type foul happens dozen time game
legitimately look rattled
playing advantage clip
nah dude yellow every 3 foul wont long
seem focused killing olmo least first half
advantage given yellow awarded foul merit stopping promising attack
yellow tactical foul card cant given advantage played borderline necessarily wrong
exactly happens time
yellow every game wasnt even called faul lil bro
gave advantage
rule edit realized people meant foul tactical foul
isnt yellow rule
doesnt stop attack luck unfortunately madrid spilled way allowed attack continue still appears tactical foul really getting yellow saw play assumed ref simply played advantage would give yellow later
lmao completely forgets ball grab drop olmo never talk football
isnt even yellow ffs
fede one cause thats landing hand
wasnt hand ground
he breaking fall pen
yeah challenge deserves yellow regardless challenge affected attack
remembering shit make angry first barrel kdb shoulder roll around pitch holding face fouled

nah also got away lot shit chelsea
nah dont compare triple single king player may asshole theyre way beyond talent wise
mate getting stuff head doesnt matter ref give advantage
watched rudiger elbow olmo chest walk away w card
coincidence mystery casemiro ramos rudiger lucas ref fair player would shown red every 3 game minimum real player play different rule
he casemiros heir
would get scared home get doxed family get abused go verge losing job
thats rule
guy cry ref didnt give red card espanyol player yellow game team claim robbery mainly red given
many offside ucls
correct however usually followed yellow card
rudiger rattled
advantage doesnt cancel yellow card
yep ref arm go advantage pretty much one thread understands rule
correct answer read law 12 going yellow spa give advantage yellow yellow given advantage foul reckless
mean pretty clearly advantage given ref 100 shouldve given yellow play stopped
know outrage type foul arent yellow every game woudve wouldve watched 90m game wouldve finished forfeit min 60 maybe watch premier league serie
played advantage negates yellow card
foul kiddo
yellow tackle merit stopping counter
tactical foul ref play advantage yes
yes
mate liverpoool flair premier league 20 intervention like per game la liga outrage rm everything minimum yellow
doesnt stop attack luck unfortunately madrid spilled way allowed attack continue doesnt stop promising attack ie yellow tactical foul
ref played advantage yellow foul merit cant give yellow stopping counter attack
httpswwwtheifabcomlawslatestfoulsandmisconduct advantage referee play advantage offence cautionsendingoff would issued play stopped cautionsendingoff must issued ball next play however offence denying opposing team obvious goalscoring opportunity player cautioned unsporting behaviour offence interfering stopping promising attack player cautioned still think youre right
well know gattuzo dirty well least getting booked guy elbow least 5 time game finish one card best

oil club oligarch club less embarrassment sport real madrid
hierro sanchís rm defneders long history violence
var cant intervene unless red card challenge iirc
thats madrid acquired
tactical foul stopping promising attack yellow card given advantage played
literally confidentially wrong please look law game sanction administered next stoppage offence denying opposing team obvious goalscoring opportunity player cautioned offence interfered stopped promising attack player cautioned straight ifab
pen given ceballos hug cubarsi either
yes referee play advantage offence cautionsendingoff would issued play stopped cautionsendingoff must issued ball next play however offence denying opposing team obvious goalscoring opportunity player cautioned unsporting behaviour offence interfering stopping promising attack player cautioned people actually know rule moaning referee standard though
genuinely dont know youre talking honest im chelsea fan cant remember watching espanyol game year
changed rule
doesnt basic foul wrapped olmo purposely stopped without trying get ball yes stopping attack automatic yellow isnt happened rudiger moved play ball missed
read post title buddy one discussing advantage rule question whether yellow card offense absolutely cynical foul tactical take player dangerous counter
pretty much one thread understands rule dont think understand basic english people complaining rudiger receiving yellow card title
youve missed point post entirely
anymore advantage given go back give caution
right missed however angry arsenal fan chasing every comment telling never yellow weird
even 2 minute penalty ice hockey fuck yapping
also 15min game common give warning two carding someone understand real hated team subreddit god damn people hyperbolic
thats work yellow card player
got good sentence start capital letter way
actually thought people meant foul virtue tactical foul
dont argue reddit soccer dont know rule rm everything yellow
completely forgetting playing ball charging another player doesnt merit yellow lmao
yes yellow action nothing opportunity clear completely disregarded ball ran another player take bashed lmao unbelievably oblivious
impact foul significantly weakened promising attack yamal check forward run olmos forward directionality completely halted foul wo rudigers foul wouldve 4 barca shirt 3 real defender ultimately counter ended 2v3 real favor advantage attempted fully successful neutralizing impact foul ref issue yellow card
tbf red utd b like grabbing someone collar
theyre spoiled brat sportswashing project steeped blood definitely different level
idk oil club based killing blood sure true
let go far
dude club ref payroll
ruggeri dirty motherfucker
youve highlighted part mean anything relative rudiger interfere promising attack still commit challenge warrant yellow advantage played doesnt grant immunity player rule moreso situation petty foul may committed otherwise large implication player another get shot chance created obviously doesnt need booked grabbing player pulling shirt diving etc counter advantage played doesnt mean cant booked
isnt
youre absolutely correct downvotes show clueless everyone
people absolutely insane mate theyve lost head there speaking lmao
professional foul break 100 ocean avenue

black white rulebook offence stopping promising attack isnt yellow card advantage given team fouled challenge would need meet yellow card criterion like reckless get one per rule
yes check rule explicitly say dont book
oh yeah still give yellow warranted standalone foul sure one would tho imo
hahahahahahahahahaha victim complex massive margin historically favored ref team hilarious pathetic
hadnt happened context counter attack would yellow id think something happens fairly often
definitely werent aware advantage rule instead acknowledging youre doubling
wait ref supposed consider factor lmao
half many deserved
seeing game well would say ref payroll he payroll yeah keep bringing club profit many time ref decision especially cbs kinda always spoken dirty player
like parrot never miss beat
head association assigns referee proven sporting benefit
show receipt stfu
cant book stopping promising attack said highlighted important part thats rule said highlighted relevant bit correct
yes unless anything contradicts black white passage law game quoted
arent denying promising attack theyre still attacking promisingly dumb rule still go back give yellow card reckless foul whatever

know gone attitude changed massively season
given build match jude comment half time vini lordy vasquezs protest 120 min rudigers bottle throw ice fully sure yet given carlos word interpretation isnt ref neutral helped real madrid least sound like he still upset ref performance feel victimized
said talk referee think thats saying doesnt want get
oh fuck worst time watch football history simulation tackle argues ref medium bulshit football kind circus team

kind like mourinhos speak im trouble kind
many get classy rep ancelotti constantly get

hell bent proving ref world incompetent cheat wouldnt know excellent call even slapped face even though good angle around 045 046 explain ref call arguable elbow back blue forward jump ball red number 4 slight elbow mind fact slow motion tends distort perception actually happened much blue attacker exaggerates elbow clear intent elbow least debatable call least scandalous one far away scandalous zone fair thats guy ref well fortunately arent really one many way football sorry sad state people keep defending var necessary thing ref supposedly shit make right call without var clue whether referee actually able job without var rule game refereeing supposed really even presented said holy video image knowing truth couldnt see clear foul even though stare face thread show

blue going ball number 4 going elbow back dont put elbow forward stand ground could put hand back without pushing signal blue standing behind sensible defender usually trying make lawful challenge hinder opposing attacker lawful way contact sport nowhere law game try check fact word contact actually mostly used law game characterize foul tell ref let contact happen without anything come particular situation elbowing opponent back penalty area generally considered illadvised according law game im pretty sure football coach would prefer defender didnt least get caught least savory absolutely right different interpretation lot refereeing interpret situation oftentimes opposite decision situation receivable even right wrong interpretation situation according law game make wrong thats big deal suppose whats one guy spouting whatever go head come refereeing suppose difficult make sorry state debate around refereeing worse already far situation concerned though ref call nowhere near scandalous least according law game homemade rule contact sport im pretty sure ref made correct call referee make call according homemade rule he enforce law game period

imagine one highest revenue generating club world unable compete based transfer value god weve mismanaged fucking atrociously sad
ive wanted bayern nearly 3 year exact kind keeper weve needed yet keep getting keeper nowhere near profile needed
need smart van der sar signing like sommer
200m january much think theyll spend summer another 200m
feel weird see city go diogo costa pep specific regarding goalkeeper want diogo bad foot distribution ok feel he good allround keeper ball playing one
look like man utd gazump city
man utd interested diogo costa couple year ago ended getting onana great cl season inter
reality think want player summer wont getting bidding war keeper especially instance struggle sell onana limited fund even think aiming 150m sale
mean debt lot like said shocking money spent1 billion hasnt amounted anything certainly stability
much selfpity united fanbase day oh woe club cant compete every single expensive signing world time everyone feel sad u reason united cant financially compete costa today club broke transfer record sign onana last season fact manchester united cant keep signing expensive keeper world consecutively isnt sad perfectly normal expected regardless theyll spend another 150200m summer like every summer recent memory
im sure black white case weve linked lot keeper last day young upandcoming keeper youd expect better backup altay eventually challenge onana starting spot went costa money involved would mean hed start would make sense got fee onana thats coming summer might able drop say 50m costa worth expense business need need sort attack look like going happen cunha delap need look wing back midfield option shaw doesnt seem option lwb imo dorgu squad player nothing point dont know amass diego leon going develop summer right weve got amad dalot mazraoui none perfect fit differing reason top enjoyed bruno playing deeper point he going break realistically need bring someone carry ball deep position try turn mount mainoo player hope kone develops quick enough either way well need sign someone crucial delivering rubens game model get running consistently reliably ease pressure onana maybe start making less mistake start looking goalkeeper finish functioning team
ive always thought guy would fitting club career progression neuer presence squad factor kind investment bayern
well let hope urbig step shown good promise far
sommer smart signing
sorry guy cry actually even depends outgoings get offloading bernardo silva kdb grealish already million pound week freed personally think could 300m
yes going cry oh sad
new alexis fred
there guarantee diogo becomes great united team even signed 23 year ago
gon na happen doesnt want leave would
took personally got defensive didnt
trying gauge strong next season
cant much worse onana single handedly cost united multiple point champion league run
talking 36 year old sommer team like united looking rebuild stability quickfix
find funny sub meltdown every time city spends money apparently team world allowed rebuild sub hissy fit anything city
fair enough
yes who also one best goalkeeper world even rebuild need actual good player goalkeeper like one position dont always need replenish youngster youve got decent one young goalkeeper youre looking price range going worse veteran playing right
want counter energy preemptively throwing hissy fit
scam relegation battle
credit back back promotion great manager actually decent away home year better home form last one regulated arguably worst team think back sooner later
ipswich well next year think maybe step far back back promotion
april 3 promoted championship team already
cheer ed sheeran cry rn
ipswich got promoted league 1 squad spent load theyve built solid squad next season plus best 3 promoted club fair fuck
one 3 sense pride theyve done season fact best promoted side year ipswich best year luton show much complete shamble 4 side
see 2627
thank much id like thank muric parent birthing mckenna playing massive huge potato head apparent ketamine addiction fucking u shoutout philogene well forgettable record signing ive ever seen
obviously enjoyable theyve crashed burned hard ever spending 130m nearly 20 year mediocrity let face theyll absolutely piss championship next season squad batter u least become dominant yoyo club next year
worst relegation battle
maresca gave lot 4points
best thing ive heard west ham fan month apart fullkrug interview
kind refreshing hear much intense speculation surrounding manager boundtobe relegated team ipswichs mckenna season especially summer rumour potentially leaving club often find team relatively calm panicking scrambling around trying find replacement save fate relegation plus given theyve planned eventuality looking recruitment past two window must surely wellequipped quick return
honestly start season worried wed break derby record considering 5 year ago still great position clearly early squad come
guess thing left european spot witness west ham united spur battle worst three
let never forgotten many point much momentum muric cost ipswich deserves hounded ipswich
hope well come back stronger future lost bet surprising result season thanks chelsea
promoting soon time build stronger squad
fuck ed sheeran less jokey response shame relegation scrapis fully april goddamn ipswich tried well nowhere near level long term damning indictment 2 18th
admit kind hoping west ham would taken point newcastle werent one send sir bobby derby hopefully theyll back within season two
bottom three finish 40 gd
surprising
pretendstobeshockedjpeg
ipswich switched pl2
bottom three rightfully laughed second season row complete surprise promoted team turn best fighting team relegation battle
ipswich fan whats expectation around mckenna
thank god
relegation battle absolutely atrocious season 3 awful team
insert bielsa looking confused ever learn say name
good riddance
league reduced 18 team pathetic showing promotion side twice would least make relegation interesting midtable club like spur man united
well hope get goal top boy
ufakecinnamon lmao
read newcastle first thought missed something
gap prem efl widening relegation battle likely remain scam foreseeable future
nothingburger title race zero jeopardy final day feel like last year
one goalkeeper remember making lot mistake
league one two season ago still load momentum fan turned player manager new owner theyll lose delap keep hold hutchinson philogene theyll place come straight back
didnt keep coach whole season kept thinking smart move assume going back get coach great experience take back maybe come back
crash wall like luton
feel like everyone said luton though obviously worrying many defeat hit confidence
close disaster scenario 6 team rotating every year 3 direct promotion spot playoff wed probably see soon
said dd yesterday hasnt championship winner hasnt recently relegated pl past 6 season longest gap 2000s 3 year didnt time check unreasonable think longest weve ever gone without longterm championship participant winning premier league financial rule formed gulf pl championship 2nd gulf team recently relegated premier league championship team grim dont see thing getting better either
hell get entire album season
said luton last season
think mckenna staying
still smashed u portman rd tbf
ill miss next season x
hadnt heard ketamine thing would explain lot
theyve become thing hate norwich
delap leave sure hutchisons maybe
next year
ange gave u 4 point well
everything
thank fuck promoted team shite year
he already mentioning next season interview contract like paying hope stay think well end like luton leaf
must named
spent 100m season pretty much tell fault system broken
whats wrong ipswich
fan stateowned sportswashing operation spent way midtable oil money who making league uncompetitive gap first second division big
look following result youre welcome buy shirt scarf club shop
one premier league club eventually throw financial ruin trying get european football time half championship get premier league
promoted team want chance staying theyre gon na take nottingham forest approach break psr rule spending recklessly take point deduction hope player youve brought make enough difference worth
agree widened dont think season good barometer leicester southampton woefully mismanaged ipswich werent ready pl promotion
fair three 2122 promoted team still genuinely competitive
championship side really shit thing decade mind
thats shortsighted view 3 season ago three side stayed theyre top 10 leeds strong chance staying next year take weaker promoted side financial implosion wolveswest hameverton etc one year theyll stay
team started coming tried play expansive football clearly cant execute well enough get result burnely luton last year southampton ipswich year known try play right way look got team need pragmatic dont know steve cooper got sacked considering actually 16th time guess wasnt expansive enough
season anomaly last year relegation battle went last 2 game 3 team separated 2 point 3 game go year clearcut southampton spent long playing way wasnt working hired manager wouldnt work leicester appointed manager took scoring 14 15 game scoring 4 29 game ipswich nailed playing l1 football two year ago
isnt muric also made load mistake last year burnley went
muric seller guy need
signed many player last summer like jack clarke szmodics jacob greave dara oshea probably havent made splash prem know fact great championship player make spine title winning side unless sheffield united dont win playoff think theyll top league next season
kieran mckenna took league one prem wouldve utter stupid sack either keep sell like burnley kompany
ya never gunna sack mckenna really lot goodwill club fan love knew squad really thin prem standard anyway
think bad squad remain mostly adding chance yoyoing
dont worry shamble director football danger u coming back fact well donate spot another plucky team doomed eternity championship
time maybe hell finally graduate calculus symbol he done basic arithmetic
seems keen
light work nkunku disasi felix honestly
whats ketamine thing
seeing theyre slowly dropping table season season seemingly ambition norwich appear becoming u circa 10 year ago well
nah think burnley leeds much better equipped least make decent fist unlike southampton leicester hustled worse version relegated squad
bud
take train find
need money tbf nah popped top sub since always great laugh club like ipswich go embarrassingly
everton close survived skin teeth
worked forest cant say replicable process
one premier league club eventually throw financial ruin trying get european football ahh good old day
see blyth spartan almost didnt lose today
cant anymore psr youre going end getting point deduction ruining anyway
club decide bite bullet doesnt work supposed next taking plunge similar manner forest fail guarantee safety financial ruin almost imminent like promoted club arent stumping cash seam either ipswich southampton spend 100m transfer fee summer meanwhile leicester spend 80m well definitely lack trying
didnt break psr spending recklessly received money selling johnson deadline offered window tried argue could backdated would passed wed sold 30m june instead 47m august
get think say previous season financially mismanaged luton werent equipped premier league campaign well regardless burnley disappointment problem though 17 club next season premier league minimum three consecutive season essentially 300m headstart promoted team like id say west ham probably weakest 17 moment paqueta 55 brazil cap bowen 16 england cap fullkrug 22 germany cap top player like kudu soucek alvarez etc club coming championship simply cant compete
2 year row weve known who going since november ignore anomaly year 2223 trending way think 10 11 last 15 promoted side going straight back even getting 30 point process im sorry thats concerning probably due individual circumstancesmismanagement definitely dont buy hadnt sold ndiaye berge leicester hadnt appointed rvn saint burnley bit pragmatic luton ipswich spent extra 50m whatever thing wouldve different gulf big dont know promoted side meant finishing youre probably looking like wolf west ham everton palace etc selling couple key player disaster season even side still stacked full superstar established international im sat watching palace cup semi thinking team potentially might need finish next year want survive yet absolutely light year ahead u one player pitch walk side instantly becomes best player dont know anyone supposed bridge sort gap one season
wouldve agreed wasnt fact happened two season row isnt normal three promoted club getting relegated incredible rare happened twice row
last year relegation battle thanks point deduction otherwise wasnt close
correct however least burnley trafford head time putting muric back made least bit sense
kinda feel like deja vu statement luton last year hope im wrong confidence mean lot
yeah think smart move seen many instance manager let go
theory heard current premier league team run competent way small team like fullham nottingham forest brighton would expect relegation battle ten even five year ago run much professional way long term strategy made highly competent people club would expect 10th 17th simply much better level make ofcourse much harder newly promoted team get point need survive
least based past two season would seem relegated 2223 leicester city promoted back one season immediately relegated leeds united playoff last year back year southampton promoted back one season immediately relegated relegated 2324 luton town relegation scrap burnley promoted sheffield united playoff missed automatic promotion ___ granted two season evidence huge sample size seeing much better burnley leeds sheffield united rest championship doesnt necessarily bode well considering last season top 4 championship much better rest historically bad season year good omen
early new year gift enzo marescer
completely made probably true
whilst wont deny shite finish playoff last season quite season season
look mediocre championship club
see going expense wolf
leeds sold high profile player replaced championship player worse manager ownership group tight purse string
saw got giddy tag must left big impression like rose valentine btw
pickford honestly deserves statue worldclass performance week week relegation fight thing standing u administration
actually dont think forest trying get european football hell bent going back championship say going pay everyone
yeah thats good get right maybe couple season level start scrape draw
mean important youve scouted well inserted relegation clause salary imminent financial ruin could sell 23 good player bought try next year even relegated prem lucrative
three season ago three promoted club stayed three top10 also like leicester ipswich hopeless start 19 game leicester 14 point ipswich 15 wolf 16 since leicester scored 4 point ipswich 6 wolf 25
one season went last 2 game technically last game gd sealed point forest played beat two three team last three game season forest hadnt beaten sheffield united quite easily could 2 3 promoted going
much manager fullham bournemouth forest survived 2 season ago forest bournemouth played counter attacking football tried grind result promoted team last 2 season stuck championship style trying control possession play back punished
agree come fancy chance target guess hoping everton wolf west ham really poor season even youre looking probably 36 point bare minimum survive tall order fancy 3 go back next year honestly best chance option open club spend like mad take point deduction
cool doesnt change fact close like forest deducted lot either relegation battle still would taken 36th match week even 4 extra point point deduction equated relegation battle ending one week later
ipswich significantly stronger squad luton opinion
luton squad journeyman still hutchinson clarke philogene greave etc better player anyone luton last year
yeah seem like there kind inbetween league burnley leicester leeds southampton sheff united one club compete
yeah tbh im trying manifest something
wolf maybe west ham could also see someone like brentford struggle get manager pinched spur perhaps think theyll struggle course think theyll least make fight hope anyway
west ham borrowed time unless sack potter wouldnt surprised see 19th october sack
there good chunk 6 7 team lose couple key player sold injury lose manager could suddenly slip table still requires farkeparker step recruitment good obviously well obviously favourite go rightly think past couple season made people forget pretty easy bad summer window happen go midtable suddenly nervous relegation mean look west ham going 9th 17th last season bottom 3 awful thats made avoid kind relegation battle
bone better squad player ready make step better wage structure two year clear leaving u significantly room spend leicester went verge financial collapse didnt even premier league money filled hole already survival still tough ask definitely better position leicester southampton last year
pickford could forced move year ago hasnt deserves lot praise staying would easily number one man united spur chelsea even arsenal
think goal european football theyre ahead schedule
seems like new manager making positive impact hope next season must get game next season havent made many id like year
mad seem simultaneously low block shithouses naively sticking gun last season depending team weve played pundit talking u came early there much else
also shitty transfer leicester wasted million okoli skipp ayew got unlucky fatawus injury burnley failed buy competent keeper last season trafford wasnt ready last year muric diabolical luton ipswich ready
fullham bournemouth forest survived 2 season ago forest bournemouth played counter attacking football tried grind result ive said people realise confirms gap widening fulham bournemouth squad built premier league money parachute payment champ whilst forest literally broke spending rule stay isnt indicator health made
mean brentford absolutely fine
perhaps blind optimism ipswich get promoted next season might good position stay bought lot young talented player havent quite good enough coupled bottom half league probably strongest many year majority player stay next season year playing well together come back prem two year older experienced last time could stand u good stead
overselling much he average keeper average shot stopper everything else
sure hope takeover promising well hopefully stabilize next year live canada havent gone match age news get day online couple mate sometimes go home match
couple point today ball high trying play back agree came quickly hopefully back long
keep squad less together got chance there always chance path 38 point look really difficult
stopping shot main job keeper
honestly ask goalkeeper praise pickford kingdom come tell someone doesnt understand position criticise certain player
agreed lost discussion bottom 3 4th bottom likely 40 point end season even better transfer window less injury luck refereeing decision might still gone point total would enough survive season
ball playing ability put ceiling kind level could play he definitely worthy sort regular european competition
he good playing ball people meme bc injured van dijk number one rule england fan hate 1 keeper
top level keeper enough
distribution poor doesnt command box always likely throw clanger sure anyone disagree fact
yeah thats worrying thing gap big issue team come go decent player nicked rebuild isnt easy money spend although mean even sunderland finally manage come likely wont put long
number one rule england fan hate 1 keeper squad ftfy

mean considering still lost game whats point discussion win
watching guy really make appreciate arteta much already
guy sacked theyre 16th
90 fan living club city tottenhams situation would wanted anyone trying act like spur fan wrong never experienced city rivalry imagine mocked year year one handing title rival 20 year drought chance qualify cl villa still fate hand spur behind

erik ten hag 2 trophy heh ange postecoglou finished 5th mate

100 spur fan base idiot
official rule club intentionally losing match
might actually least favourite manager ever pl unlikable constant victim mentality
okay team losing main rival doesnt win title okay actively cheering team lose even tho mean wont get cl pathetic cl main difference big team wannabee

finishing fifth acceptable season spur thing considered cant remember spur fan said disaster finish fifth last season disappointing get cl sure disaster especially first season postkane
funny bit lot put injury fit cbs good stretch season except even romero vdv came back kept losing
guy spend billion still shit difference
spur chelsea city though 5th club like spur massive achievement
spur loss point going help city get title prevent arsenal winning
spur fan wanted lose man city last year deny arsenal title
arsenal wouldve level point city city lost spur like customarily past year arsenal way ahead gd thry lost arsenal lost league 2 point
spur playing city point two ahead arsenal
httpswwwmirrorcouksportfootballnewsangepostecogloutottenhamarsenalcity32785813
he got inflated sense self worth genuinely belief he incredible manager faultless come spur table dont know people call charming find arrogant completely unlikable
ange could genuinely say anything could say sky blue grass green youd get moron like generally didnt watch video listen question journalist asked using analyse character like shakespeare play
every spur manager like maybe issue isnt manager
dont mean sound nasty he aged much since took spur job
speak
guy talk much press conference required people ask load question come man grow
around 25 entire point tally spur come first 10 game yeah 2nd half couple month
premeditated hysteria as shite year half
shite several month game happened
theyre europa final would sack season end
jesus christ thank sensible take whole situation ive ever heard think criticism mentality came american international football fan dont understand rivalry truly mean people live city handing arsenal title fan perspective would painful something wed never lived would rather deal arsenal fan moaning loser mentality didnt want win league arsenal fan laughing jubilation u handing title know id rather interestingly remember year spur cl final arsenal el final chelsea arsenal fan asked whether would rather lose el final meant spur lost cl final 90 said yes could handle seeing spur win cl dont blame normal
cant say logical thing rgoonerscirclejerk also people seem forget situation occurred well aware 2 outcome arsenal win title join cl would never win deny arsenal title part el better chance winning semi final
sure losing game ended hope cl point winning game still chance
weird behaviour ill bite he obviously talking general sentiment fan game clearly literally asked lose game football hasnt said much also youve completely ignored comment post actually literally nothing say asked knew youd look stupid tagged comment completely different post day later like weirdo talking atmosphere game amongst home fan stay watching game basement canada kid leave actual opinion happens game people game

football fan idiot
found youre deliberately would match fixing spur enough plausible deniability get away however
absolutely insane suggest spur fan didnt care result game last season

nowhere comment post rcoyshttpsoldredditcomrcoyscomments1k87q5tthis_time_last_year_i_was_asked_to_lose_a_game see sentiment like lie supposedly fanbase
complete lie theyve already league want stop fucking losing game
simply true
seriously thats well something sure
user certainly mean year youll get cl spot el spot
definitely im sure spur fan hoping brilliat start way chelsea fan hopig lot christmas
5th one season kane accomplishment
thought better posed go far europa league champion league thinking wed build last season though instead implode
getting cl last year could given spending option avoid shit season
nowhere comment say werent shit youre insecure cause tottenham fact shit
u act like tottenham dont money
chelsea big team difference big 6 longer thing couple year enjoy new normal
agree he talking club he talking 5th place ignoring fact 5th cl football season wasnt last season
bear mind match also mix cl
wasnt losing saying oh well least hurt rival actively celebrating stand city scored
legitimately cheering stand city scored lmao
right thing
widened gap city imply arsenal ahead city wasnt true city kept 2 point lead pretty much end despite arsenal winning 14 last 15 game
arsenal wouldve level point city city lost spur gap 2 point even draw would seen arsenal leapfrog city
talk extremely well lot charisma seem extremely stubborn doesnt seem take lot responsibility thats medium sure privately think people constantly talking negatively trigger defense mechanism dont even want give inch happened ten hag well started open honest thing started turn sour hed throw every mental gymnastic ring admit criticism might right
probably hasnt helped people act like accomplishment par cl club manager literally got argument fault spur fan appointed level liverpool appointed klopp man success australia scotland plenty people arent even pl level manager let alone big club level manager done
really turned played u everton equalised late ange whole post match interview mumbling staring shoe embarrassingly childish
spud signed manager built championship surprised result small club thing
im sorry youre chatting shit he saying medium hysteria around spur finishing lowest ever point total premier league era premeditated towards certain outcome ie getting sack cite coming 5th last season achievement given chasing cl football read one quote history perhaps worst persecution complex manager season dont think thats unfair dont think youre moron disagreeing think like ange good job celtic fair enough fault ange star referee medium
bro remember liverpool fan saying defended var made horrible call liverpool ange actually shitting people dont care people say care public perception ange saying yeah game posted hot page context headline obviously
havent nearly two year even
definitely lost weight sure dieting stress spur

absolutely insane stat
youre right final far away sack yet
shouldve sacked 4 month ago
theyre europa league final still another team way fuck every club top five league though might well exist
bodø glimt may something say
mean happened jose mourinho carabou cup final
afraid banter youd rather throw game thats sad even youd prefer absurd expect manager player would completely destroy integrity game think clear rivalry mean live city way damn much beyond healthy
people remember happened end last season wouldve qualified ucl got result previous 4 match nobody wanted u throw away ucl qualification shit month arsenal winning league small consolation prize
even qualified champion league trophy mocked year year rival worth qualifying tournament chance win easy say live far club city live breathe club totally different story
lol insecure behavior go profile find something diminish argument used live london toddler moved canada better dental care lol

money spent european game decent
given much levy willing spend el suit u better imo
thank lol feel like im reading bizzaro comment wouldnt 16th got ucl last season first place
barca fan lmao
criticizing chelsea city made proper use billion actually make good signing
reason spur ever involved big 6 discussion kane medium couldnt handle england captain playing mid table team he gone spur revert usual position mid table occasional relegation battle thats place
unserious club
match zero bearing finishing 4th
see lot maybe fan game one section cheered conceded didnt see anybody stadium celebrating usual groan people joking atmosphere ground muted generally little youd expect im confident saying everybody around wanted u win game least outwardly maybe there video havent seen far see narrative mostly based random spur fan social medium account ground
true mad people think true
spur fan genuinely went match spur light blue away jersey show support man city
wonder time likely last season influence ange
youre right ill edit main point arsenal wouldve league spur beat city still stand though
run want lose 2 point thats crazy guess voodoo city

tbf thats wanting lose game thats desperation fucking trophy since season long long gone relegation equation make sense fan care europa would still like win league course beggar cant chooser
youre genuinely wrong last comment saying want win game 15 point people saying literally team would biggest rival
dont agree last comment particular bergvall 6 month look completely different thats year maddison lead better year seems understand role team especially midfield issue defense year along audacious investment levy yet much ange even player made mistake also top paragraph sound like 2010s thats got u historical norm tottenham 4th fantastic spur fan doesnt happen lot dont daft
httpswwwtransfermarktcompremierleagueeinnahmenausgabenwettbewerbgb1plus0idsasasaison_id2020saison_id_bis2024natposaltersklassew_sleiheintern0 spending worse arteta took since spent less money still improved massively regressed
id rather u strive currently best europa league team unfortunately
oh shut fuck know shit dont need holier though barcelona cunt chiming
son miss traumatic moment
happens priority wanting arsenal lose wanting club well
well actually biggest reason didnt finish 4th ended 2 point behind villa theyd theyd ucl year instead
youre rewriting history would one thing look bright side least lose arsenal wont win people actively cheering u lose foul lame as rotten shit ange right criticize especially semblance happening within club
fan stadium poznan losing bit different seeing positive bad situation
spur fan werent pozman stand man city scored cant frame oh well least arsenal wont win weak as spur fan elsewhere internet begging loss

completely ignore wage
weve replace deadwoood thats around since 2018
want u strive dont see levy seems willing invest enough fighting europe expects manager push player beyond
spent load post 2015 flop transfer pretend didnt
arsenal winning title big deal played hand well worth random valiant victory mean nothing team isnt consistently agree lost city arsenal dont win title
saying tottenham losing reigning champion reason didnt qualify champion league opposed fact 3 last 10 pl game certainly opinion
youre true hater wouldnt understand
thats 3 drunk fan lmao
disrespect side pretty consistently springing upset recent year crazy spur putting absolute stinker norway massive possibility maybe even expected way theyve performing
win europa make champion league doesnt matter finish point
bro italian cant understand
got cl football similar wage spur number could find
make sound like didnt load deadwood well difference since arteta came costly flop
unlike chelsea dont get bailed billionaire owner prem team like entitled child
youre one said zero bearing though lol isnt true bearing wasnt main reason reason
watch match close getting point
forgot population makeup youre attempting reasonable
mean never getting champion league football villa finished 2 point ahead lost final game season palace game could least put pressure villa need win game dont start rewriting history
dont think sentiment saw majority spur fan one thing making best loss sentiment wanted lose happy something coach serious player would ever want see
club shit part fan occur
lmaoo mad call arsenal fan cry seems like youre one rattled mate
look emotional mate
tottenham winning trophy let realistic shouldve gone considering genuine possibility relegation one point
16th
understand cause live football club area europe city rivalry affect life city completely stop team win big trophy constant back forth football rival cause live like still bitching domestic cup 12 year ago cause final rival
exactly lol arsenal starting line today 34 starter 2021 people acting like arteta inherited squad
youre wrong barca using academy choice otherwise buying player twice actual worth
like raindrop responsible tsunami logic go teaam 20 point last 20 game go beat champion dont exact reason didnt qualify champion league ignore pumped 3 0 fulham home definitely failing beat man city meant spur didnt get cl football
thars point point point wouldnt enough
villa lost game 50 palace ended season unbelievable form there good chance villa wouldve crumbled pressure ucl football lost anyways
villa ahead whole time laid last match cl sewn already would actually tried palace didnt clinch tottenhams loss v city palace absolutely scorching time tbf debatable villa would able pick required point trying
im saying theyre 100 gon na win theyre favorite going semi final sacked summer europa final line
would better finish 5th play cl 16th win europa win europa give shit finish got thing top 5 club besides liverpool trophy
weve spent lot huge money influx chelsea constantly pulling money as saying management competent let compare club owned billionaire v member billionaire safety net dont struggle
theyre europa final im saying theyre 100 gon na win hmmm
5th get cl year youre right league cup way european final would huge doesnt buy back enough favor give ange another year managing u would make season successful even atrocious league form

always hilarious seeing big 6 fan complaining woe period time broadband readily available could keep leeds league 1 fucking teletext
relative though could say wednesday fan never suffered theyve never relegated football league like club dont know good etc etc
exactly remember arsenal relegation nearly went business repeatedly sell best player never sniff european football never mind trophy poor poor arsenal constant suffering arse
get youre saying probably said truth perspective come team result v expectation expectation arsenal bottom half team arent going probably end miserable
never get poetic honest choose without anyone asking one successful club whole world moment barca madrid manchester arsenal milan whatever even relative crisis thats obviously 00001 top world lol act like theyre carrying cross completely free time starting stopping completely inconsequential also completely unrelated life nothing actually happens whether team far away win game nobody world get anything devoted fan gigantic global brand even one cent cultural change there completely effect like literally something choose fun nothing else struggle taking even remotely seriously fan local amateur 5th tier club thats family club closest place living thing like yeah kinda get acting like theyre something someone decided follow arsenal im supposed impressed amazing sacrifice team champion england yeah dont get
neville still recovering
understandable kid fall love player manager henry made entire generation love arsenal
youre wrong make sense player kid fall love course wenger built team brought henry specifically kid grow idolizing player henry biggest arsenal
mean fan growing looked henry player
yeah henry far famous made whole generation arsenal fan
henry reason im arsenal fan remember scoring insane flick goal v west ham kid
ikr even though arsene wenger founded club
favoured ref funny one god wish could weve lost league title corrupt cunt rest say somewhat understand grievance guess
literally child starving africa logic
weird comment
he literally talking football team dude example literally nothing alike manufactured outrage people love offended sake
ive thought couple time season league campaign gone rail ive come conclusion isnt big arewhere league matter whether team getting better worse one going southampton season fan despair going yeah could oldham cheer spoiled cunt
suffering feeling suffer knowing team better used better havent anything long time still compete decent heartbreak suffering getting close
also worth noting part team showed flash brilliance even broke trophyless drought never actually league imagine feel personal even great career postarsenal make
like said really pl fan general
fuckin eh
yeah little bit smaller potato would hope could perspective
nah id obviously give spur
check arsenal nobody

much content consumed make parallel
really doesnt
think wrong german lehmann sent racist whatsapp message chainsawsaw axelike make better lol ive heard first part unless something else came light since last heard lehmann
getting sent 18 minute champion league final 2006 arsenal v barcelona
isnt one possessing cp metzelder
lehmann didnt possess anything nature
cut slack literally ignorant
redditors try understand humor thats high bar youre setting mate
youre absolutely right saw real madrid fan talk suck havent champion league every year suddenly understood look small club defence there way could local millwall fan bermondsey far brown
always love act like relate havent trophy year
also supporting tranmere rover everton liverpool doesnt make jesus christ choice
understand eg united fan might complain mid table bottom half finish absolutely cant stand fan big club complain disappointing season even still make european footy
dont even go far back honest remember listen pirated bbc newcastle radio stream pepe fm championship game broadcast game couldnt even listen bbc newcastle without actual fm radio wasnt broadcast bbc site
wednesday fan dont constantly talk terribly longsuffering though like bolton blackburn myriad club whove spent year away station accustomed particularly big club phenomenon
eat caviar everyday difficult return sausage arsene wenger
relative club became used certain standard wouldnt accept going level two know line feel repeatedly sell best player 15 year straight whilst still trying compete club buying decade 04 title spent less even always hear stingy ashley budget whilst trying compete trophy isnt exactly easy wenger worked miracle
well third point much true arsenal time tbf
yes 20082013 close able cover wage sell best player ill tell banter year fun finishing second three year row im guessing youre mostly younger fan still cant believe post serious club truly bounced back
thankfully able buy way top flight football otherwise know would happened remained sixth division 2 edit downvoted light humour really thinskinned
top 6 fan end miserable connection club 90 fan online success doesnt happen theyve got nothing left world would better place people would shut time time respectfully
way traumatic jamie carragher say want carragher definitely bad point know ball honest career he perhaps bit selfdeprecating dont make 700 appearance liverpool youre bad player open playing weakness jamie carragher said multiple time prospect facing henry would keep night hed go game henry hoping embarrassed
danny mill
poor neville losing one title arsenal 98 must really keep night settle check note eight others
clearly didnt watch football neville stuck pires henry stayed cb
player henry stayed medium bergkamp vieira pires etc tony adam really whole back line later fabregas etc
partly true kid loved lot pl player also saf mourinho wenger
especially foreign fan
compared non sky six
youve lost league title due form nothing cant accept youll never win
except football team winning trophy
example highlight scale difference arsenal top 1 football club england theyre talking constant suffering bro
ill happy tenth next season surely
genuinely asking anyone mentioning someone else worse changed mind perspective something always deadend argument
able understand obviously hope one thing thing obviously barcelona beat inter
episode brickleberry awesome
speak trouble
lehmann sent racist whatsapp message chainsawsaw axelike make better lol wait
youre right also wasnt axe lehmannd case chainsaw
learning lot today
right wish team tranmere rover
doesnt youre bolton support man utd say nobody worse u fa cup champion european semifinal insane ridiculed
family support actually grow around choice dont choose football club
disappointing relevant expectation understand say city fan disappointed season went said nobody worse u complain tough city fan theyre insane
talk massive brilliant time
particularly big club phenomenon whats big club relative even football pretty sure there load football fan tired english football club fan talking like pl matter ultimately medium size fanbase blow thing obviously youre going see like bolton blackburn fan little moan day day social medium aftvstyle meltdown dont make great clickbait
thats issue relative club dont suffer equally frequent disappointment constant pain
werent guy relegated either way
aware henry came arsenal 99 right
aimed attitude towards arsenal playing day
henry drifted left link pires cole lot rarely stayed upfront may want rewatch match confidently stating thing
like idea thing standing arsenal title reddit user durantsthegoat admitting still lose far many game run end season
ive already accepted well never win whilst pgmol charge mean seriously dont even watch pl game anymore highlight point taking league seriously see team treated differently others
he exarsenal player ordinary fan shit he going feel lot emotionally plus regardless good team tell watch single match without emotional rollercoaster oh fuck oh fuck win oh god shit yay id ask youd even watched match every single fan go top club even local amateur team rollercoaster part parcel football fandom
yeah plenty time something isnt meaningful correct assertion someone saying least iphone complain politics western country dumb hell sport much different cup tea
called german pundit token black guy led fired role hertha berlin term roofing incident first day trial lehmann admitted entered garage chainsaw hand argued coincidental carrying time said couldnt remember much else incident oh sorry officer ive idea tree fell local man said holding chainsaw sawed roof beam garage jens
come mate weve sent racist whatsapp two three
unfortunately
guess sort opposite problem
make argument club level point stupid club worse arsenal arsenal fan cant complain right complain compared club thats never made professional division stopped existing due financial struggle
20th chelsea 19th relegated imo either 1 2 relegation 14 chelsea spur relegated would reasonable also 106 year ago one personal stake history
like entire fanbase
something isnt meaningful correct assertion pointing someone else worse logical fallacy conclusion someone else worse related way situation entirely different premisse plus legit argument inverse would legit argument well wich mean could simply point real madrid start yapping bad well
im sorry fuck lost mind something always racist nutcase
narrow eye lehmanns general direction
arsenal fan top 1 regularly watch team win major trophy compete european football never faced relegation get watch best player world team another level privilege importantly many fanbases act like supporting team constant suffering many act like theyre victim english football obviously arsenal allowed complain moan act like constant suffering ridiculous
nobody say arsenal fan cant complain
yeah doesnt really matter end came back soon
missus never listened yelling tv screen effect must face incontrovertible proof
disagree
he always hothead field similar oliver kahn well someone know would say otherwise never came across anything im unsure always smart enough say private never left room
never met keeper
lost mind something magic
logic west ham newcastle fan 1 watched team win trophy arent allowed moan club meeting expectation surely see silly also professional footballer played arsenal saying usual arsenal fan think people taking far literally probably mean emotional rollercoaster every football fan watching team play go week week isnt stronger emotional bond club ordinary fan man tearing leaving arsenal
exactly killerarguments logical fallacy designed end conversation argument denying statement argument validity without engaging factual level feel free elaborate kind argument progress discussion add anything content layer
logic west ham newcastle fan 1 watched team win trophy yep ever catch saying constant suffering feel free tell shut
well exwest ham player teared leaving club there anyone get say loving club constant suffering anyone who actually left blood sweat tear club question sure bit eyerolling fan people acting like szczesny random hobo street

according salarysportcom raphina get 10 million dollar year salary additional commercial fee excluded cant imagine like feel tempted earn triple
mpabbe read funny lol
thought far saudi club offered large wage transfer fee havent outstanding outside 90m per transfermarkt neymar seem fairly line player would cost transferring european side yes there plenty big fee besides 1 none seem unusual glance even near psg buying mbappe neymar level wage separate matter
saudi buying u going younger player struggling break first team honestly potential saudi player dont seem like player want actually go
lol tebas doesnt care team isnt real madrid fact hoping olmo would accept offer another club order fuck club finance thats reneged much registering player authority first time either thing gavi long history trying fuck barcelona funny actually talk getting along florentino never see trying fuck real madrid refusing register player refusing accept say concert money part ffp calculation sold stake medium right six street dear buddy tebas middle fucking season rushed change law order count asset sold part ffp margin specifically fuck barcelona also said player valuation tried register joao felix 400000 year counted 4 million euro year didnt want club making creative accounting finance hasnt said shit madrid concert cancelled

teammate szczęsny retired instead going saudi
there error translation best would anyone say wouldnt go lying
redditors try understand context challenge impossible
yeah he calling liar
yeah didnt offer mbappe like billion per year something crazy like
think towards average joe fan criticises player
word could left offer came different moment career golden ball contender context leaving saudi obviously drop high value high profile player thats many refuse since theyre still top exactly raphinha
raphina video say wont go immediately telling u anyone say wont go lying im sure he got best assessment situation
guy already millionaire tell money offering could change life better believe lol
get absolutely hate people label generational wealth guy already generational wealth insulting like u peasant hearing put way
hey captain hendo went start conversation lgbt right activism money drove decision

saudi issue always european getting mad best player leaving league
agree
people would choose make lot money without much work thats unrealistic unless youre certain gender saudi league like fan football player dont overexert make good money
know say thing player brazil leaving country top club waste career playing fucking wolverhampton money talk
dont think chelsea fan gone know russia aint bad better start going due roman owning club however favourite player saudi either force go want watch boycut sport love

kdb said people said twerking saudi lol
different 10m give 5m tax free yield hundred thousand year make 5 year issue dont accumulate wealth player blow money 50m tax free yield 7 figure per year life changing since per fewer year
theyre real hero
going drive 3 ferraris time
going 200k per week 2 mil per week huge difference
never understood reddit take like u literally heard player saying life changing youre still arguing obviously think going 200k per week 2mil per week massive idk randos reddit 50k per annum try justify isnt
career end like fair like normal 9 5 spent whole livelihood react point get monies much set family future
job make money retiring everyone play love game alone
dont know didnt receive amount money rest life may gotten injury shortened career prevented stable finance family may live 60 year care family possibly facing illness require significant expense anything happen

dont understand moral highground playing saudia arabia middleeast country matter argument going ml scrutinized much country leader bad people funding genocide staying premier league united kingdom built back south east asia countless colony oh unwavering support nation commiting genocide moment please tell moral highground come
say citizen example pay universal basic income possible exploiting massive migrant population there lot people west right whod agree idea two tier society citizen top
leader saudi bad people theyre despotic ruler sold country natural wealth benefit thats like u right uk isnt far away property london owned become safe money launderers world spend money dont try get high horse
real benefit become local center fotball add economic activity outside oilgas longterm goal
saudi country hasnt done morally
actually good reason taking bag
isnt 10x normal salary change thing material reality life going 10m 100m year doesnt buy bigger house faster car nicer holiday better school kid nicer meal less financial stress etc go 50k 500k entire life change even though 450k extra isnt case 10m 100m
la liga buy far less bundesliga serie lol sure ligue 1
paid 18m got 60m two year later wanted go keeping wasnt really option great u nobody expected get level first year barca getting rid
dont pretend dumbass cant read bait rage he basically saying people say money influence decision lying ivan toney jhon duran situation nothing play would moving
would love see sub moral high ground meltdown dont enough rgunners already
easy moral place like saudi whats wrong theyre good country
raphinha cl la liga big chance ballon dor bro im first plane flying saudi
youre joking right whole concept plain stupid pro footballer refuse offer ml worth hundred million dollar u country moral value id ridiculed iraqi u done far damage country saudi arabia ever still paying action two decade later daily basis kurdish person also boycott premiere leage well brutally suppressed nationalist movement early 20th century occupied iraq find argument pro football league bringing politics fyi hate everything state saudi arabia represents way ever condone behavior seems bit funny people talk human right expect footballer pick weight geopolitics shoulder
love standard redditor posture bullshit like theyd take moral high ground instead 50 million year
would gladly give job saudi pay less im currently getting
youd leave planet earth unfortunately right country either funding genocide turning nazi fascist hellhole permitting slavery using migrant pawn etc etc
guy live high life career short mention tax 200k 400k tax free
meaningless older short read jon ronson great piece ago short version whatever level youre see thing next couple level want thing selfish arent imagine able call upon best doctor surgeon world family member got sick
probably people living extreme poverty think people developed country making 50k v 100k year
youre thinking spending come place like brazil chance large family lack opportunity experience extra 200k game changer
saying arent making 200k week would priority would take money question asked problem survive month made 200k week problem would make
dont want offend anything old bro money never buy happiness know raphinha said video money would set family life wife see offer like least doesnt cross mind lying true millionare guy young bunch arab ask would want come saudi arabia become 50x 100x richer wouldnt even consider raphinha probably goal win trophy like cl wich probably highest get actually admirable see south american player good resolve need remember lot south american player come hard place able help friend family grow mean lot
tbh extra 200k money could support decent living whole extended family life thats probably footballer would thinking
like would idea living either salary like
agree nobody need 200kweek difference 400k 200k isnt meaningless thats putting multiplier shit ton money especially consider poverty raphina described coming idk charitable he anything like sadio mane funding ubi senegalese village year make sense guy accept godfather offer play outside europe hell even want keep family secures multiple generation wealth dont want player quality leave saudi prime cant deny difference 10m 20m per year staggering amount money
meaningless clearly everyone going saudi raphinha speaking way towards offer statement reflect reality
depends many mouth feeding im talking kid get might feel like owe lot lot people
mean relative assuming youre uk person 3rd world could well say thing salary
try earn much absolutely big boost circumstance especially living wealth level begin rich want get richer honestly think 100 subreddit would jump
actually different way 400k month 200k
given stature conservative guess offered quarter billion quid 34 year tax free even make 10mil year barca thats still life changing dont think going stainless steel patek white gold one thats going set comfortable life invest appropriately total financial freedom generation descendant mention genuine power wish wield
let u know youre position stick ground turn
people adjust lifestyle fit income doubling salary life changing definitely meaningless whether go 5k 10k month 200k 400k per week
always money sponser orphan kid poor background university build school hospital neglected area even personal level kid future grandkids money buybuild company build house etc world never run problem solved money
people understand many player especially non western european country earning big buck mean able support family entire community back home well many family community someone knowfrom town making big may hope better life earning 200k may mean take care family well earning 400k may mean kid hometown get new football field academy better chance succeed especially true many brazilian player
absolutely earn amount 10 year dont care anyone say opposite direction given choice would hard turn 400k

10m figure specifically believe come robeyn ingrids book limitarianism httpswwwpenguincoukbooks451473limitarianismbyrobeynsingrid9781802060478 one would incentive work save anything could debate feasibility morality idea specific limit till blue face thats fine incredibly common capitalist dogma weird billion people lived hundred thousand year without possibility ever wealth anywhere near 10m well almost guess incentive work think people create thing wan na become filthy rich others get trampled machinery allows billionaire still work since incentive work must already run year ago
maybe maybe people would turn attention helping less able fortunate v hoarding wealth society money food currency someone hoarding food others starved would revolution quickly dont see money much differently
one would incentive work save anything yes would still live full life
people working without sniff chance getting 10m nonexistent
people sub completely touch sometimes
whats sad
definitely different might call name difference obvious also mentioned specific stuff like buying club reach 99 rich athlete moved ignoring logic id argue amount money footballer hoard career alone could already called greedy
maybe pool size raphinhas house pool obviously futile example club major league example investing brand etc there lot stuff becomes available easier money
think there difference either lack imagination knowledge money buy
mean many guy come play europe anyways wont make bank sure enough money live comfortably
ah see thanks
whats averagemedian end playing regularly make past 1st 2nd short contract
course money rebuild entire community came building new school community center sport field etc
point wed start discussing exactly life style mean pointless ultra rich live different life style millionaire raphinha doesnt live mansion jay z accept there reason pretend ungodly amount money wouldnt make difference someone life even already rich
bad person personally im pretty tired seeing individual 200k saying need 400k salary lock generational wealth great grandkids eta symptomatic modern capitalism salary ever large enough amount wealth ever enough even billionaire
current wage hell yeah would id already long career earning 200k chance cheer
nah really possible value success meritocracy also problem enormous wealth inequality
point im making thing money buy change life certain point going 20 50 bedroom house doesnt change life owning 500 rather 50 car doesnt change life 50 extra diamond rolex doesnt change life owning jet flying rather chartering doesnt change life etc etc etc
really sure probably research number find nba youre drafted first round sign deal two year team option pick next two year top player sign 45 year extension average player sometimes sign long deal like time 12 year deal using celtic example top 89 guy actually play playoff 34 year deal 10 year career edit meant salary depends lot recently changed recent cba lot solid starter making 20 mil year there bigger split star everyone else even youre making league minimum 10 year thats plenty retire youre idiot money vet min roughly mil year think
yeah get fake greedy awful disgusting wanted say merely wanting money isnt bad thing context decides weather bad
whatever earn probably someone feel way feel 200k guy might get bonus spend rim someone looking might ask excess perfectly good rimsyou roof head kid safe secure etc person may feel like extremely dire strait youre wasting resource value could new rim add life context think others pointed
guy projecting get promotion double wage remember tell bos
200k endpoint whats special figure
promotes wealth equality moving money saudi person favela brazil spend brazilian
yearly raise also fundamentally change life still like everyone else people always like matter level

wrong decision tbh
madrid player 100 red sadly
two portion
cry wolf get many privilege la liga
horrible many lmao
actually embarrassing surpassing arsenal liverpool come ref decision
problem swarm ref 68 instead prepping kick
correct im wrong di maria alaba decision cl semifinal year ago make thatstützhand idk english version term foul anymore seen la liga happening time season without penalty shout
complain fair question whether dogso
fuck red lol even last personclear scoring chance
wasnt clear goalscoring opportunity two defender closing
would red
dogso
three player
rule
way rudiger yellow card yet
2 player covering never getting red card
he th last man yellow correct call
opportunity score didnt though yellow
would red
red
blind wasnt last man clear yellow
2 player covering close play correct decision
even close
like mbappe got 1 match ban trying break someone leg please stop lying stop
watching game
yup comparing tv money big 3 rest league alone creates big gap
think u mostly fan particularly online one player dont usually behave like lol
yeah netherlands call steunarm
fair question given he got shot definition cant denying obvious goalscoring opportunity reckon yellow perfectly fine
sure question quickly realise accept there one call yellow correct
cant serious
think know mean
doesnt necessarily last man red
he goal thats denial goal scoring opportunity mbappe seems ahead barcas defender lol
literally clear goal scoring opportunity
wouldnt clear great chance score denied pen
one stopping shot likely gon na goal talking lol
rule exactly
player getting yellow happens time dont see thats relevant
thats work lol
fouled shot
ref judge whether player goal enough declare dogso mbappes pace there good argument goal scoring opportunity de jong interrupted full shooting motion
real madrid red real madrid yellow
fantastic tactical foul tbf
isnt neccessarily last man
denied clear goal scoring opportunity
arent covering shot lol pause mbappe shooting free shot goalkeeper edge box clear goalscoring opportunity
let gooooooooooo keep cry bit h
wish could money
yes behave like
thats criterion criterion four d distance offence goal general direction play likelihood keeping gaining control ball location number defender red card mean
technically argue chance could even concrete despite getting shot think end day foul clear dogso regardless red given
call clearly get shot getting pulled ball leaf foot shoulder like 50cm ground
youre saying like player get watch replay like u lol definitely wasnt dogso see player mightve thought onfield perspective
right wasnt clear scoring chance either curbasi
exactly mbappe ahead every defender cubarsi cover half angle goal
na curbasi would caught
cant deny obvious goalscoring opportunity opponent opportunity score goal basically
covering defender one unless want claim like million red card missed year someone fouled tomid shot
denied goalscoring opportunity got shot
yeah got shot meaning cant denial obvious goalscoring opportunity
atleast two barca player mbappe goal absolutely clear goal scoring opportunity know real fan dont really know rule favor putting pressure ref instead please stop posting nonsense atleast
thats rule work last man foul player one near sent two player getting back beyond foul close play red card presence two player meant red card ever going shown
32 keep cry bit h
cry lmao lettttt go
started cry first place lmao
get real madrid hierarchy
four criterion come play considering whether situation dogso situation definition cant dogso opportunity score goal taken case
shot obvious goal scoring opportunity unless gk way position
aye definition cant denying goalscoring opportunity opportunity still taken
im sick set fan right lol half aiming people turned sub game lmao
there way cubarsi getting mbappe get shot see ref didnt go red given game going dogso isnt clear 5050 call
exactly mbappe ahead every defender cubarsi cover half angle goal right thats mistake thats denial goal scoring opportunity still
dont matter gon na catch mbappe clear direct sight goal even managed get shot fouled thats clear denial goal scoring opportunity
free kick thats vast majority free kick dont end goal
doesnt matter wouldnt
lol got fouled middle shooting motion
dont think thats rule mate
uppercut though still red card even though said wasnt possible checkmate atheist
thats incredibly incorrect two player close wont impact shot
yes thats rm complaining think dogso isnt based criterion listed pushed balance scuff foot ground ball never million year could say getting shot
still fair player question
think still look extra space thered dribble get closer shot example
make zero sense cant get proper shot entire body balance literally get fouled quite literally prevented taking shot proper fashion exact foul called
arguing lol
sure cant say 100 know whats correct call one tbh pretty chaotic around maybe red card later pen two way lol
obvious goal scoring opportunity goal scoring opportunity
mbappé shot ie goalscoring opportunity foul cant preventing
would
mean youre free look far understand themhttpswwwthefacomfootballrulesgovernancelawsandruleslawsfootball1111law12foulsandmisconduct quite literally cant sent dogso youre preventing goalscoring opportunity de jong didnt
cant interpret mbappe shoot ran couple yard least cubarsi getting across youre getting red card time player close play beyond foul happens also shot outside box clear goal scoring opportunity
understanding rule
definition isnt
lot ifs thats dogso
think many time attacker dont get take exact shot want defender spacetackling thempushing themblocking themslides themwhatever else happens couple time game least especially corner right theyre dogso attacker still get shot one wanted foul de jong dogso mbappé still get chance score
thats different guy
got fouled
yes fouling making clear goal scoring opportuntiy denial therefore red
yes theyre close enough impact play case arent irrelevant clear goal scoring opportunity free shot goalkeeper
explain im wrong citing rule cant wont
obvious player
dont think thats rule mate
close enough play said two touch mbappe would give cubarsi enough time get across
clear goal scoring opportunity free shot goalkeeper sentence right completely wrong educate dont ask people cite rule literally common knowledge
people he last man basically first thing rule qualify
he denying clear opportunity fouling kick ball go doesnt mean anything lmao
yes clearly isnt taking two touch im glad agree cubarsi isnt going impact
free shot edge box within penalty area clear goal scoring opportunity explain clear goal scoring opportunity cant say educate cant ask people educate explaining using law game lmao
thinking last man necessary show one understanding rule
definition cant deny goalscoring opportunity opportunity taken

breaking news water wet congrats celtic
boring league existance
ranger always seem way stronger celtic europe dont know 4 ranger aka terror getafe europe dangerous team meet europe fact many team like play cause hardcore team even shithoused way europa league final taking big team way 3 season ago developed bit reputation last 23 season remember game spur league phase season playing new brand hardcore football could see spur player intimidated ball tackle everywhere
wow unbelievable
celtic fan rate brendan rodgers
worse farmer league
congrats celtic isnt easy trust know
legit question winner scottish league get play epl would neat
win jd cymru premier title
agent phone total network solution speak
really good season great signing u
derry city sligo rover island
theyre tied ranger 55 league title strictly speaking ranger 54
ranger tribute act
think kolo toure still hold best record 2 invincible season arsenal celtic
he wing
everytime he ball know there gon na goal he superstar portugal
great moment think need proper preseason get back speed
playing great stuff europe done heavy lead league
football dire time there solid chance highest scoring league season history show high standard
quite remarkable celtic caught look league tally circa 2000 could easily league 03 05 11 dominated even
scary far truth comment many people agree
next faroese
play attacking progressive football player signed purpose mean come europe especially ange naive ranger past year pragmatic helped europe hurt domestically id argue though season weve shown ability mix pretty good campaign narrowly missing knockout v bayern last minute hopefully next season progression
theyre built play without ball built play mean try go toe toe team europe 10x budget get scudded big improvement year though
celtic play ucl ranger europa league plus celtic european cup verge best scottish team metric
ranger shit whenever theyre playing thursday night
celtic stronger squad done comfortably decade stronger squad always win league ranger arent even good cup team contrary europe theyve 2 trophy last decade one league theyve got european juju reason
last time ranger played cl worst team competition history
dont think fan basketball team would know much rodgers
he quite obviously step everyone else league set standard style domestically effective improves player abilitiesmentality suit effective style he also arrogant narcicist poor transfer record belief deserves mixing football elite general football philosophy heavily influenced elite mean well continue dominate domestically anything particularly interesting europe ultimately leave behind squad worse state inherited
2nd best manager modern celtic history behind mon extends continues achieve u potential go ahead
bit downgrade quality style play ange player immense world like kyogo ccv played less like world beater came he still kept team tight playing well good result europe year refreshing gave bayern run money despite kompany fumbling club
love brendan
dont really want see celtic play overcommercialised super league
theyre scottish zero overlap english football berwick ranger aside
aberystwyth calling
theyll dancing street tonight
one best shot stopper ive ever seen live save ive seen man extraordinary
seems signing exman city keeper looking one last hurrah success general
ranger died
celtic 13 last 14 league
world schmeichel
paulo bernardo really thought going season
european performance fantastic season sometimes league football dire
quality spfl maybe performance inconsistent given best season europe
sine 2000 celtic 19 title 90 aside celtic dominated scottish football since 60 infact youd need 70 80 celtic dominated lifetime unprecedented
think change format european competition helped match fewer match dead rubber effect outcome either team celtic getting regular experience playing team resource rather thrown deep end couple time season
already trophy 2 thats without going ranger many
really screwed u orlando last night
he better ange ange spent shit load get celtic playing way rodgers onto 4th treble 4 full season
dont think ange get result brendy got europe one big red mark anges celtic cv playing scott bain v hibs giving lee johnson win celtic two result performance bodo glint real hard one take celtic ange wanted
rodgers league ange
thanks responding instead downvoting idk kind opinion genuinely asking
could say scotland
love
quality bring stick experience leadership think bring prem national team important
dont get point ranger died narrative celtic fan guessing windup dont seem like type fan think title attached llcs ccorps rather fanbases
started season well showed lot maturity covering dm role mcgregor injured around october experience going attacking role dropping back holding role really helped oriley grow player couple season ago cover mcgregor way think say lot rodgers opinion bernardo trusted role midfielders think exercising versatility stage career pay dividend longterm injury came bad time bit late get back speed claim starting spot there 5 game left including cup final dont see rodgers moving away settled midfield 3 least final hatate likely away summer 3rd midfield position alongside mcgregor engels become lose hell tough competition mccowan whoever bring replace hatate mind cant tell im big fan haha hope hell kick next season
brush decade like nothing ever happened
mean celtic scottish cup ucls ranger used league title dont
recency bias tottenham shit bias
see love playing celtic especially cl night parkhead he absolutely beaming ynwa great spot really doesnt anything prove still competing top level team cl enjoy
need anything windup
main gripe celtic fan make ranger distance debt racked old company wilful negligent spending argue shouldnt face consequence different company get keep trophy spending club
dont get lot ranger died narrative celtic fan well club went bust went business wouldnt make fun biggest rival going bust business
funny innit
httpswwwtheguardiancomfootball2024apr16arkadagturkmenistanalhilalworldrecordfootball worth read anyone like world football
turkmenistan isnt real
fair enough
thats default greece way club go bankrupt get relegated lower division form new company erase debt keeping history aek aris panionios iraklis many smaller club done im pretty sure club italy done something similar
thought wind though youre serious
well fair enough thats greece cant financially irresponsible
liquidated deid
serious obviously seeing celtic fan hate ranger much last one mean accept continuity still decent point allowed think club spiral debt shrug new company start
fan perspective yes 100 fan shouldnt punished poor managment shouldnt shoulder burden history poor managment
irresponsible avoiding responsibility people owed money
fan shouldnt punished poor management shouldnt shoulder burden history poor management ranger fan actively cheered ceo david murray piled debt quote every five pound celtic spend spend ten course also cheered sold club craig whyte 1 believed medium report craig whyte wealth radar cough didnt really wealth radar cough nbsp ranger fan always reminded cheered along happily davey murray racked debt killed club

finishing year mate start yapping like know youre borrowed time question whether levy week spur get final bottle
man mentally checked he hanging sweet sweet severance bag
friendly reminder ange 23 last 61 pl game
world hysteria team narrowly missed champion league football last season whole new heap money spent sat 16th league lost half game like justified

well youve charge 2 season least half time probably longer include capitulation back half last season disaster know spur lot injury issue still theyd injury 1013th youd go fair enough hit hard wrecked season west ham three truly dire promoted side pitiful amount theyve spent
cant believe season spur claim always win trophy second season could still come true
honesty hilarious spur end winning el season
levy kind pay cruel point

last year story thats bad story today tenure disaster
youre one spot relegation ffs
finished fifth last year youre definitely finishing fifth year redemption ange could possibly going win europa league

going finish 5th bottom year
mate begging certain outcome every single time speaks
talk much
one enjoying interview late clear he also feeling done speaking mind know hell let go im waiting see say next
extremely weird negativity towards ange reddit whenever open month given shit he deal mention historic injury crisis im totally fine defending there every chance could adapted pragmatic injury wouldnt led u suffer much term result whole thing get player believe something requires lot bravery giving principle would stop progress long term player decide dont brave pressure whole thing fall apart get best player spine playing consistently playing football may able outperform bigger spender long term anyway moot point he probably gone dont kind defending he shown ridiculous amount disrespect deal crazy injury outside control
he lost plot
embarrassing behavior guy mask completely fallen
dude stfu isnt stunning argument think
tell he narcissist
excuse yeah 16th beyond ridiculous really check table every
mate
bingo u finishing anywhere 4th7th minimum acceptable season add cup run europe top dropping 5th 16th said good matter spin somehow win u el nice vacuum also paper abysmal league campaign
speak im big trouble utd fan
competitive 7th 8th less shameful decade ago easily put 6 7 good equallybetter resourced side
despite insane spending last year standard club fallen much lower 510 year ago
profitable football club world arent
par 67th spur look current resource potential rise coming year unless big change financial rule doesnt look unlikely year ago spur way higher 16th 7th would near impossible given injury season
still find insane never tried adapt run game find even weirder got much praise stubbornly sticking gun even though clearly werent working anymore unwillingness actually adapt tactic method new league always remain one baffling thing like saw exactly going wrong said yeah well like way playing come may ill stick
part dont get worried contes slot etc dont get wrong slot excellent year whole different thing building year year though good manager get lot team arrive great one get time go im pretty interested see happens liverpool next year could see getting much better signing ending relatively far pace
gave proper laugh gon na lie im shamelessly stealing using though came group chat
amazing think targetted fact probably given softest treatment english medium guy pedigree quite frankly landed bigger job cv justifies journos ex player pundit much harsher ten hag last season even amorim year anges struggle gone radar recently injury crisis deal sort softened narrative around spur
well press conference he literally talk answer question
youre going come stuff always win trophy second season cant start cry people criticise team 16th
cringe af hear grown men talk way went loving rolling eye every time whine new crap
im pretty amazed arent story coming player disliking
100 confirmed aussie
big part think conte trying get fired saying wild andor exaggerated stuff medium know writing wall could win europa league final 50 people would still doubting stage might well take payoff move
still remember anges quote posted every day everyone saying nice grounded obvious public personality trying build hard assume personality stressed
insufferable character football moment
finishing 5th last year wasnt good story 1st october great story title chase november good story falling incredible start clinging europa league spot another spur story
still people sub defending man ange around december realizing going accept public stoning every week fuck change anything
finishing fifth tottenham greatest achievement
bottled overtaking u despite winning villa park limped towards end season
bragging winning anything
kinda he eluding villa newcastle forest position season outstanding lauded tottenham pfft bragging 5th place
well see he talking tail end next season he still free hit time period
fairness injury season im first shit spur like narrowly missed title last season well pace pushing precisely injury context much worse would moaning lot injury talking 16th give ange easy instead talking spur form better 2nd half last season 28 pl game purple patch 12 win dissimilar 11 33 season shit without injury message
injury crisis least two starting cbs completely self inflicted he garbage amateurish manager whose past coaching experience australia japan
theyre 16th
spur reach el final sack ange classic levy style
call get rid ange didnt really intensify cupped hand away support either
im trying start shit really top 4 club given crazy team talking villa newcastle chelsea forrest like even u could easily slipped top 4 maybe even awful injury maybe top 4 would realistic current squad manager who one trick pony get punch weight
especially see level side like wolf relegation territory 3 brazil international
newcastle resurgence 5 team easily better right liverpool city chelsea arsenal newcastle spur fighting manu 5th6th spot shitting bed badly take team like villa occasional overachiever like forest equation 5 fighting 45 cl spot another 4 fighting rest elconference one finishing 7th8th shouldnt bad indictment certainly minimum
thought real
weirdly actually adapted game season man city away brentford away frankfurt away one remember play well get result next game go back default ange tactic put run loss
problem even baffling joined explicitly said outset came play certain way circumstance change time thought exactly conte used say australian accent tragedy waiting happen
hasnt hired calibre coach could help play another way theyre young inexperienced highest level
hell bbc contingent giggling like school child asking eth getting sacked right fa cup
reek imposter syndrome
exactly imagine klopp pep scrutiny would insane he babied comparatively enjoy tho fanbase root team lose nothing complain
show give bland answer make football talk obligation show talk whatever he saying last couple month
there difference answering question give auld shitty pr talk wont 19 club fan taking piss spur hating someone prized caring medium sure care lot
yes he willfully ignorant get 2630 first 10 game finishing 5th due midtable form going get lot praise prize 5th different
dont find insufferable eth infinite excuse anyone worse anges victim complex tiresome honestly bit sad
seems youre little obsessed buddy
nah form obviously tailed dramatically last season jumping 8th 5th without harry kane good story spur never chance winning league champion league spot always unlikely
well spur expected past 20 year
like spur considered bigger club
slight bit context around though isnt tottenham considered part socalled big six therefore expectation higher villa forest newcastle also top five season would mean instant champion league qualification whereas last season tottenham discovered throwing away chance top four
wage bill also 7thhighest league 5th slight overperformance definitely expected range
first three mentioned championship within last ten year forest third season back top flight spur champion league final season villa got promoted
there excuse finishing low theyre going though injury 8th sure
injury self inflicted manager ftfy
ahhh westham ruined
tell fan new manager announced right game mourinho return steve austin wwe style run tunnel onto pitch
goal disallowed minute later
think people fan moreso overestimate player quality wise lot kid potential excessive injury senior player romero maddison son bent biss either good bent biss inconsistent son romero maddison shouldnt 16th people saying 4th7th wouldve adequate whatever deluded ange ideologue manager pep ideologue manager set way philosophy require certain talent depth threshold perform according want without specific player quality depth fall apart ange isnt idiot weve mishired yet brought guy specific need team want pragmatist
maybe even awful injury awful league form
exactly people saying quality dropped dont clue many side good mateta finish level u midweek phenomenal obviously poor moment saliba pinging top corner like distance wasnt something mid table side forward habitually 10 year ago there pressure every game season big club isnt 7th 8th bottom half co everyone shoot past
quick glance table reveals 15 team easily better spur
dont people want honesty people press conference otherwise press conference pointless full diplomatic drivel im defending anges comment think bit limit desired honesty he dug enough reputational hole could probably pull back turn bland diplomacy
dont agree jumped 8th 5th narrative conte 4th left stellini mason dropped 8th ange didnt kane spend 270m europe contend finished 5th conte 4th kane also back 5 lloris perisic dier lenglet emerson anges back 5 vicario udogie vdv romero porro improvement back 5 compensates loss kane especially european football
isnt good story spur race cl spot missing never considered good season
ruinin
lot good young player unfortunate ange unraveling like looked like could one bring new generation forward
perception player often influenced much manager getting think another manager great youd rate player dont think would exceptional season spur finished 6th example
wow thanks chief never wouldve guessed know well talking
reddit wanting honesty people want honesty world still work like microphone say bland thing position word scrutinized get pr trained course reporter may like one less thing hang around head
saying back 5 compensates losing effective consistent striker league ffs adore bad take one cake eater
dont agree jumped 8th 5th narrative literally happened narrative
spur race cl spot bollock noone thought going last season serious season thats problem
spur fan come man serious club entire league except maybe city liverpool loses harry kane struggle massively sure lot resource one would think around battling wake man arsenal loses saka rice odegaard even saliba struggle liverpool loses salah van dijk theyre going struggle chelsea loses cole palmer would struggle newcastle lose anthony gordon alexander isak struggle massively 5th last year spur accomplishment season however unmitigated disaster
basis success comparing one two interim manager sure last full time manager spur 4th
lost eden hazard transfer ban finished top 4
also harry kane point
basis success taking team fell apart previous permanent manager spat dummy got sacked improving league position significantly despite greatest ever goalscorer sold summer comparing two interim manager conte fucking nonsense argument
hell team league every year guy fantastic squad would say thats outlier also one year spur finished lot even hazard best team
didnt improve league position conte team fell apart 4th ange improved league position significantly 5th youre going explain 5th significant improvement 4th
didnt improve league position conte conte sacked 28 game spur point 28 game last season contes team sacked team fell apart 4th ange improved league position significantly 5th fell apart finished 8th 28 game mean absolutely fuck talking

debuted 200910 correct thats like 1516 season total
basically every season full starter wasnt im ready football without
peak entire role named football manager
favourite player connection club legend
müller ever spoken developed game young age must made conscious decision develop skill winning ball back immediately playing perfectly weighted assist

littbarski first ever football hero
getting new contract bayern madrid modric keep renewing every year he still good enough
müller lewandowski legendary partnership
someone many assist goal would waste become coachmanager
least still götze germany bundesliga fan normally feel gotze still good bad feel like never hear nongerman nonbundesliga watcher

think youre misreading stat
also robben man
currently earns 20m per year hasnt regular starter basically 2 year he also 35 energy level nowhere near
he important playmaker season im pretty concerned end season without
germany bundesliga fan normally feel gotze hadnt scored world cup final goal probably wouldnt anywhere near type popularity he kinda fallen status bc never lived hype built think every bundesliga fan happy see he kinda recovered well frankfurt said think götze likely least generation witnessed go one impressive player theyve watched live peak may short lived impressive peak

bellingham clearly expecting ball played wide cross way would able get back onside hopefully get picked cross come since standing offside position prior seems like he frustrated teammate didnt catch
nasty nutmeg nasty
move escape press
heart skipped beat
could referee
madrid got ref head see reluctant give card
pedri he toying start damn bro
turn get rid pedri look like something zidane would tho
cant fathom people england thinking shouldnt build national team around bellingham
try get back onside lmao
pointed ceballos give outside ceballos smart obviously offside
nutmeg man
jude definitely one best madrid player today
rmtv omg bias referee check eye mate thats mile onside
closer expected tbh pas second late would inside martin tracing back
jude better
bro gassed 34 min mile offside wasted good position
bro thought scored
wouldve pretty goal really onside
bro
check var two penalty already
nasty
guess think thought ball would played wide line retreat playing onside one would cover offside often work could smart teammate could see offside
tired maybe seeing ran 100 yard
probably waiting cutback ball went wide
one dragging cubarsi corner one handball first
yes first cross towards box defender slide stopped ball hand penalty corner kick hit far post player wouldve chance tap ground tackled real madrid defender
1shirt tugging dragging cubarsi 2 rudiger kicked ferran back heel
handball never going given isnt supposed hand support
jovic got injured training apparently
everyone team selfish pas fucking ball
holy shit santi scored amazing assist amazing finish honestly
wanted ten goal bonus spirit tall king
come milan want parma stay
damn two close call venezia
would one funniest goal season abraham dribble actually led assist

cant believe guy calling shit last season fantastic finish
shot
reminder every rsoccer pundit saying enzo overrated racist cunt month ago
thats break drought keep one god damn
feel he best he instinctive like sometimes labour ball bit seemingly get head leading wrong decision he form much instinctively clinical like
could see taking near corner flag must huge relief
haha must heard talking shit past month great finish hopefully form improves last match week
he looked really good today played great ball top given u much tempo attack also important defensive bit
enzo well
say incredible tackle
thats fofana lot time earlier season maresca ball might one dimensional work work chalobah might might one suited position need another fast paced front foot left cb since fofana made glass
movement dribbling passing make better striker since costa
nico heard talking shit
good scoring excellent goal let pretend he starved opportunity score dry spell he long long way clinical finisher he good progressing ball oftentimes struggle score lack finishing nuance platonic ideal confidence goal scorer sooner replaced better chelsea
lol ay 1 10 still 1 yeah
till nottingham play like till u
yeah name nicolas jackson
well theyve got racist part right
love couple minute later u commentator say pickford likely wished would done better dont think anyone saving
think everyone like confident
he injured past month recently returned thats bit harsh
shame hell considered pure profit summer
giroud pretty good well
hope come good becomes consistent fact could say whole team really
low bar tbh
copypasta lmao
given first goal 13 game he confident though
second year row defense dramatically improved team
chelsea challenging title pure profit chalobah isnt going elevate u
youre right really rated giroud
jackson better giroud giroud excellent fit otherwise hardworking front line havertz werner mount could put kind mile jackson
even madueke today example consistent really need make sure development never halt
still beat like falcao higuain morata thats big name
mon dieu ive deceived duped given runaround
higher ups care improving finance improving pitch
sure he best cb right make sense get rid
2 beyond washed moving chelsea money laundering player
really improving finance theyre selling player like buy player beyond requirement need sell
he really he awful match since he back feel like hell play awful wont hear he best cbs play well everyone back
think tongue cheek comment also add pato list
crazy falcao considered washed back next season frankly better mbappe breakout season played pivotal part monaco knocking city think chipping claudio bravo daily basis
he least bad one colwill number two maybe tosin three
yeah fair got wooshed
never player injury regardless keep mind came prem directly acl french farmer confidence massive thing seemed rediscover jardim monaco prime falcao would bag team league elite gunman
opinion doesnt make fact minus fofana relatively level preinjury badiashile showed chalobah ever recently also playing well tosin seems less low high chalobah low high colwill seems also low high idea make sense sell dont get though chalobah behind fofana injury issue seem behind acheampong keep targeting guy cover side also chose two lcbs round make sense

bro niemals ist da ein elfer der hsv bekommt den aufstieg geschenkt
hamburg zwölfter mann
wollt eigentlich sagen das die 96er heute gegen zwölf spielen aber mannschaft und fan halten gut gegen dennoch der fc braucht die drei punkte und gott segne marvin schwäbe der hat un bisher gerettet
damn match day
diese skykonferenzen sind verwirrend manchmal gibts extra konferenzkommentatoren manchmal glaube ich nicht mal da vielleicht aber auch nur bei dazn oder bei internationalen konferenzen kein plan aber meine da gab mal manchmal die kommentatoren der einzelnen spiele und ein metakommentator alles um geld zu sparen schätze ich aber wenn man die produktionsqualität von dazn und sky mittlerweile sieht kann man sich irgendwie nicht vorstellen das da auch nur ansatzweise nachhaltig gewirtschaftet wird
meisten für einen hsvaufstieg spricht derzeit das die mannschaften zwischen platz 3 10 viele punkte liegen lassen das man den eindruck gewinnt das keiner aufsteigen möchte andererseits wenn der hsv auch heute nicht gewinnt und weiter macht dann reicht e trotzdem nicht
dompe contract extension go
lou für deutschland
kurz n weg finden un zu ficken
ein geiles tor hahaha
theyre hamburging april cant believe eye
würde gerne wissen da überhaupt lange gecheckt werden musste vielleicht einfach nur übertriebene sorgfalt um einem wichtigen aufstiegsspiel nichts zu übersehen aber eigentlich war ja doppelt klar das da niemals abseits sein kann
wir müssen vorlegen aber wenn der hsv da noch choketjunge jungekriegen wir dann davie selke zurück
hsv hat eindeutig angst vor un anders kann man sich da nicht mehr erklären
hamburg spielt nur noch gegen team von unten den letzten 3 spieltagen also sollte e selbst mit einer niederlage heute eigentlich reichen da man wegen tordifferenz eigentlich 4 punkte vorne ist zum glück haben paderborn elversberg magdeburg und düsseldorf alle nicht gewonnen auf der anderen seite ist dieser verein mittlerweile einfach verflucht bzw die spieler haben eine mentaleblokade
vamos ksc dont let
elfmeterentscheidungen für und gegen den ksc den letzten paar monaten müssen untersucht werden
lol keep could chance promotion next year rate
team devision consecutive season among current team
bro denkt wir steigen auf haha
e hätte mich echt nicht gewundert
zahlung kam verspätet
warte erst bi du die ganze nächste woche die gleichen schon 100 mal gebrachten witze über den hsv lesen musst
dann mus er den elfer aber auch prüfen wir haben letzte woche 11 den selben elfmeter zurückgenommen bekommen 8 jahre und e gibt immer noch keine klare linie mit diesem dreck
yes theyve seven season
ich fühle eh nichts mehr von daher macht da nichts
joy immeasurable day saved
der hsv ist wie ein guter wein braucht einfach länger um nach oben zu reifen

bundesliga hit miss
dortmund hope international football next season stay alive
need see goalkeeper cam think really hurt badly time world get back goal couldnt
team gon na kill fan 4 sure
fucking way
never unclench dortmund lmao
obvious hoffenheim gon na concede defense hot garbage
duality man
rollercoaster emotion last 10 min
feel like eternity since last dortmund late winner
damn match day went crazy
bundesliga game quite fun
league ridiculous
foul tho
fucking game europe come
dortmund hot cold insane feel fan jfc gg
baumann look concussed thats bad call
nah know actually keeper could barely walk thats bit unfair
lol way allowed
give goal goalkeeper get taken chukwuemeka doesnt even touch ball
even get checked
gk palm ball away get cleaned foul thats scandalous
count
holy match today thats nut
ridiculous allow goal gk got kneed head
last minute goal
goal standing absolutely mind boggeling one care hoffenheim decision absolutely wild
im sure goal given tbh want dortmund win much next person chukwuemeka kicked baumann face inadvertently even
absolute fucken disgusting decision allowed play
niemals ein tor
goalkeeper got concussion definitely foul
mean absolutely give goalkeeper visibly stumbling back spot contact head could even 5050 still stop even mean keeper subbed
1st touch matter
really point var absolutely foul keeper
thank stuttgart
never want hear dortmund fan complain ref lmao
thats foul keeper clearly always cautious head injury
goal dortmund player saw keeper still going leg ball reckless play
fucking love league
looking remaining game wouldnt surprise made cl leipzig u quite hefty set game left
bauman died though
never doubt
yeah got hit dortmund player knee
yeah looked pretty
trying run back goal like zombie
bos music hear
dive ball normal collision
dive ball need play ball attacker get foul 1010 time play time
doesnt look like bad call look like keeper requires insane mfer
also way he holding neck seems like whiplash crazy team win dont feel good bvb everytime
5050 took risk get hit foot
wasnt kicked face gk stopped attacker foot knee bent landed gk head tripped
go ball touch exactly time point getting hit risk keeper take diving ball cant take win away keeper 2 second late clear ball first
one 5050 go way make year absolute disaster referee
joke comment countless moment champion league bundesliga ref disgraceful favour opponent also baumann get hit end play chuk baumann touched ball time collision occurred afterwards due keeper diving towards action risk keeper take
7 point go
anton didnt convert chance penalty cant post x link fucking reason ultra slow motion baumann touching ball going chukuwumekas foot stumble baumanns face someone got injured foul doesnt mean fault x handle crovek23 replied another german journalist wan na look
thats bit unfair tbf id give foul knee fucking face foul lol
yeah var
whoever get ball first right foul people late tackle lol
say leg breaker attacker got head ball
havent seen single replay dortmund player touched ball maybe im blind
yeah true go score offsite goal dont get called back proceed still cry ref jus tip iceberg dortmund well
4 point win
mean
chukuwumeka able play ball backwards reaching tight food direction corner must blocked ball way prior collision
watched show exact nonslowmo clip showed baumann hit ball left hand lower wrist clip chuckys foot clearly first even possible see whether chucky even touch ball idea else seeing
always knee face sometimes face knee
also knee face baumann hit chuks leg make bend hence knee hit face looked nasty though
nah really dont like dortmund standard clash dortmund player doesnt aim hit keeper little bit unlucky 100 goal book
nope touched ball exactly time point foul keeper dive leg play ball first thats risk take
sure see slow mo touch time
definitely look like chuk get slight touch ball tho think play
got ball got swept ensuing tackle fell head sure biased goalkeeper protected enough
mean dont still touching looked typical though baumann dived ball would expect go towards penalty spot unless dortmund player also touch
butthurt bremen fan lmao
well yeah still play leverkusen im counting 55 point enough u
think 55 point enough reach 4th place u better goal difference also relies game going favor
watch video sir basically baumann tripping chuku ball guirassy stop baumanns elbowsunderarm none touch ball ball contact baumann fucked chukus foot hand would penalty yellow card baumann
yeah idk really dont like goal fan
honestly still look thats biggest problem var ref day action full 5050 wouldnt swap ref aftermath baumann literally huge blast forehead well looking slightly affected maybe even really shortly knocked called yes even foul simply possible dangerous head injury overwrite everything else intention doesnt apply also often called foul dont get card would less talk well ref least look screen
really rule thought clear foul dortmund fan ill take tho
touching ball mean foul full shit
ah ok see mean ideally bayern title wrapped next week leverkusen less play toughest game sure
would kovač keep job case would like stay
watched perspective best impossible ball change direction like without hitting baumann
difference onpitch referee going watch screen make var already checked determined wasnt foul like point youre simply stopping game make look like something happening utterly pointless
ref communication var minute basically come touch ball first thats easily sth var handle
screen time var already told ref wasnt foul people would complain var case
get injured action doesnt matter foul coming late getting ball andor reckless behavior word kind action result action chukwuemekas action reckless baumann injured simply unfortunate
nope see var doesnt see clear mistake doesnt intervene
mean take risk cant really punish attacker baumann jump leg first hit similar timing noone talk
sliding keeper trying play ball tripped attacker keeper got first foul didnt dont get foul attacker hit keeper head near ground
keeper managed touch ball hand yes would considered foul simply 5050 unfortunately baumann didnt get ball hand
foul goalkeeper dive towards ball head right shooting motion striker becomes foul clear ball first still hit punish striker going ball
contract end next season regardless personally im good
likely case yes hed get summerwindow backing prove extend bit risky reactionairy manager market seem rough summer
true ive seen exact foul given countless time guess ref
rule also ref take break head injury watching baumann stumble box isnt good look
imagine scene suspends play dortmund shot empty goal dortmund fan would riot
ref see head injury ball woudl either go anton miss stop imagine interrupt play ref could never whistle dortmund match rightfully though
ref supposed tell real time pov saw clash signaled foul right call ball free baumann back foot ball played others side pitch shot goal ofc thats ref eye within 5 second cant blame ref supposed know
there seven professional bielbiennes squad like andorra beating germany making final
yb equalises last kick game goal disallowed
meet basel mean get qualification spot el
tf care
sadly winner get el qualification spot spot get passed onto next best team league rather loser final
tf comment something tell others dont care lmao thats real question

going ruin relegation battle
chance clip first yellow card plz cant find post one
many fucking red card season
bro shit today couldnt hang around playing footy day
smirking whilst walking absolute bellend
stupid already yellow
smiling walking
stupid cunt get skinned loos head already yellow
dont wrap arm around player like youre german suplex pretty fucking easy honestly
lol mckennas reaction yup thats
idiot enjoy championship
honestly first yellow received soft one wasnt simulation worthy yellow even though try make
first card trash ref lost control first half
really criminal youre relagated already doesnt mean must act like douchebag scumbag
briish accent
first one dive add spice idiocy
relegation battle
isnt relegation battle already lol
simulation burn stuck leg right outside newcastle penalty box johnson jumped maybe little dramatically
surprised got paid fuck whole season
walking towards manager might exchange
foot rest season
show lack quality football brain swear happened last like 4 week well
first card exactly kind card id like see fkin hate diver
dive
relax man tactical foul tactical braindead yellow nothing malicious
oh calm youre acting like he two footed dumb second yellow though
youre sausage even good one
watch british football people british accent
scottish precise
first yellow dive foul enciso also dive joke refereeing
first division relegation battle
yeah jesting
feel relegation war begin
battle relegated
yeah saw live id like another look
wasnt even egregious dive something fell pulling tackle unless want footballer run full speed clatter knee knee clumsy leg left ref wave one play
gave card consistently match would finish keeper v keeper much dive one given penalty
really wasnt lol watch replay burn clearly stick big leg johnson jumping avoid dont make contact foul burn 100 impedes johnson ref didnt even pull card crowd made noise
chelsea fan watching felt disrespected really
didnt say sound bad anything cant stop amazed every time hear new way speak english island
bringing comparison disallowed goal also dive palmer overall balanced
joke giving delap burn yellow pushing eachother equally ball even play either talked
begun relegation war
well seem fighting lol
obviously seeking foul stuck leg dived kicking like could also lead injury blatant diving ruining game penalised much harder imo want game contact sport really dislike diving exaggerating contact rolling floor etc
game would clean consequence diving exaggerating led type behaviour fine mean nothing people playing mean world hit hurt
throwing burn even started tackle obvious dive leg stuck seek contact
nothing wrong appreciating interesting accent
indeed var need reformed
anakin higher goal difference
burn also super late tackle left leg right path running imo win situation burn making challenge would foul make contact johnson limited option thats nature game ref say play move past incident instead dwelling theyre much worse incident like fake head injury get tapped head butt roll around like tried kill make game much less enjoyable
killed killed theyre dead every single one saint fox tractor boy theyre like animal slaughtered like animal hate

wait watch second year time season 5
yeah need build roster bit rob ryan keep injecting club money could totally happen insane thing think
yeah surprising
yeah owner rich
im troll
thing crazy rich lower level especially national league theyre getting point theyre rich far ownership go
infinite money good management work see birmingham city
damn didnt know needed spend money good let google man united real quick
rich owner league whose club didnt get promotion alone isnt enough
arent nearly rich many owner competing
compared league one owner really arent even top 10 wealthiest owner league
still surprising expected mount solid midtable run back back hope maybe scrapping playoff spot get back back back way beyond expectation
ryan reynolds massive brain many ridge wouldnt understand level intelligence incomprehensible
dont even expensive payroll league 1 yeah financial advantage ownership group big fish tiny pond pale comparison even money league one let alone championship decidedly rich compared ownership group
stupid
thats theyve already sold share allen family billionaire brought ownership group
think recently brought rich shareholder remember yeah there going need extra cash u ryan rob simply cant compete ownership group championship say though unique nature tv show offer extra incentive financial beyond far attracting talent extra revenue spend
chelsea wouldve better example go
cuh player championship level
flair check
idk theyve nearly spent billion one mathematically safe relegation one may qualify champion league

kinda expected unai vilireal time villa didnt make semi cl
he also spent decent amount dont think binary assessment coach he clearly done boat load good work establishing villa club europe good player question would whats next id say trophy represents forward momentum tricky part villa squad summer three big money loan playersid say two decision hanging themand four five player loan need find home
thats classic unai feeling tbh
exclusively fault
stats dont reflect better minute 1
stats accurately reflect game football weird like time palace comfortable whole game
losing psg 54 aggregate villa bracket losing palace lol anything exceeded expectation psg
ridiculous thing say lol failure villa lose 54 aggregate psg seen managerial history right honestly people say dumb shit
bringing psg game like emery fault ridiculous actually watched game would know donnarumma played one best game
admittedly limited sample size seems like emery start fade season go whereas glasner get stronger towards end season
hey dont say glasner dog walked emery lasted season
mate get youre angry lad exhausted palace fresher champ league stretched thin although think emery could managed squad better he played rogers ground example
dont know heard name match honestly
last 29 year
mean hard take anything say seriously weve played champion league football season birmingham league 1
came championship 5 season ago played psg fight back back champion league participation dont see whats sting
palace trophy note history
single yippeekiyay second half
stature youre winning trophy

fantastic isnt
he steadily getting better month he motm performance recently
also make people criticised arsenal drawing lowly palace look clever
havent seen anything linking u eze dont see wed big price particularly upgrade u good
villa 16 shot attempt 5 target majority possession legit could scored couple defense kept cool box henderson great save chance creation break better sometimes team get beaten even show

there single starting player proud performance today im taking anything away palace statement great needed step didnt
counting disallowed goal stood
said last tournament starting wasnt alone fully agree starter england he good
bringing big game emery villa never said fault watched game thank much donnarumma outstanding second leg first leg couldve goal overall tie better team leg
man four europa league cant judge based
know get done europa league sometimes forget 3 row around decade ago surprised see even make final last season conference league glasner done great job started season really bad form turned around massively
mean villa champ league palace didnt huge difference come late april
villa twice much rest game

bet sting
guy cant score cant pas run 180 minute think glasner realized turned dm type player
link go think big price pay problem think hed slot well one winger 10 eze well take kdbs spot
hed upgrade grealish immediately
im tired excuse every time play since glasner arrived last four villa match ended 50 22 41 30 thats 14 goal 3 played arsenal wednesday played tuesday maybe possible good beating
theyll see villa literally beat psg home still contention ucl qualification comment late stage emery got knocked cup semi final arsenal didnt even reach
death tax neutral emery revisionism every villa win arsenal loss guaranteed
death tax villa cunt cry wembley guaranteed
arsenal didnt fall away last season quite reverse werent quite good enough
arteta already trophy u

whether he performing
speaking supporting fake club here get city flair httpsredditcomrsoccerwflairutm_mediumandroid_apputm_sourceshare
beat brighton
ew yea guess
thats fair shame season petered like take edge somewhat
v pissed southgate gave zero minute euro blatantly obvious needed player profile lose control match time tournament partly dont seem rate player like carrick wharton
alternatively got knocked champion league twice row wouldnt even opportunity better current system
whats done since trophy
know get done europa league always
genuinely ran steam conference league injury coming hurting u massively came olympiacos ripped u apart
disingenuous much know im talking effect whole season
weve played 10 game palace season twice much rest isnt gon na cover extra 900 minute
okayi mean villa objectively successful club
england lot club size though therere many trophy win
zenith data system cup everton one count
played glasner frankfurt kamada seen past couple game kamada glasner bought start season
villa fan way go much better u areyet time time thump different system formation interact differently unai number
idiotic side fan base awful general come wood work whenever villa lose big game
arsenal beat psg home season also exactly point
emery revisionism dont see villa fan thread neutral trying wind facing relegation showed he got u fighting top end table pushing deep europe he world class care happened arsenal anymore five year ago he moved club moved didnt work
yup cant even hit back wembley performance stunk place
cmon man give credit emery squad
yeah like 30 fuckin year ago
think he done fine given massive villa investment id expect trophy least yeah
fan either lol togetherness god squad side obviously key team spirit
thats bit harsh though order get knocked champion league win like team competing would expected win took villareal semi villa quarter losing liverpool psg respectively pretty great run club
european cup whole club sure want question method
made villa really good team fighting champion league place regular
thats true cant win every year manager arsenal last 30 year ever anything europe gone amount champion league final tottenham time period see guy win champion league season otherwise mikel artetas nearly men tag continue
millennium successful one one grandad nappy
true team like u swansea pompey trophy timespan disappointed
might least aweinspiring name could cup
im insulting arsenal im saying calling late stage emery tad ridiculous villa fine know people get sensitive arsenal sub see thought
totally agree think he good manager done great villa get annoyed whenever emery win game isnt expected win there shout shouldnt let go
one guy squad give credit guy didnt make sense
see muñoz come eze arsenal goal appeared tell thank god im religious seem gelling level
considering he managed club pretty shit job yes much like comment remotely relevant
quite possibly liverpool fancoded response entire thread tbh
honestly amount money theyve spent thats bare minimum
meanthe current one played champion league football birmingham league 1
dont disagree
emery op criticising anyway villa fan im sure probably villa sub
nah wasnt working didnt control dressing room another universe maybe would worked didnt arteta right guy
meeting expectation spend lot better lot team league fair im sure people expect overperformed europe expected league cup semi good obviously disappointing get knocked palace clearly impacted amount match played see often team dont traditionally get top 4 suffer year villa really arent badly people trying portray
warra trophy
birmingham actually trophy century
yeah calling late stage emery wrong criticism anything like final day arsenal everything crumbling currently
embarrassing behaviour haha

gateshead truro city might longest away league trip english history
torquay scored 2 goal would level truro point goal scored goal conceded goal difference whats next tiebreaker
absolute madness torquay truro absolutely determined win gd imagine winning 41 away enough guarantee promotion gd
nice long away day next season
truro carlisle distance truro paris btw mental away slog
actually insane close top nls table
someone doesnt know much english football england general whats reason cornwall never team play national league higher
carlisle v truro league game next year word
truro tipped favourite get relegated way incredible achievement next season tough stay especially travel anything possible
man great feeling must themcongrats
closest away game yeovil 2 half hour drive away
good
cornish pasty time
pasty everyone
cornish pixy
newcastle 2 week ago live outside truro lovely 9 hour drive lol
least gateshead near large airport
gateshead fan away day matter
lived south west truro viewed bit outlier among cornish club competitive higher level idea changed lot club tended refuse promotion travelling somewhere like bristol regular basis would crippled financially interesting see truro able cope national travel
fall count anywhere match
win think
number win truro lead 1
match
truro 52 torquay 41 eastbourne 30 worthing 51 top 4 best could compete 1st place
classic torquay always showing end season still like chance getting back real national league year never giving league 2 dream
live near torquay day south along coast even cant arsed going cornwall might well end earth looked shortest away day season wouldve torquay would take 151 get right bonkers away travel
county small population less money big team truro pushing needed cornwall whole
reason big rugby area rugby union probably popular sport unlike football much rest country applies wider south west area significantly less major football club rest country
gatesheadtruro hartlepooltruro
really interesting see get speaking experience ebbsfleet fan national league really really tough day even one greatest nls season alltime subsequently shown literally none squad good enough national league
best footy scran going half time pasty go hard
id go gateshead away grab loganair newquay think
take cross country truro newcastle
unless guy win playoff
ladder match surely
playoff cracking well
compared 12 month ago like different club proper community club
beast getting cornwall im train past plymouth mean im going london inbetween
get truro yeovil area massive ball ache via train amount delay cancellation etc driving isnt much better take age thats going closest away day
thought population factor well first checked list english county lesspopulated county cornwall club national league higher cumbria shropshire herefordshire bristol guessed reason well another user mentioned mainly rugby area less money part explain cornwall seems weak football
fact closest professional academy hour away doesnt help real challenge parent justify amount travel give kid marginally better chance becoming pro
see make sense considering quickly checked map look like club south west area premier league efl guess cornwall must pretty good rugby
logan air flight mad expensive sadly wish flybe still around
checked saturday timetable look like there direct train leaving truro 7am get newcastle 430pm time final whistle 140 way
there enough room bloody train normal day imagine adding maybe 100 football fan nightmare
seen form getting let alone winning
watch maidstone win mile behind everyone else
_maidstone swerve everyone steal it_
lesspopulated county cornwall club national league higher cumbria shropshire herefordshire bristol well sure empty bit county havent really league side either place like carlisleherefordshrewsbury population 6000080000 bristol city half million people cornwall population much spread even biggest town 25000 people add remoteness general also specifically english football traditional heartland surprising
weve union county cup number time last handful year yes
think even spenny id culture
grief flying domestic trip uk train sure dont make fucking easy avoid
wont league stop participating anyway
actually make sense show clueless english county haha
thats cleared play playoff qualify
remoteness big one arguably remote club efl barrow train manchester counter also far like morecambe carlisle fleetwood blackpool still good catchment area professional player cornwall really exeter plymouth nearby professional club sign player potentially bristol club thats threehour drive cornwall plenty club like weston torquay would competing signature

one cowardly refereeing decision ive seen
keeper overprotected biggest football hate
even get called monitor absolute joke var
palmer going okay expected make full recovery
absolute stupid fucking bullshit
absolute joke call prime example overprotected gks
literally stand still foul
absurd thats called considering corner open season keeper lately
absolutely atrocious decision keeper went bruno way round
foul var say thats foul bruno literally stand make move towards keeper fanny ball joke
palmer knob bruno literally stand still walk goalkeeper protected also overturned var
truly loathe stupidly protected keeper
thats bullshit palmer extremely weak shouldve goal
might biased possibly goal ruled see people pulled fixture week foul referee var shit bed badly
haha fuck pathetic decision official man
isnt clear obvious foul
keeper bump bruno foul lmao okay
ridiculous call keeper protection laughable time
getting ruled arsenal 15 goal worse season thats litterally exactly situation create every corner
reminder half people convinced never decision go u
bruno standing menacingly
think case touch keeper get foul except keeper touched shrug
shocking call
var spent 2 second joke
var bottle another intervention whats fucking point
bad fkn call
yet dipshits still claim get preferential treatment arsenal released club statement less
dont thunk bruno literally stand still he obviously backing keeper however think palmer exceptionally pathetic dont think foul yes bruno backed dont see get way
dislike newcastle likely next average guy farce goal shouldve stood
doesnt look goalkeeper turn back get goal keeper going make mistake regardless gave ref easy choice make
thing think var didnt call back came bruno arm angle looked like might saw came anything arm one worst var miss ive seen
attempt play ball deliberate attempt obstruct obstruction foul
think foul stop lean weight towards keeper try catch
look keeper back opinion seems reasonable enough
exactly ref doesnt want actually say everyone see id love know acceptable level contact keeper thats
referee pretty poor throughout whole game several moment stern warning wouldve enough instead went straight handing yellow card even newcastle fan thought harsh ben johnson got booked simulation committed genuine yellow card offense ref choice send felt bit top
boiling blood since like 10 get much privilege whatever fuck want box everyone elses hazard
shit happened leicester liverpool ref rewriting rule cant contact keeper pgmol need stop crap keeper need stronger committed going ball air everyone right play edit man hypocrisy sub wanting complain call happened rich club call essentially shit sub arguing foul last week cant way sure brigade downvotes lmao
palmer brunohttpsexternalcontentduckduckgocomiuuhttps3a2f2fikymcdncom2fentries2ficons2ffacebook2f0002f0442f5062fstanding_there_menacinglyjpgf1nofb1iptc96a0db23c088fba6b999fd942c849d533ddd74065a914f24c5c588de4504315
make even crazy couldve easily caught even punched
lot blind look right lean keeper
im saying particular situation wouldnt say goalkeeper protected season saw many goal corner foul goalkeeper continues go goalkeeper may start oliver kahning striker close also team playing corner yeeting ball 5 yard box corner game ruin football bit
yeah dont understand whatever want keeper corner every situation cant touch
tbf soft af pen got blame
exactly bruno obligation vacate space gon na next 1 1 keeper keeper shout keeper striker step aside let
yes looking turning back player notoriously foul
handball take two look
want go route every corner season would instantly called penalty free kick though
watched arsenal match last 2 season literally every corner never given foul ref shouldnt giving randomly theyve ignored year
1 direct free kick direct free kick awarded player commits following offence impedes opponent contact httpswwwthefacomfootballrulesgovernancelawsandruleslawsfootball1111law12foulsandmisconduct
_leans_ oh humanity
think youre trying say stand ground doesnt roll red carpet goalkeeper come gracefully collect ball goal
team corner technique literally load keeper none goal corner stood
palmer embarrassing disallowing wouldnt keep night amount people claiming literally nothing baffling
everton flair would argue leicester goal even remotely controversial decision clown
lmao liverpool one zero eye ball went alissons rib whilst mid air agree keeper overprotected thats example happening given foul across pitch
disallowed invading keeper personal space give rest mate
player isnt allowed hold position goalkeeper barge player standing fall get foul
yeah he even looking ball look palmer turn back interfere sell acting like palmer pushed
yeah hed given goal side prof ref useless rather corrupt
im saying im saying made easy decision ref make considering blew whistle instantly
hmm cant quickly play clearly come arm pointing something didnt see mentioned im newcastle fan biased hopethink goal
happens corner keeper always free kick
giving arsenal issue 100 agree benefitted favourable call part routine deliberate obstrctuion involved
still foul might seem subtle thing he trying obstruct keeper go catch
hasnt corner tactic since last season overloading one post
explain every pundit thought controversial wtf lmao im case leicester player least played ball case didnt albeit tried get way perfectly legal right edit mfer want call people flair want hide biased gtfoh
zero eye ball pas teammate allison wasnt mid air need watch back yall rewriting history
standing spot turning back impeding keeper sure foul
disallowed deliberately impeding keeper
he clearly trying impede keeper hold ground keeper get protection thing like ridiculously exploitable otherwise unless youre happy see 4 defender surround keeper hold position completely trapping
he looking ball see palmer moving towards hold position
easy decision player something legal like player look another player ball committing foul going header stood still decision make give goal
arsenal entire corner system exactly guy place making life hard keeper moving way never issue
let hear take every set piece arsenal scored past two year
keeper doesnt right catch ball punch palm away
every pundit gary neville
take blue tinted spec
regardless bruno stance palmer expecting phase
exactly palmer planning going phasing bruno
thats exactly arsenal season goal given
hold position except look started looking palmer contact made literally see kept moving httpsimgurcomazbsj0el
looking keeper actively turning regardless whether lot contact going make easy decision ref especially protected keeper stood facing let keeper flap hand didnt stand turned back lot obviously enough ref make decision quickly
every post game thing watched hated call least 5 different analyst said terrible call
literally go watch analyst talk said thing yall want say good call fine operate isnt foul outfield player foul keeper clearly yall want apply rule differently different situation edit yet another red doesnt flair brigade comment pointing inconsistency
go catch punch ball people allowed stand fron play fucking game
doesnt really matter deliberately impeded zero attempt actually play ball
rewatch clip look number 15
keep saying turning back turning back foul offence look face turn back hokey cokey neither reason disallow goal
literally get shoved rib pitch jumping catch ball
cant tell side youre arguing mate think decision correct indoor voice please
intent play ball pushed 15 keeper coming towards definition simply existing position impeding palmer
think bruno pushed hard enough clatter palmer must think weighs 10 kilo
giving ref mind reason fluffed ball justification blow whistle eye whether agree
rewriting fact allison still ground half assed went ball clip keeper fully air newcastle even playing logic even egregious match
decision farce bruno stood turned back palmer decided wasnt gon na make attempt play ball instead put swim trunk went splash remember bernd leno getting fucking held year back match brentford ref like nah foul arsenal started crowding keeper corner people would complain foul arsenal player stood ground
pushed ipswich player
body turned way burgess pushed albeit lightly anyway palmer planning going morphing bruno catch ball
offence turning back someone isnt foul keeper right space pitch anyone else particularly someone already occupying ref cant call foul arent foul like oh well looked funny
im side mate hahaha
want say bruno impeded keeper think fair say pushed pushing limit arent definitely pushed extent every right exaggerate 15 pushed left shoulder body twisted accordingly
lol hilarious pissed goal yellow diving 2nd yellow obvious yellow red previous ineptitude im angry pgmol im yelling reddit id go touch grass raining day lol

purple patch banik actually challenge big 3
sparta praha low
direct ucl seat good
league fit description jose mourinho said 2018 would unfair remember seeing plzen champion league past could another country league pocket kind league win even start
likely nothing longterm unfortunately last time slavia trophy 20202021 big three also wasnt fully together jablonec sneaking bronze position didnt result able challenge big three following season assume gon na similar story baník hope im wrong
theyve really good see either three finishing 2nd reaching ucl qualifier long run sparta plzeň probably better
well sparta kinda shit year helped played 4 qualifying match uecl also probably helped
coach priske left feyenoord theyve made bad transfer
nah always big question mark start season champion slavia sparta plzeň like scotland 2teams league czech 3teams league
2021 slavia 2022 plzeň 2023 sparta 2024 sparta 2025 slavia
yeah itll difficult baník play european cup challenging big 3 neither jablonec slovácko could year ago theyll probably 4th next year several point behind 3rd
wait made bad transfer tho
ah ok thanks thats interesting big win slavia season
poor scouting guess
verwacht er niks van ik heb slechts èèn keer sparta gelijk zien spelen de arena denk eigenlijk dat het een hele saaie wedstrijd gaat worden
goede keuze om kitolano op te stellen ipv eiting meer power en inzet op het middenveld heeft sparta wel nodig deze wedstrijd eiting kan altijd nog invallen
steijn weer de arena hopelijk doet ie weer waar ie goed verliezen
dat zon 23 schoten op doel maar 11 wedstrijd ofzo toch
ik denk dat het een 00 dat de tijd van suarez dat een wonder dat ajax die niet
valid criticism see stupid neutral venue singleleg system possibly foreign player rule unlike past tourney doesnt make sense east asian team dont get home game star player might well stick east west separated final
east form oceania make new confederation roughly lenght opposite side vertically horizontally game played around timezone club football fairtheres lot parity nowadays top east side team top southeast asian team hold east asian team
left east west final
probably cause future issue
somewhat comparable happened europe decade later
saudi also reduced team 40 24
al ahli 30 al nassr winning 30 right
isnt new though al hilal best club side asia theyve asian cl anyone else anyways
dont understanding benefit exclusively saudi arabia though japan korea china uae iran qatar spent money instead would dominating also mentioned half goal scored yesterday local saudi foreigner aside 6 club saudi league rest small transfer budget yet beat al ahli al ittihad al hilal al nassr league cup first division team even knocked al ahli domestic cup 70 loss humiliating stage logic weekly occurrence smaller saudi club facing top 4 yet people tend ignore fact saudi league best coefficient since 2021 whole money thing saudi club tournament club like al hilal al nassr many good performance past edition long story short logical country spends hundred million billion dominate competition competitor use fraction matter venue time
arsenal 71 v psv round 16 fairness left tournament fifa need split europe fair competition
sound like someone got destroyed 70 pissed even talking shit match
sound like skill issue league competition world rich team poor team rich team always perform better genuinely dont understand complaining

also fan saudi football hasnt al hilal consistently one best asian side decade
uefa cl still home away match till final tournament
country favoured uefa
similar thing change good bad gradual everytime there new change please big 5 federation like 1 power rest set rule want there currently big disparity power quality premier league rest still big saudi arabia rest afc
largely agree core point new acle format doesnt exclusively benefit saudi arabia nation similar investment could theoretically gain similar advantage saudi club arent guaranteed success shown al smaller saudi club format reward heavy spending strong infrastructure saudi arabia currently exemplifies rigged system ensuring dominance observation local player competitive upset spotonfootball remains unpredictable tactical execution trump budget however id add critical caveat exclusive format undeniably skewed toward saudi arabia strength centralized final jeddah removal foreign player limit focus top league align saudi arabia financial muscle hosting capability afcs choice saudi arabia multiple year exclusion smaller nation suggest strategic tilt toward maximizing competition commercial appeal saudi arabia starstudded team enhance one thing note thats incorrect statement quarterfinal onward match singleleg tie hosted saudi arabia jeddah 202425 202526 season provisional hosting right three year afc suggest creates tournament atmosphere eliminates homeandaway tie later stage saudi club consistently reach final stage home advantage could compound time
lmao yeah getting smacked 70 suck doubt think scoreline fact one side unlimited oil money stacked european allstar squad literal homefield advantage pretending neutral youre either trolling willfully ignoring rigged whole setup talking trash match normal game already set one side win really trash talk false hope
yeah bro kinda hard get good one side basically fielding fifa ultimate team squad unlimited cash restriction everyone else stuck playing career mode hard mode tournament hosted saudi saudi ref saudi rule saudi team stacked half europe starting xi really competition anymore scripted w
dont home away afc gaslight everyone thinking feasible east v west simply true 20 year ago home away east west national team match every international break last 50 year team playing west one day 5 day later play away east go fine afc fully controlled gcc build everything advantage majority 2000s east asian much better club west split tournament final guarantee west asian team final pendulum swung suddenly dont need split west east anymore wait still saudi arabia asian champion league virtue largest population 30 football mad country much much much bigger deal reality soulless competition people continent dont care
yeah arewere zoom al hilal saudi league general hard see anyone compete anymore difference saudi league rest best asian league wasnt high degree parity thats effectively already gone like ucl team going league 1 team saudi league imo hasnt even reached peak yet star bringing theyre already getting result get spend theyre successful id rather cl parity exciting
agree venue chosen year prior edition al beat al hilal al nassr showing guarantee saudi club play home truthful highly doubt venue would make large difference say saudi club playing european xi foreigner agree refer point spending exclusive saudi arabia much smaller saudi club regularly compete giant entire saudi favoring idea could easily disproved country started spending may seem skewed towards saudi arabia currently thats theyre willing spend money promote league extension asian football look uefa champion league handle foreigner quota correlate generate much money prestige end day obvious wealthiest dominate im sure unfair dont see croatian team right complain face english spanish club
think fair point home advantage isnt going happen every year complaining fair saudi club better signing wild there nothing stopping east invest football
dont home advantage stadium completely different city best team asia even oil money dont see complaining
saying true blatantly playing advantage one side

bro come different city doesnt change fact still country fan climate comfort zone think flying 10 hour middle east local support feel remotely neutral yeah al hilal always strong pretending current gap isnt supercharged endless spending coping there big difference top club assembling literal allstar team league turned europe 20 overnight people arent cry losing theyre pointing competition isnt even pretending fair anymore
unlikely better ffphomegrownforeigner rule else one outside three four saudi club give shit competition push come shove though competition solely east club could lot fun a3 champion cup could make comeback

hi yes translated transcript im non native english speaker fine tune native language ai carry previous translation request forward said basic sportsmanship always valued considered afc want keep tournament integrity rethink longterm hosting balance format give every underdog real shotbecause thats make football worth watching speaking sincerely small nation asia

genuine question madridistas rm tv official club channel btw supposed shitpost nobody pay attention anyway make clear simply rm tv likely directive coming club appreciate kind tone question always knew never argument made good faith deflection save face theyll find another rmtv would never broadcast anything interest florentino madrid management lack supervision rogue editor whatever wouldve quick reject officially instead theyve putting pressure referee whole season inhouse medium rest outlet massive influence marca chiringuito etc always official line madridistas know well
channel always operated according club wish anyone claiming otherwise trying white knight club stuff viewership used trueand probably still isbut age social medium everything get shared incredibly large audience narrative silly way deflect actual issue video honestly dont know referee could realistically response maybe boycotting real madrid match rm tv target would probably lead even abuse rfef need step protect referee far theyve done absolutely nothing press conference could haveand still canbeen catalyst start process pablo gonzález fuertes kind messed comment escalated thing madrid side hopefully whoever pushing pressure campaign finally realizes referee people put end shameful nonsense

european trophy since 2000 tell laliga atletico almost 3 time valencia got 2 final
el clasico always anyones game form season otherwise isnt usually predictor anyrhing happen still expecting barcelona win
ferran pretty good lately lewa level fine
ferran decently space real madrid give away least theory depends barca want control midfield value counterattack run behind approach start prefer olmo starting false 9 today though think would work pretty well midfield pedri de jong gavi behind assert complete midfield dominance early think real madrid crumble really quick obviously drop gavi start olmo midfield instead think gavi add little extra spice needed type game also help apply pressure ball carrier prevent real madrid counter themself punish barca high line stop madrid attacking build team momentum add midfield dominance top well essentially looking 3 goal game barca
mbappes match win carlo last chance trophy think real gon na get pumped like never expect least red card
clownshow stunt madrid pulled yesterday probably never wanted barca win game
like need striker beat madrid ask arsenal
ferran supremacy
watch rat real magically win boast age

fine lewas finding spot dance
oh seeing report also miss wednesday ucl game
madrid aint ready shark attack
also olmo option play sort false 9 work lewa doesnt really press high olmo midfield anyways
mbappe fit bench
mbappe may play wont near top level injured
mbappé injured bench
red card madrid lmao camavinga vini sent within 60 minute obviously neither got red
red card madrid dont belong sentence
minor correction referee pulled clown show stunt yesterday
excuse form top striker mikel merino
hey rat cool
didnt boast beat 40 2 season ago knocked cl city unlike barcelona fan posted 40 comment madrid fan made 40 didnt help win league thats meme barca fan celebrate winning match madrid fan celebrate winning trophy came
olmos biggest strength would bottlenecked there striker work he great creating space others used create space clinical striker unfortunate lewandowski got injured olmo came back injury dont get play big match duo theyre spatially aware clinical player ferran much less
ooof didnt know

yeah ref aint man altho game became even entertaining red
ref absolutely shocking game team regard
shouldnt overturned feel like ref know robbed u goal var told look went give u chance
game gone
youre going disallow bruno goal something soft standing still fair give penalty something soft slight tug murphy arm
bruno goal stood ben shouldnt received first yellow pen 5050
remember everton 5 minute var decision overturn penalty contact var implementation literally joke
maybe ipswich played football instead rugby wouldve stayed season coming
love either team absolutely shameful award yellow simulation game gone infuriating
epl corruption full display
tced isak egregious pen lmfao like im happy fuming
he got everything wrong except 2nd yellow imo
absolute bonkers decision across board mind boggling bad he
well there 6 stoppage he given 1 minute crazy
yep utter inconsistency id fine actually calling hold consistently stick defender change play style right russian roulette gambling ref var decide call
goal got bruno foul referee utter utter dogshit
go back league much better smh taking spot league cant even get house doesnt leak
agreed game gone
johnson dived bruh come please better ref dogshit tho
one involved physical contact
idk think first yellow guy got sent make
weve battering multiple line clearance bar hit fine goal disallowed people arent happy unless putting 10 past every low block meet ffs
course hasnt actually watching game
ironically 2 wrong made right didnt agree either major decision ref 10
ref wrongly disallowed newcastle goal game
game watching
dunno depends many time opponent want assist
mad disallowed obvious goal theyre trying help u
mean ipswitch 9 men
valid fair goal disallowed clown
taking piss keeper walked bruno gave away goal got chalked
still less help liverpool got season
clearly watching game
awoken horde
bro rattled whole fanbase
explain bruno goal disallowed
tried playing football earlier season didnt work either
incompetence disallowed goal u nothing he completely lost control game
pretty much
tbf captained isak given newcastle deserved score one goal id rather isak pen first one
get bad cant even remember matchday without ref fuckin usually multiple instance
sir without shitter get relegated season
absolutely didnt dive
wasnt dive fell contact doesnt make foul either player embellish correct action wouldve play harm foul
he disguising well case
disallowed perfectly fine newcastle goal didnt hand morsey red card
he he terrible
literally robbed newcastle goal
biased disallowed goal someone standing still incompetent sure
shouldnt dived
dont think he u shit though
literally legal goal disallowed soft card soft pen level bad refereeing
mean person obviously watching game making vacuous comment always going annoy people
mean ref disallows clear goal everyone say goal say ref bias towards side whose goal disallowed people gon na think youre clueless
fair enough
seriously var somehow making worse really shame want fair match fan im sure player
fair enough someone put fry bag learn value dont good officiating
prefalling burn force field
view far side show clearly dive run whatever minimal contact without issue drag foot go
100 biased foootball
dive good work dive bad team
well mean rewarded dive
imagine confidence talk like 15th
he avoided burn leg he going get clattered dive
wasnt dive why putting arm anyway prevent running taking shotmaking pas great position absolute pen
pssssh joke making fun certain group people know reddit slow stuff sometimes lighten
avoided practically run burn fall begging foul thats simulation nothing running player isnt foul even though keeper convinced ref earlier
amazing one get see slowed havent played football last 10 year life course youre gon na jump way defender going clatter anticipating contact getting way isnt always diving middle ground diving foul
genuinely believe slight tug arm enough go
funny dont worry babe reddit worst sense humour
want card making contact every match end eight side thought primarily interested selfpreservation
believe foul doesnt go doesnt get called contact enough stop murphy getting ball could made something happen absolutely need put hand
see perspective see ref felt simulation think weve much worse call match though ref playing different set rule im familiar
fair enough believe thats foul think soft definitely nowhere near clear obvious error also think doesnt jump floor actually still make ball
